# KivaProject
Kiva is a microlending website that allows people to make loan contributions to small entrepreneurs. Some loan postings on the Kiva website get funded fully whereas some do not. In this project, we are working on predicting which loans will go unfunded and providing suggestions to try making their postings successful.
