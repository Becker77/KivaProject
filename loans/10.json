It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She  worked long hours from Monday to Sunday without a rest and had to leave her daughter in her mother's care.  However, as she became pregnant again, her mother found it very difficult to look after two children and consequently she had to leave her job.  This led to some economic difficulties, so Argenedith took advantage of the knowledge which she had about preparing snacks and came up with the idea of starting a business selling fried food in the patio of her home.  As it was very successful she moved to a street corner opposite a park which is very near her home and her number of customers increased.  She is very happy with her success and is also happy because she can look out for her children since she works 6 hours a day from Monday to Sunday.  When she finishes selling her food she can get her household chores done.  Argenedith supports her household expenses and earns twice what she was earning when she worked for somebody else's company.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Argenedith's first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy ingredients in bulk such as oil, fruit, corn, sugar and salt.  She will also buy an awning to protect her from the sun and the frequent rain and a cylinder of gas because her dream is to fit out her business well and make it more comfortable for her customers.  She would also like to manage to save some money together with her husband so that they can buy their own home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":652067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy ingredients in bulk such as oil, fruit, corn, sugar and salt.

She is 33 years old and the group leader of a nine-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJonna is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, she owns and operates a recycling service, hauling scrap metal for local businesses and community members. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $159 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Jonna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase scrap metals and bottles to sell. \r\n\r\nJonna is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase scrap metals and bottles to sell. This will be her 7th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

By working with the organization, she has managed to increase her working capital and gradually increase her profits.  She will use her Kiva loan to buy thongs (flip flops), notebooks, sweaters, shirts, threads, buttons, deodorants and jeans to sell.  Her dream is to own another sales location in a shopping mall where she will be able to expand more easily.  Her main challenge is being able to buy what people need and are requesting because she has very little capital in relation to the increase in her number of customers.  In the meantime, she continues to experience a rapid turnover of stock, make profits, re-invest them and cover her family

The products that Floriana has managed to grow with such hard work and dedication have helped her get ahead in life.

Regina is interested in joining the lending program and requesting a loan of IDR 4,500,000 from TLM. She wants to build a small kiosk in front of her house and expand the business stock by adding a greater variety of household needs such as sugar, coffee, tea, wheat flour, cooking ingredients, etc. Regina is hoping to get the loan as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":938495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase stock such as sugar, coffee, tea, wheat flour, cooking ingredients, etc. and to build a small kiosk.

This is 48-year-old Christina M. from Tukuyu. She is single and has four children between the ages of 16 and 20. Christina has run a food-selling business since 1992. She buys her goods from local farmers and sells them in nearby villages. She works at the business for 9-12 hours a day, seven days a week, with help from her children. Christina currently earns about $370 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 to purchase ten bags of maize, three bags of groundnuts and two bags of beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of the goods she has for sale. Christina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ten bags of maize, three bags of groundnuts and two bags of beans in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T16:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christina M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Pajac, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: General Store, Food Vending and Ready-to-Wear Clothes businesses.  She has four children who are 8 to 17 years old.  One of her children is already helping out in the businesses while the other three are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nJuditha joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Juditha has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,200, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 which she intends to use for her general store and food vending businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future of her businesses, her family, and her children's education. \r\n\r\nJuditha Y. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

","en":"Martha Luisa Becerra S. is 41 years old and lives in Los Almendros, municipality of Soledad, with two children age 12 and 14 years. That is where she runs her business called \u201cTienda y Comunicaci\u00f3n donde Martha\u201d (Shopping and Communication at Martha\u2019s), which she has been operating for ten years in a leased facility. \r\n\r\nShe offers a wide number of services: selling snacks, groceries and drinks, photocopies, internet, telecommunications, fax and even taking samples for laboratory tests. The business started by being distributed over two locations, one of which she lived in. This created high leasing costs, so she finally gave up one of the locations and is moving her business and lodging to the other.\r\n\r\nShe is assisted by her children and also has a part-time employee. She also challenges herself at noon, selling lunches and on week-ends selling hot dogs, hamburgers and fries. Martha wants a more promising future for her children, whom she wants to see becoming good and successful people.\r\n\r\nThe move means local adjustments requiring unbudgeted investments, but will result in greater time availability to meet the diverse business requirements. As a result she is requesting a Credikiva loan which will be invested in a metal shutter, a freezer and in the realignment of her business leases. This is her third financial loan granted by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation,  which has helped her establish her business in a very commercial and secure location. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to acquire a home of her own to provide the best living conditions for her children and ensure they receive quality education. Her greatest challenge is the high level of competence that requires her to constantly diversify her products and offer the multiple services her customers demand and need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":652102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Honey collected high in the mountains possesses rare vitamins and a unique taste. \r\n\r\nGulmira K., 53, is the leader of this group. She and her husband, a construction worker, have their own apiary. All day long they work hard to provide proper care for the bees. Honey has always been a means of good health for the entire family. \r\n\r\nFive years ago, Gulmira got the idea that her product could also be a profitable source of revenue. She started offering the product to her neighbors and acquaintances, and soon the demand became very high, and now she has regular customers. \r\n\r\nRecently she decided to attempt the export of honey to the neighboring country of Kazakhstan. For this purpose, Gulmira would like to get a loan of 20,000 KGS. She believes in a bright future for her business and expects to successfully repay the loan. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Micro-finance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She began this business 30 years ago, when she used to work in a sewing business in the French zone of Barranquilla. Her decision was influenced by the fact that she needed to manage her own time due to her familial responsibilities, especially to her 20 year old son who she has helped to get ahead and who has motivated her to buy a home, applying all her energy to work and saving for this purpose. \r\n\r\nThis is Isabel's sixth loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.

IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He works in this business alone, as his wife is a homemaker.  He has two children, and his oldest son left to work in Russia.  The youngest son is also involved in transportation services and also sometimes helps his father.  This is the second time Rauf is requesting a loan from Imon International; he has a good reputation and credit history.  Previous loan helped him to expand his business and maximize his profit.  Rauf is requesting a loan in the sum of $2000 for the purchase of a new car with the goal of expanding his business.

Koami Simon was born in 1972 in D\u00e9kpo. He is married and has two (02) children with four (04) other people he cares for. With an elementary level of education, he has worked as a taxi driver for ten years. His car is currently too old and the repeated repair fees it generates do not allow him anymore to meet the needs of his household therefore, there is a very bad ambiance in the house. Finally, he dropped the car in order not to spend the little savings he made on a car he will no longer be able to use. In the past, Mr A. Koami proved to be a very good head of family and took a very good care of his family. He is a trustworthy man deserving of financial support to restart business and improve the living conditions of his family.  \r\nM. A. Koami Simon today has saved $1,200 and needs a credit of $2,000 to purchase a new car that he will use as a taxi.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur A. Koami Simon, est n\u00e9 en 1972 \u00e0 D\u00e9kpo.

D\u2019un niveau d\u2019\u00e9tudes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires, il exerce le m\u00e9tier de chauffeur de taxi depuis 10 ans. Sa voiture actuelle est trop vielle et les frais de r\u00e9parations r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s qu\u2019elle occasionne, ne lui permettent plus de subvenir au besoin de son foyer, d\u2019o\u00f9 une tr\u00e8s mauvaise ambiance \u00e0 la maison. En fin de compte, il a du d\u00e9finitivement garer le taxi pour ne pas d\u00e9penser le peu d\u2019\u00e9conomie r\u00e9alis\u00e9e dans une voiture qu\u2019il ne pourra plus r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer. Par le pass\u00e9, Monsieur A. Koami Simon a fait preuve d\u2019un bon p\u00e8re de famille et a su bien g\u00e9rer son foyer et son affaire. Il est un homme de confiance qui m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre appuy\u00e9 financi\u00e8rement pour retrouv\u00e9 son emploi et am\u00e9liorer les condition de vie de sa famille.\r\n\r\nMonsieur A.

Her husband passed away 8 years ago from a fatal disease. She was on her own to raise her 2 children. Now, her oldest child is 20 years old and the other one is 17 years old. During difficult time, TYM Fund was a great help to her. Besides being able to borrow money, every time she is ill, she always gets help from the branch and other members. Before, she used the borrowed money on breeding pigs and chickens pretty effectively. Her average income is 150 USD\/month. Recently, she has been investing in breeding cows and this activity brings her a higher income. This time she wants to borrow 950 USD to buy more cows and she will sell them when the price is high enough. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb Th\u00e2n, 40 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1998.

Carlota makes sure to procure purses and wallets with innovative designs that are of high quality.  After 12 years in this line of work, she has every desire to keep going and continue financing the education of her two sons.

This is 36-year-old Joyce M. from Tukuyu. She is a widow with two children, ages 10 and 20. Joyce has made a living selling clothes since 2002. She buys her clothing wholesale and sells it retail to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe works at her business for eight hours a day, six days a week, earning about $140 a month. She is requesting a loan of $375 to buy additional clothing to sell to her customers. In the future, she plans to open another business selling shoes. Joyce thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

They have an average age of 37 and on average, 3 children. They live in the village of S\u00e9gou Coura Bamanan (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).<P>\r\n\r\nThey are mostly petty traders and found out about Soro Yiriwaso from another group of women from an association that partners with the micro-finance institution. After having correctly reimbursed their first two loans, they are on their third solidarity loan which will be used to buy 1600 yards of plastic fiber, 1 roll of string, 5 pieces of cork, 40 pieces of fired clay, 2 sacks of rice, and 10 lengths of \"wax\" (African print cloth). They do their buying at the big open-air market of  S\u00e9gou and sometimes buy rice in the stores of S\u00e9gou Coura. The 1600 yards of plastic fiber will be woven into nets on which \"senis\" and \"fon fons\" (floats?) are affixed. Thus they will have their own nets so that they are able to go fishing in the Niger River with their husbands or their children.<P>\r\n\r\n The fish are sold by the pile at the market of M\u00e9dine S\u00e9gou and around the village of S\u00e9gou Coura. The rice and the African print cloth known as \"wax\" (cloth that is much esteemed in West Africa) are sold retail from their homes or at the market of  S\u00e9gou Coura for cash or on credit to a clientele composed of men and women. \r\n\r\nTheir discounted average monthly profit is 30,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the interest on the loan and to buy school supplies for their children. Their goal is to be able to buy a pirogue (boat for fishing) and animals so that they can raise sheep and goats. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":268982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of fishing nets, \"wax\" African print cloth, and rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou                                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pama                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":50625.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135820},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50625.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033619},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":50625.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620987},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50625.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019952},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50625.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242697},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":50625.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678203}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T01:26:17Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":92144,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth is 48 years old and married with 5 children.

Still, they have demonstrated a strong will to succeed in the group meetings. The majority of the group works in businesses such as sales of shoes, fruit, make-up, and sweets. They also work in the manufacture of clothing, bread baking, and others are employed in businesses. Their skill in each area is at a high level, and this shows that they will succeed in whatever business they are in. The loan is designated for the growth of their businesses, the purchase of merchandise, incomes and supplies to improve their earnings, which will permit them to give their families a better quality of life. Though this is their first cycle, the members already have experience with credit in groups thanks to credits from institutions similar to Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He also practices small-scale farming of coffee and tea, which he sells through the coffee factory and the Kenya Tea Development Authority respectively. He also depends on the income from his pension, a home-based museum and a quarry to cater for the needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 45,000 Kenyan shilings from Juhudi Kilimo to venture into fish farming and poultry farming. He says that these projects will increase his sources of income and will enable him to pay school fees for his children and expand other projects on his farm. He faces the challenges of diseases and a lack of financing and markets for his products. In the future, he plans to expand his fish ponds so that he can be able to harvest fish in tonnes. He further comments that Juhudi is giving financial assistance to the farmers who have been neglected before and that Juhudi staff live up to their promises.\r\n\r\nSamson is 61 years old. He is married with four children, ages 22, 19, 16 and 14.

She shares her life with her husband and her four children.  They live together in their own home.  Clara has been selling vegetables in a small market in her town for more than 12 years.  She makes her sales every morning up until midday.  However, her day's work always begins early in the morning because she has to stock up with fresh vegetables early every day when the wholesalers are distributing to retailers.  Clara's products sell easily because customers always require vegetables to prepare their meals.  For this reason, her business is profitable.  She manages to make enough money to support her family and re-invest in her work.  For this reason, she will continue working on her market stall and hopes to expand her business even further.\r\n\r\nThis is Clara's 18th loan with MFP.

Born and raised in El Paso, Texas, Adrian has worked in restaurants since he was 14 years old.  When he decided to start a business, it made sense he start in an industry he already knew.  Adrian and his brother manage Wing Shack, with Adrian running restaurant operations and his brother in charge of finances.\r\n\r\nAdrian and his brother have had a hand in every aspect of Wing Shack from the beginning.  Wing Shack\u2019s menu is their own creation with their own recipes.  They bought an existing building and renovated it to fit the restaurant\u2019s needs.  They personally painted and remodeled the inside, and actually built the restaurant bar themselves.  \r\n\r\nAdrian heard of ACCION Texas-Louisiana through the local Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, after his bank denied him a loan.  Adrian\u2019s primary objective with this loan is to build credit.  This is the first loan Adrian has received for Wing Shack, having to this point relied on his own capital and loans from friends.  By building credit through this loan, Adrian will be able to qualify for greater financing in the future, if and when the need arises.  \r\n\r\nSince Wing Shack opened in March, 2010, it has consistently had strong sales.  The problem is that expenses sometimes have the money going out as quickly as it comes in.  When bills come in at once, it temporarily puts stress on cash flow.  The additional cushion this loan provides will ensure they have enough money to meet monthly operating costs.\r\n\r\nAdrian says, right now, his life is the business.  Down the road, Adrian would like to open a second Wing Shack in El Paso\u2019s western half, and possibly someday make it a franchise.  Adrian warns other business owners not to cut corners, and to properly insure their business.  Recently, there was an ice storm in El Paso that forced Wing Shack to close for three days.  Thankfully, the losses Wing Shack incurred are covered in its insurance policy.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":712663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Building

Her story is representative of both the members of her group and Esperanza's Dominican and Haitian (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients. \r\n\r\nHer group is based in the Samana peninsula in the east of the Dominican Republic, where running water and electricity are unavailable. Here she makes her home with her husband and three children in a simple structure comprised of wooden walls and a tin roof.\r\n\r\nAna originally came to Esperanza over six loans ago for the purpose of improving her business and she has proved herself very successful as an associate of Esperanza, repaying on time every time. She will use this new loan to invest in her coconut sales by buying some coconut trees (This is the best deal for the people selling coconuts. They buy the tree ready to harvest.) She plans to use the profits to purchase as many things as she can supply for her family and to continue to improve her home.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with access to the varied financial services they need.

She and her husband have been growing tomatoes and chili peppers for more than 20 years.  Margarita says that these crops require a great amount of attention and compost.  She helps her husband with growing these crops.  Once the tomatoes and chili peppers are harvested, she sells them by the case at the market.  She says she needs this loan to buy more seeds to store for moments when seeds are scarce and she is not able to buy them.  Margarita will also buy compost to fertilize her crops so that they will develop well.

Along the forests are thousands of rocks, several serving as billboards for political slogans, too many others as memorials.  The road opens up to an emerging little town, with a school on the right, and an avocado tree on the left.  Underneath the avocado tree sit 28 women, vying for the relief its branches offer from the unforgiving sun.  They have gathered here once a month for the past seven years.  The women of the Belen communal bank have overcome insurmountable odds, one loan at a time.  \r\n\r\n<P>The women of Belen come from a region rich in weaving, and many grew up learning the intricate art from their parents.  From the time they were young, they were working for meager wages in weaving factories, earning barely enough to survive, with no way to get ahead.  After joining Friendship Bridge, they were given the initial push they needed to escape their poverty.  Today, seven years later, every single woman has her own weaving business, earning a fair income that supports their families and even enough to send all their children to school.  They wear this success with a humble pride, supporting each other in their victories and obstacles.  \r\n\r\n<P>Ten of the 28 women are asking for a loan of 28,000 quetzales ($3,675), ranging from $300 to $400 per person.  Nine of the women will invest this money in their weaving businesses, purchasing thread to weave intricate huipiles (traditional blouses like the ones in the picture), skirts, scarves, and blankets.  A single huipil can take up to a month to make, and after an initial investment of about 200 quetzales ($25), it can be sold for around 500 quetzales ($65).  All the supplies are purchased in the nearby town of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n.  A few of the women also employ as many as five other women, and part of the loan will go towards paying their salaries. Having the extra help greatly increases production (which is essential when a single product takes a month to make), and therefore adds significantly to the potential income.  One woman also runs a small store, selling snacks, soft drinks and daily necessities such as soap and toilet paper.  She plans to restock her store and add new varieties of snacks to keep her customers interested.\r\n\r\n<P>The women of Belen have come very far over the past seven years and they don\u2019t plan on stopping. They want to expand their businesses; the ones who currently work alone would like to someday hire help.  They would also like to expand to other nearby markets, bringing in new customers.  Everything they do is for the future of their children, and their dreams revolve around educating their children, with the hope that they can learn to read and write, and someday become professionals, free of the hardships of their parents."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3675,"image":{"id":134646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

She is married to Luis Ramos Salazar and they have 2 small children.\r\nShe has always work as a cobbler and remembers that her first job was to prepare the shoe, meaning that she attached the insoles and labels, cleaned them of any glue and packed them in their boxes.

is 38 years old and lives with his wife and 2 children. Recently he has gotten involved in agriculture, as his parents were farmers in their area and now he wishes to follow in their footsteps. For this reason he is giving his all to his land, where he is busy all day long. The harvest is what gives him the most pleasure from his work, since he can pick the products that cost him so much work in cultivating and caring. Nevertheless, the most difficult thing is acquiring the fertilizers necessary for his plots, since they are very expensive and raise the level of investment required in production. Zarifjon draws strength from his 2 children, whom he supports so that they may become professionals. He wishes to invest in the various fertilizers he needs for his crops, so that he can increase his production and his profits.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To increase the number of cattle, she decided to get a loan from Microinvest to buy a cow.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Josh Machleder, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":290365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T16:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muyassar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":247.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":254.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":262.42},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":270.3},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":278.41},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":286.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69.57},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.02},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.57,"local_amount":247.36,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":261.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120878},{"amount":71.65,"local_amount":254.78,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":269.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36016033},{"amount":73.81,"local_amount":262.42,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":277.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599760},{"amount":76.02,"local_amount":270.3,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":286.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994200},{"amount":78.31,"local_amount":278.41,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":294.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215483},{"amount":80.64,"local_amount":286.73,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":303.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644975}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T19:07:54Z","paid_date":"2009-10-10T10:31:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joshua Machleder","image":145052}},{"id":100352,"name":"Lucille","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Lucille C. is 26 years old and married.

She has two children who are her priority in life and she tries to satisfy their needs.  She and her husband hope to have their own house to live in soon.  Right now they live in her parents' house.  In the time she has lived with her husband, she has tried to support him with their home's expenses.  She has worked for three years selling cosmetics.  Every month she has to look for customers who will order from her catalogs.  Her job is tiring.  She has to walk for long hours on the streets with the goal of increasing her orders and obtaining a good percentage of the purchase of each product.  Because of this, she tries to make the most of sales and acquire products in large quantities and sell them to her customers at the normal price so she can increase her profits quickly.  Jessica has come to love her job and hopes to get involved in it even more, until she can hire other people to sell one of the lines of cosmetics.

Abdukhalil is 50 years old and lives in Shahristan, Tajikistan, with his wife who helps him with household expenses. They have three children: two help with the agricultural work, and one is studying. For his family\u2019s sake he hopes to make improvements to his house that is too old.\r\n\r\nFor the past five years, Abdukhalil has worked as a farmer; he began working as a farmer with the support of his parents. The biggest difficulty that he faces is a lack of financing and the pests that affect his crop.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

However, the income from the business is not enough to sustain everyday needs. Therefore, the couple is now requesting Minerva's tenth loan in the amount of 35,000 pesos to use as working capital to start a fishing business as supplementary income. The loan will be used to pay for fish netting and a motor boat, and the remaining funds will be used to support the raw materials needed for her kaing business.\r\n\r\nMinerva is looking forward to increased demand for fish on the island and expects her secondary business to grow and generate enough income for her family. She dreams of sending her grandchildren to school all the way through college and for them to find stable livelihoods. Through her business success, she also dreams of building a home made of concrete for more comfortable living.\r\n\r\nMinerva C. is happily living with her five children and her 62-year-old husband Marcial, who is a fisherman and kaing maker in the province of Rizal.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":520308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

For over 20 years he has been making beautiful embroidered garments which are typical in the villages in the area.  He generally works at home at night since during the day he works for a carpenter which has allowed him to increase his income over the years.  He and his wife share the embroidery activity that has kept them united.  \r\n\r\nTheir work is based on orders constantly being placed by customers.  After a month he delivers the embroidered skirts to customers and collects payment in cash.  He admits that he is not as physically strong as he used to be and takes a little longer to finish the embroidery, but he has perfected the quality and finish and this keeps customers loyal and coming back.\r\n\r\nThis is his 8th loan through MFP.

She has run the hardware store from her home for more than 8 years.  Maria says that sales have been good due to the fact that the store is in a neighborhood that is experiencing a lot of growth, where there is a lot of construction on new houses and this generates sales because the store is fairly lucky to have the variety of merchandise that it offers.  With the loans that the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya awarded her in the past, Maria was able to buy a wider variety of merchandise to supply her business.  Nevertheless, she says that she\u2019s going through months of high sales when it comes to construction, and she plans on requesting another loan to expand her showroom, as it is quite small and it is impossible to adequately exhibit all of her merchandise.  Maria wishes that the economic situation of her country would improve, and that more jobs are created, because the high level of emigration that the country is experiencing due to the lack of work makes her very sad.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Maria tiene 39 a\u00f1os est\u00e1 casada y tiene 3 hijos, posee una ferreter\u00eda,

Susana buys bags of oranges and unripe banana from farmers in the nearby villages, stores the banana to ripe and then sells it to retailers in the local market.

She has always enjoyed making cakes and all sorts of baked goods--it is a gift, which she has been perfecting through study since she was young. Now she has 20 years of experience selling delicious appetizers, which are very popular in her neighborhood because there are so many celebrations where sweets are enjoyed. For the holidays, Lastenia happily fulfills orders, but to complete them requires more investment in the ingredients she uses. This business is very profitable because the delivery costs for social events are higher, and she can make twice as much. Lastenia hopes to become very well known for her work and open a soda fountain in her house, which is still under construction. This is her 10th loan with MFP, and she is very pleased with the work carried out within her group, which is well organized.

This is 30-year-old Aisha K. from Mbeya. She is single with two children aged 6 and 10. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans.\r\n\r\nAisha has been running a grocery business since 2006. A grocery store is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to, to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nAisha works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Aisha currently earns about $80 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase various items for her grocery store. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Aisha thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":319755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Currently, he does not have the money necessary to make such changes to his home and this is why he is requesting the loan. \r\n\r\nHe plans to repay the loan with the income from his job as an electrical technician where he works for the municipal water commission. This is the income that he has for his family because he has two teenage children who are still in school. \r\n\r\nThe person in the photograph is his wife, Lucia Martinez. She served us the day of our visit to the Baez family home. \r\n\r\nThey are grateful for the cooperation in the previous loan, which they used to make improvements to their home, because they are elderly and find it difficult to obtain credit. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":712731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to finish the roof and repair the exterior of the house.

Her story is representative of both her group and of Esperanza's Haitian (many of whom have recently immigrated to the Dominican Republic) and Dominican clients. The group is based in Los Alcarrizos, a dusty industrial town north of Santo Domingo, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable at best. Here she makes her home in a simple structure with her husband and three children.\r\n\r\nEvelis has come to Esperanza with the goal of growing her business but, also, because it is a way of development for the community. She is not only interested in the money; she cares about the community. She operates a business where she sells household and beauty products. She is associated to a franchise. She sells those products and motivates others to join and go forward. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she intends to increase her inventory. She believes that this will allow her to supply more clients (other businesses, households and salons) and to distinguish herself by always having what is needed in stock, while providing high quality products. She will use the profits to save and to address some needs in her family. In the long term she would like to continue growing her business with Esperanza to the point where she can sell more products, reach more clients, motivate others and eventually have enough profits to purchase her own home and to continuing helping her children. She especially wants to pay for their studies. Thank you so much for your support!

Apolonia D., 42, believes in this and incorporates it in her beliefs, business, and lifestyle. Apolonia finished a degree in AB Library Science in college, and is married to Nelson, a driver. She is also an active community partner of CCT*. Two children were born into their family, one is studying in elementary school and one who is not yet of school age. Their family resides in Munting Ilog, Silang, Cavite.\r\n\r\nAt present, Apolonia is focusing on growing her businesses\u2014 a public transportation business and an agricultural garden grown for profit. Each day her husband goes out to provide transportation services to people in their community. The fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants being grown in her agricultural garden are being sold in the market for profit. Apolonia has been doing this for ten years now. Every month, her perseverance yields her an average of Php11,900.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Apolonia is requesting a loan of 19,000 PHP.  She believes that this is one step to take in order for her to grow her business. She sees applying for this loan as a great help to her. With the loan money on hand, she intends to buy essential materials for her jeepney transport business. She will purchase wheels and other spare parts for the improvement and maintenance of the vehicle. Apolonia sees this loan as a great opportunity for growth, and she prays that the Lord will continually bless those people whom He uses to bless her and her family.\r\n\r\nIt becomes a real challenge to Apolonia whenever the jeepney goes under repair, since it is one of their main source of business income. But she refuses to back down and finds ways to solve the dilemma. Apolonia believes that soon, her business will grow, even the agricultural garden she grows for additional profit. Above everything else, she prays that her children will grow to become successful in completing their education. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

Since 2007, Komiljon has supported his family through his efforts. During this time he has tried various types of activities. Finally, a year ago he started his own business selling cell phones. Komiljon believes that this business is profitable and the generated income allows him to support his family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She and her little son live with her parents in their house.  For the past 2 years, she has sold shoes to her neighbors and acquaintances, and on the weekends at local markets.  When she began her business she had very few pairs of shoes to sell, but she knew to invest her earnings, and today she offers a considerably larger quantity of merchandise.  Blanca acquires her shoes in other cities, and later distributes them to her customers.  Occasionally her relatives help her with the sales, when she cannot carry the heavy packages.  For Blanca, this activity is very satisfying, both because of the money it earns, and because shoes are not perishable, and do not lose value if they are not immediately sold.  For the future, Blanca wants to have her own permanent space to sell her shoes in, so that her business could be more stable.  This is the second time that she has had a loan with MFP, and she is very certain that in this new cycle her work with the communal bank will be more satisfactory than her previous experience.  The money that she asks for will be used to purchase a greater quantity of shoes, enabling her to expand the profit margin she makes on her sales.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":309547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Incremento de su mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-27T21:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842136}],"funded_date":"2009-04-27T23:33:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":108576,"name":"Razia M.farooq Sultan Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Razia baji is a wife of M.

Martine has lived for about 48 years in the Cadjehoun area of Cotonou. Martine is married to Firmin Assogba, a mason, and she has seven children, six of whom are in her care. All of Martine's children are in school. Martine and Firmin provide for the family together. Not having gone to school, Martine began in business very early on.

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 4 years of experience in this business.    Epi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Epi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Epi's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15 \r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Epi are provided by SPBD:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:               1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates
