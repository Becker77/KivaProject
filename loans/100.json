They buy their goods either from Makeni or the other villages surrounding Makump. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the group's sixth request for a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one of them in the group received a loan of 800,000 SLL. That loan had meaningful impacts on the lives of these people. They were able to use the loans to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They were also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are now requesting a loan of about $330 (1,000,000 SLL) each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nAmidu (right) is the leader of the group. He is 60 years of age and was born in Makump village. He is married to 3 wives and they have 19 children. The eldest is 26 and the youngest is over 1 year old. His wives too are businesswomen; they joined him in the business. Amidu has been a businessman for over 30 years now.\r\n<p>\r\nAmidu sells palm kernels. He and his wives walk around the surrounding villages to search for and buy the palm kernels and then sell the palm kernels in Makeni. A pan of palm kernel costs him 1,000 SLL. With his loan, he will be able to buy 30 bags of palm kernels.  \r\n<p>\r\nAmidu and his wives faces one challenge in their palm-kernel business and it is that of transporting the kernels from the villages to Makump village. Since these are villages, there are no vehicles around to help them transport the kernels. Apart from this, Amidu is doing fine is his business and he enjoys doing it. Your loan will help boost his business, having money in his hands will make him feel good and have piece of mind.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":278101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy at least 30 bags of palm kernels","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-02-25T17:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amidu ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabinty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamusu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":165.62,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-17T07:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":505143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434539},{"amount":99.37,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":303085.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025737},{"amount":231.88,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":707200.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008540},{"amount":165.63,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":505143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230877},{"amount":265,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-22T11:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":808228.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102883},{"amount":132.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":404114.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019899},{"amount":132.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":404114.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864744},{"amount":132.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":404114.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754553}],"funded_date":"2009-02-25T21:46:56Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Adler","image":123557}},{"id":95586,"name":"Roberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roberto mayor de edad con 47 a\u00f1os, vive en la Avenida Florida, se encuentra casado, se dedica al servicio de transporte de pasajeros en taxi.

Vive en su casa propia junto a su esposa y sus 4 hijos. Desde ni\u00f1o se dedic\u00f3 al cultivo de papas, arvejas y en menor cantidad, de ma\u00edz. Ahora, ya de adulto, obtiene ingresos extras arando las chacras de sus vecinos con los toros de sus suegros, donde le pagan por jornada entre 50 a 60 soles dependiendo del terreno. Y de esas ganancias, a pesar que sus suegros las quieren distribuir en partes iguales, Miler s\u00f3lo les recibe la tercera parte, pues aprendi\u00f3 a ser agradecido con sus ellos, quienes reiteradamente le brindan su apoyo con sus chacras y sus toros. Por ello, ara todas las chacras de sus vecinos alegremente y en menor tiempo, por lo que tiene mayor disponibilidad para realizar otros trabajos en los cultivos de sus vecinos y cubrir los gastos de su hogar. Este es su quinto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde ha demostrado una responsabilidad digna de imitar, m\u00e1s aun cuando era el tesorero de su banco comunal, al que tiene mucho aprecio, pues todos los integrantes se llevan muy bien y le gusta ahorrar. Por todos estos motivos se siente muy feliz con su grupo y con su trabajo. El dinero que viene solicitado los piensa invertir en la compra de una bolsa de arvejas y 5 sacos de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos.","en":"Miler is 36 years old and is a very dynamic man with a good character. He lives in his own house with his wife and their 4 children. Since he was a child, he has grown potatoes, peas, and, in a smaller quantity, corn. Now, as an adult, he earns extra income by plowing his neighbors\u2019 farms with his in-laws\u2019 bulls. The activity earns him between 50 to 60 soles per day, depending on the land. From these earnings, which are distributed evenly between Miler and his in-laws, Miler only receives a third. This is because his in-laws offer him their support with their farms and their bulls. He plows all of his neighbors\u2019 farms happily and quickly, so that he is available to pursue other work with his neighbors\u2019 crops and to cover his household expenses. This is his fifth loan with MFP, where he has demonstrated a dignified responsibility. He is grateful for his community bank, where he was the treasurer. All of the members do very well and enjoy saving. For all of these reasons, he is very happy with his group and with his work. The money that he is requesting will be invested to buy a bag of peas and 5 sacks of chemical fertilizers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":368305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-12T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miler","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":138.03,"local_amount":394.37,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":405.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734226},{"amount":1.54,"local_amount":4.41,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123995},{"amount":210.43,"local_amount":601.22,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":618.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959578}],"funded_date":"2009-08-12T20:21:37Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":132481,"name":"Marizel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marizel H. is from the village of Unidos.

The business is doing well because she has regular customers. \r\n<p>\r\nAnita has been working with her Communal Bank since it started 8 years ago.  Thanks to the loan from the Foundation, she was able to excel in her business and also help her children with their education.  With this new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir, she will invest in raw materials for her business such as thread, fabric, lace, paint, wool for making sweaters, etc.  She plans to expand her business by making more home d\u00e9cor products.\r\n<p>\r\nHer biggest dream is to open a shop for her business because she currently works from home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan

This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Gloria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well eing by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Their other child is currently employed.  \r\n\r\nEmma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emma has been incrementally lifted her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to fund the business operations so that she could continue to save up for the family's needs. \r\n\r\nEmma V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

During one of the evening conversations at the family table, after a hard workday in the field, Beishekan and her husband, a tractor driver, were thinking about government regulations in the country\u2019s agriculture that would certainly affect their family, too. It was the year 1996, a period when new independent countries, including Kyrgyzstan, were privatizing land, which used to be collective farms during the Soviet Union. \r\n\r\nBeishekan saw advantages like having an opportunity to manage the business on her own behalf without participation of the government. But there were also risks of facing thorough competition and lack of experience in supplying the products. For the following fifteen years Beishekan has been running a dairy business, while her husband is most of the time in fieldwork. Several head of livestock yield up to six liters of milk daily, which Beishekan delivers immediately to local consumers for 11 soms per liter. \r\n\r\nBeishekan is also a proud mother of nine kids, most of whom already live on their own. For her the most successful accomplishment in her entire lifetime is giving her kids broader opportunities to choose who they want to be. Since agriculture is a seasonal business, during slow times the only source of income is the dairy business. Beishekan used a start-up capital of 3 000 soms. Now her business generates 2 000 soms of monthly income. The purpose of the loan is the purchase of 1 ton of potato seeds. The fieldwork season has started, so Beishekan says the seeds have to be sown as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He normally goes to buy cows at a reasonable price from people who live in the rural area at the frontier of Phnom Penh. He also fattens cows from his home and will sell them out to farmers to gain income. Another source of daily income for his family comes from his wife, who works in a garment factory.

She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Aiga has 2 years of experience in this business.  Aiga needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  Aiga T. is a strong, motivated client and wishes to have not only the ice cake busines but also a back up business to assist her with planting and elei as well.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Aiga joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Aiga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Aiga T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She runs a mixed farm near Kitale, Kenya, where she has been farming for over two years. She sells a variety of products to generate her income, including milk, vegetables, sugar cane and tomatoes. Since her husband passed on recently, Emily also receives small pension amount from his past employer which supplements her income.\r\n\r\nEmily recently completed a Kes 20,000 loan with Juhudi Kilimo, and has now requested this loan for Kes. 20,000 to purchase two goats and to improve her stock of poultry. She says that the extra income from this loan will help her attain financial independence. She currently relies on relatives at times for financial support, and she hopes that will no longer be necessary once she is able to improve her standard of living. She also wants to be in position where she can afford to educate both of her children.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Emily has numerous goals for the growth of her farm. She wants to acquire additional dairy animals and over 200 poultry layers. She also hopes to expand and plant up to five acres of

Currently they only have one daughter who is still dependent on them.  It's worth mentioning that Mrs. V. makes the majority of her sales on credit.  Almost all of her clients are employed in the tobacco factories, and they go to her because she sells them the merchandise as long as they pay her when they get their paychecks.  \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy merchandise and stock her business.

Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in daily sales.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Beverly is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nBeverly hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":855712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-28T02:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beverly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.33,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2696.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005445},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5332.98,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5391.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764614},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5333.02,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5391.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571735},{"amount":126.66,"local_amount":5334,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5392.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529285},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1347.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738506}],"funded_date":"2011-08-28T07:52:46Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":334113,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is 47 years old and married with two children ages 6 and 15.

However, they are determined to continue on, showing optimism that their situation will improve and they will provide better care for their precious daughter. Now, Katy, after partially recovering, has decided to find work to help her parents pay the bills. The costs of transportation are expensive and they have begun to dip into their savings in order to continue improving the quality of the agricultural products they sell, in order to continue to be able to provide for their young daughter. All of these issues have weighed heavily on their family, but they are determined to do whatever it takes to be able to take care of Katy. Now Salisa is asking for a loan of $275 to invest in the purchase of fertilizers for the small parcels of land that she maintains in the small orchard near their home where she grows carrots and other root vegetables. WIth your cooperation we'll be able to put a smile on the face of a mother who has sacrificed a lot to provide for her daughter."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":76661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-10-29T09:25:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eufracina Salisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-12T16:37:46Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-12-12T10:32:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96029},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-01-12T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":114510},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-02-12T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":134087},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-03-12T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":156486},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-04-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":180858},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-05-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":208439}],"funded_date":"2007-10-29T15:37:46Z","paid_date":"2008-05-12T09:10:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":25963,"name":"Ojah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ojah is36 years old and the mother of a 7-year-old daughter.

R., a single mother of a 3 year old boy, is requesting a loan of 400 soles (Peruvian currency). Her business is vegetable sales. Starting as a child she worked selling vegetables in order to support her younger sisters. Her goal is to sell vegetables in every fair. To meet this goal she needs capital, but previously no one would loan to her because she did not meet the approval requirements. When she was ill for a time, her business suffered and she had to borrow money from her neighbor at 10% interest. Finally she saw that a FINCA representative was giving out loans accompanied by business training. Says Filomena, \"From that moment FINCA trusted me, lending me the capital to grow my business. I bought embroidery  thread and now I am embroidering the petticoats local women wear under the skirts of our traditional dress; it is going very well.\"  One of Filomena's obstacles has been a year-long bout of gastritis, which severly impacted her business, but she had the support of her family and FINCA. With the loan, she is going to buy cloth with which to make aprons, since she has a small sewing machine. Through local bartering, she trades the aprons that she makes for corn and barley. She dreams of one day opening a clothing store with her own savings, and sellling wholesale. Some day she would also like to get to know the capital city of Lima, arriving there as a business woman. <p>Patricia R. R. is married with 8 children ranging in age from 12 to 22. All of her children are in school; the eldest attends the national university. She is requesting a  loan of 800 Peruvian soles. Her business is the sale of lambs; Patricia raises sheep. Before she was born her father passed away. As a result, the people of the village marginalized her. A friend took her to Lima where she got married and started a business with her husband. Unfortunately, the couple lost  everything in a robbery and had to return to her village with nothing. That's when Patricia began to raise her sheep. \"When FINCA arrived in the village the community did not support me in my application for a loan because they did not believe I would be able to repay it, but I stood my ground. In the end, FINCA loaned me the money and gave me the business training. I was able to reopen my business selling meat and free range eggs. Now that I qualify for a larger loan I would like to begin selling my meat in Lima. Thanks to FINCA and their training courses, I feel valued, and the people no longer marginalize me since I now have a stable business.\"  The loan will be invested in rams, more eggs, and cheese. Her dream is to have a butcher stand in the city of Huancavelica, and to support her son in the university, in the hope that he will later be able to support his younger siblings, so that they, too, may go on to be professionals.<p>Maria C. R., single mother of a 4 year old son, is taking out  a loan of 800 Peruvian soles. She sells potatoes, and has now started a business making embroidered petticoats. \"In the beginning I did not want to walk into the training meetings; I didn't say a word in them. Now I am very talkative.\" Maria is the local president of the Glass of Milk program, a national social program providing basic and much-needed nutrition to the poor. Her leadership of that program demonstrates that she knows how to value herself as a woman. Now, she says,  people say that she is an entrepreneur, thanks to God, because FINCA trusted her. Maria overcame a difficult obstacle in life: the father of her son left her, leaving her with only the support of an aunt. With the loan from FINCA she will buy an embroidery frame and perhaps hire an assistant. She dreams of owning her own embroidery business, which she will call \"El Resplandor\" ( perhaps  \"The Glow\" or \"The Gleam\" in English). <p><p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n<p>El Bancomunal  Ccatarisun Llaqta perteneciente al Distrito D.

She sold fried food with rice and beans.  \r\n\r\nWhen she was 13, Mariama moved to Cotonou, and in addition to selling rice, branched out into selling fermented cornmeal mush, accompanied by a variety of sauces.  She is requesting her third loan to increase her working capital in order to build up her business.  Mariama intends to stock up on sacks of rice and corn.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":254336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of one sack of rice and one sack of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-01-12T16:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":13446.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357902},{"amount":67.69,"local_amount":32000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":33098.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046952},{"amount":14.8,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7240.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938563},{"amount":12.69,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6205.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396213},{"amount":42.31,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":20686.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904095},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":13446.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126113},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":13446.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549540},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":13446.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983330},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":13446.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96895710}],"funded_date":"2009-01-12T18:13:47Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T12:12:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":87426,"name":"Phann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"C. was born 1973 and lives with five other family members in a small family home in the Pursat Province.

a boy who is two months old. Philip's wife owns a small kiosk in which she sells vegetables in the Nyalanda slum, where they live. \r\n\r\n<P>Philip drives a piki-piki, or motorcycle, which he shares with his brother. He is asking for a loan to purchase his own piki-piki so he can increase his income. For a ride of about 4 kilometers, he charges around 50 shillings (64 cents US). He says times are difficult because his wife is unable to sell as many vegetables as she used to, so he is supporting most of the family. Philip says he spends his free time on Sundays at church.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Philip recently joined the K-MET volunteer community health worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW, he will be trained by K-MET and will visit members of his community who are sick with a variety of illnesses. His volunteering will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care.<\/P>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":318139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

For about six years the family has lived together in the Dogoudo area of the town of Allada, in the Atlantique department. The couple shares the family expenses. Anne-Marie stopped going to school at the secondary level. Three years ago Anne-Marie began selling rice and bissap juice (a hibiscus flower drink). She also sells coolers (ice chests). Anne-Marie gets her supplies in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Anne-Marie has already received two loans through Alid\u00e9 which have both been paid back. Anne-Marie would like to build up her business and better serve her customers, which would permit her to increase her income.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Tautala has 3 years of experience in this business.  Tautala needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Tautala joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tautala's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Tautala H. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Three times a week, she goes to the wholesale market in her city to buy potatoes which she then sells to local retail stores.  The work starts early because there is a lot of competition and retailers only buy in the early morning.  Other days she works caring for her potato crop, work for which she can count on her family to help since they all want to get ahead.  For the future, she is planning on planting more potatoes so that she can increase her production and, in turn, her earnings.  \r\n\r\nThis is Magdalena's fifth MFP loan and she is very grateful to everyone who has made it possible for her to continue her business.  She will use the loan to buy manure and fertilizer to prepare her land for the next planting.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":527885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy supplies for farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-23T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3005.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588054}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T00:33:18Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":198895,"name":"Ezekiel Tallam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ezekiel is 60 years old and is married to Kobilo C..

She lives in Purok Dalisay, Brgy Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\n By working hard in her food vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000.  Juliet is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can purchase raw materials.  This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nJuliet aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  Her photo was taken during the center meeting because all of her food was already sold out.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 42 years old, is married and has 4 children who are 16 years old, 12, 7 and 18 months. She lives with them and her husband in the Calpules Community. She learned to sew clothing in school. She works alone and has many years of sewing experience which allows her to make any type of garment that her clients ask for. \n\nShe doesn't have a fixed work schedule, since this depends a lot on the amount of orders that she has. Her main clients are her neighbors. With this loan she will purchase cloth, interlining, decorations, elastic, thread, buttons and zippers, among other things. With this loan she will be able to offer her clients a larger variety of fabrics and and is hopeful that her increased income will allow her to better help her husband pay for their children's student fees. \n\nEach day her biggest challenge is to take care of her youngest child while also working. Her goal is to get ahead and he able to help her children finish their studies. Juana has been a FAMA client for several loan cycles and has always paid her loans back on time. \n\nTranslated from Spanish:\n\nJuana Francisca, es miembro del Banco Comunal Unido, tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene 4 hijos entre las edades de 16, 12, 7 y 1 a\u00f1o y medio, y junto a ellos y a su esposo reside en la Comunidad de Calpules. Ella aprendi\u00f3 a confeccionar ropa en una escuela donde ense\u00f1an a costurar. Las confecciones las realiza sola y tiene muchos a\u00f1os de experiencia costurando y eso le permite elaborar casi cualquier tipo de moda que le soliciten sus clientes y clientas. \n\nNo tiene un horario fijo de trabajo, ya que eso depende mucho de la cantidad de encargos que tenga, y su principal clientela son sus vecinos. El pr\u00e9stamo que solicita lo necesita para comprar telas, entretelas, adornos, el\u00e1sticos, hilos, botones, zippers, etc. Con la ayuda de este pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 ofrecer a sus clientes y clientas mayor variedad de telas y con esto espera que sus ingresos mejoren para poder ayudar a su esposo a cubrir los gastos estudiantiles de sus hijos. \n\nCada d\u00eda su gran desaf\u00edo es cuidar a su hijo de 1 a\u00f1o y medio, al mismo tiempo que trabaja. Su meta es superarse y poder ayudar a sus  hijos a culminar sus estudios. Juana es clienta de FAMA desde hace varios ciclos y ha cancelado sus cuotas de forma puntual.

She still lives here with her husband and 4 kids. For the past few years, she has had to take become the mainstay of the family's economic survival, as her husband hasn't had a steady job for quite some time! Occasionally he works as a hired hand in agricultural duties (the area has a lot of cocoa farming, and there's a need for laborers at the time of hand-picking of this precious fruit! He now works assisting her in her clothing sales, by delivering the goods and doing some collections himself! \r\n\r\nThe clothing Antonia sells comes from \u201cpacas\u201d (or packs of pressed new and used clothing which Dominicans can buy from donations to the poor on the Haitian side of the island, which the people bring over to the Dominican Republic in order to sell them and thus, be able buy food and groceries). \u201cPacas\u201d come in at least three types: Type A, B and C. Type A packs are mostly of \u201cpremium\u201d goods, as they contain new items, often from signature brands, and which command a \u2018premium\u2019 price, for obvious reasons. On type A\u2019s (worth between USD$300 to $400) there is more income to be made, as they can be sold to a higher income bracket customer. However, Antonia tells us thus far she has only been able to buy type B \u201cpacas\u201d (worth some USD$250 to $300 mainly dependent upon the composition and proportion of the new\/used portions of clothing to be found on them) which is obviously of a lower quality from those on the type A group. Finally the type C \u201cpacas\u201d (costing anywhere from USD$100 to $250, each) are the cheapest, obviously consisting of used clothing or new of lower quality. \u201cPaca\u201d buyers must trust their intermediaries, as the insides are not able to be seen until the packs are opened. Normally the \u201cpacas\u201d are opened and sold on a piece by piece fashion, which will bring the largest return on the sales. However, those go to the Haiti-Dominican Rep. border in order to buy the \u201cpacas\u201d, as Antonia does, can buy them at lower prices than those that might be found in or near the cities, such as Santo Domingo. The trip to the border costs somewhere in the neighborhood of USD$25-30 each way, expensive, but there\u2019s no other way\u2026 Of course, both the sacrifice as well as the cost is recuperated a few times over, once the \u201cpaca\u201d buyer has been able to do the purchasing and transportation to the end market\u2019s territory. The unopened \u201cpacas\u201d can command up to three times the value over their original cost once brought into the final market areas, as the owner\/buyer is able to maintain the quality standards customary to their customers. But most prefer to have the larger income product, which may be brought in selling them piecemeal! \r\n\r\nAntonia wishes to be able to have her kids grow, become good citizens and show their love for the country! This she plans making via sufficient income in order to be able to pay for their transportation, and daily needs with school. She\u2019s never had a type A \u201cpack\u201d, as she\u2019s only been able to pay for a maximum of the \u201cB\u2019s\u201d value. Eventually, she\u2019ll be able to buy the As type, as she\u2019ll receive more good and larger loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":62733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Antonia will now be able to buy more \"pacas\" which she expects to need on a weekly basis, as opposed to her now bi-weekly capability.

Their mother is a role model of valor and committment.<p>\r\n\r\nThe money requested will be used to purchase stock for the restarurant such as: soft drinks, beer, ciders, wine, ice cream, and

She applied for this loan to buy one piglet for fattening and to buy assorted ingredients such as milk, gelatin, peanuts, bananas, refined sugar, ice cubes and others to make \"halo-halo\" (or mixed fruits with shredded ice cubes), which is in demand in their place during summer. \r\nShe dreams of expanding her pigpen in the future, to raise more pigs.

But now that costs of farm inputs (fertilizers, etc.) have gone up and the price of sugar has plummeted, many farmers are diversifying to crops that have a faster turnover. This is why Concepcion and her family grow vegetables: namely, so that they will have a regular cash flow which can better support their daily needs.\r\n\r\nFor her 14th loan cycle from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Concepcion is borrowing PHP 19,500 to purchase fertilizer to sustain the viability of her small farm.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

With the profits from her business over the years, Maria has been able to construct her own home from cement block, a significant improvement over the typical local home. \r\n\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza. She plans to use the loan to purchase rice, beans, oil, and other staple foods for her small colmado, or general store. She came to Esperanza because she likes the borrowing model based on holistic development. Maria not only receives loans, but also savings and health services for her family, among other things. She hopes that with the profits from this loan, she will move closer to her dream of sending her children to college. With your help, Maria can reach that goal.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Koreti has 5 years of experience in this business.  Koreti needs a loan of WST $800 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Koreti joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Koreti's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Koreti P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Their main businesses are: the sale of vegetables, female undergarments, new and used clothing; the production and sale of pastries, fast foods, meals, and tailoring bed sheets. \r\nRosa is the president of this group and in the photo she is seen sitting down in the first row from left to right. She cooks and sells bakery goods, like pastries and \u201ckuchen\u201d (pies), twice a week at a fair near her house. She makes made-to-order cakes and other products in her house. She also sells artisan ice cream on cones, and she tailors clothes in her house every day of the week. Finally, using her industrial oven that she bought with the other loans from Fondo Esperanza, she makes and sells empanadas (meat-filled pastries) and sometimes pollo asado (grilled chicken). \r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy chickens to make asados and to prepare meal plates to sell in the fair. With the loans she received from FE as well as from the industrial oven, Rosa acquired a freezer for her ice creams and a refrigerator for her mother\u2019s house, where she lives with her two children ages 13 and 7. They, together with her 21 year old son (who is in a drug rehabilitation facility) are her motivations for pushing forward with her business. Rosa receives only a tiny bit of economic help from the father of one of her children. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to own a bakery where she can sell baked goods, grilled chicken and ice creams in a part of her own house that she will  get subsidized at the end of next year.\r\n\r\nRosa has very much enjoyed working with Fondo Esperanza, for the good attention she has received from the loan officer and for the quick disbursement of her loans. She also thanks the politeness of the administration of her business.\r\n\r\nLa Cisterna is a community in Santiago, located in the \u201ccentro-sur\u201d (south central) sector of the Chilean capital, and inside of a completely urban zone.

She is a therapist\/masseuse and a retailer of various products, and found success in both fields. Gemma raised her 2 kids alone.  She works hard to meet their family needs.  They presently live in Habitat, Baseco Port Area, Manila.\r\n\r\nBeing in the business of selling food to supplement her income, Gemma has developed the skills to choose quality products and deal with people in the neighborhood to turn them into regular customers. She also sells these items to her massage customers.   Her regular customers are her neighbors, the community, and other business connections. Monthly, she earns an average net income of Php11,800.  \r\n\r\nGemma wants to maximize her potential as a multitasking entrepreneur. To help her do that and grow her businesses, she is requesting a loan of Php10,000. She plans to use this fund to increase the number of products she sells in order to better meet the specific needs of her regular customers. \r\n\r\nSure enough, Gemma has her share of customers who do not pay on time. Nevertheless, she still prays for the ability to collect their payments.

living in the village of Frunze (in northeastern Kyrgyzstan). He is married, and raising three children: 16, 13 and 8 years old. Since 1991, Janybek's family has been successfully raising lifestock, and selling farm products. They especially focus on growing apples and pears, as well as processing wheat. Now, Janybek has 3 cows, 2 horses and 10 sheep. Janybek's perseverance and hard work has allowed him to cover his family's expenses and save for his children's post-high-school education. To further increase the number of animals at his farm, Janybek is turning to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS, to purchase additional animals to fatten for market. Janybek plans to use the money he makes on improvements on the barn, to ensure good living conditions for his livestock.

Made Rai's work is good and strong, so that within a short time he had many customers. However after the incidents in East Timor, Made Rai and family immigrated back to his birth village, Blimbingsari. Made Rai did not want his unfortunate situation to haunt him. Made Rai raised and worked for his family's well being. In this village Made Rai started from scratch again. Because of his deep expertise, and his satisfactory work, Made Rai immediately has again many customers. Because of the many orders he has to fulfill, often Made Rai has no capital left to buy raw materials, like iron, and other welding equipments. From Dinari's loan, Made Rai would buy raw materails and other welding equipments, so that all his customers orders could be finished on time.

Karena Made Rai lulusan STM Teknik, pekerjaan ini dilakukannya dengan tekun dan disiplin, disamping sudah menjadi keahlian dan hobinya.

He lives in a monogamous family with his wife and children in Noumousso, a district of Kadiolo (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  At a young age, he learned commerce along with agriculture, which he practiced with his parents as his first job.  For seven years now, the trend has been inverted.  In his shop located along the main road, he now sells grain and various other goods, in the Noumousso district of the city of Kadiolo, where he enjoys unprecedented fame.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe has been in collaboration with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso for two years and is on his fourth individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been settled.  With this loan, he plans to buy 5 sacks of sugar, 10 sacks of rice, 2 sacks of beans, 5 drums (20 liters each) of cooking oil, and 30 sacks of corn.

In her work she must go house to house to visit her customers to gather her orders.  She does this to reach her monthly sales\u2019 goal.\r\n\r\nKenelma is very happy.  Thanks to this work, along with her husband\u2019s work, she has been able to generate the enough income for the family\u2019s necessities.  Also, this work does not take too much time.  Thanks to her charm and joviality when selling, she has won a good number of regular customers.  She usually gives them credit based on their demonstrated responsibility about paying.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to have a clothing store where she could also sell a variety of perfumes and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nShe has had six loans with MFP. She likes being part of her community bank because in her years of working (3) in a supportive manner, they understand each other very well and are responsible about their payments.  The loan she is now asking for is to buy more beauty products and a display case.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":326955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise and disply case","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-02T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenelma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":91.4},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":94.93},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":96.92},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":101.49},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":105.69},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":109.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.47},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.47,"local_amount":91.4,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990649},{"amount":31.64,"local_amount":94.93,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":95.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211760},{"amount":32.31,"local_amount":96.92,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":97.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641286},{"amount":33.83,"local_amount":101.49,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":102.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080724},{"amount":35.23,"local_amount":105.69,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":106.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996865},{"amount":36.52,"local_amount":109.57,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":110.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842223}],"funded_date":"2009-06-05T16:41:59Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":116130,"name":"Abdul Ahad Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

Once married, she has worked to have her own home.  She had three children and has had to support them alone because, like happens in so many families, she is a single mother.  The hardest work she's done is as a domestic where salaries are very low, work is very hard, and one is subject to many humiliations.  She lives in Managua's Laureles Sur neighborhood.  Little by little she managed to build her house, which is very unassuming, partly made of wood that is in very poor shape.  She wants to buy building materials so that she can start to improve the worst parts like the roof which needs to be replaced because in Winter it leaks.  Also, her fence has fallen and, because of lack of funds, she has been unable to repair it.  The improvements she has made have been thanks to the financing which she can repay bit by bit.  This allows her to make improvements and still be able to pay for basic needs like food and medicine (she's not insured).  She thanks Afodenic for making her home improvements possible.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She lives in her own house with her partner Bernab\u00e9 (58 years old), and her two daughters Mari Luz (28 years old) and Delia (18 years old). Although she is a bit sick from the cold of the mountains, she does not stop working because she is afraid that other merchants will take her clients.

At the same time, since she married, she has also worked in agriculture, planting potatoes, peas, corn, barley and tubers called oca and mashua( native products in the Peruvian mountains), with her husband. These activities are profitable because they allow them to cover their necessities and to buy good fields. For the future, she plans to plant, in large amounts and in addition, she wants to buy a motorized 3-wheeled vehicle in order to rent its services in the city. She also wants to increase her productivity. This is the tenth time she has had a loan with MFP and she is very calm because she says this is an opportunity to continue to grow economically. With respect to the work in her communal bank she says it is well organized. She intends to invest the money from the loan in merchandise for her cheese and corn business which is growing little by little. In addition, she will invest another part of the loan in bags of pea seeds, fertilizer and bottles of insecticide. She will also pay her workers for preparing the sown fields. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Jackson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":459478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" to buy merchandise and increase her land's productivity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-28T16:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Epifania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3024,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933887}],"funded_date":"2009-12-28T18:06:07Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Jackson","image":null}},{"id":169678,"name":"Diamante Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cDiamante\u201d  es un grupo de 7 se\u00f1oras y 1 var\u00f3n que asisten a sus reuniones en el Centro Focal \u201cExaltaci\u00f3n\u201d,  se agruparon hace poco por  la necesidad de acceder al pr\u00e9stamo ya que todas necesitan incrementar su capital de trabajo.

School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would not have been able to accomplish with their salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or to invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMariatu K. is the leader of this group of teachers. She has been a teacher for twenty years now. The 42-year-old Mariatu was born in Lunsar, a small town in northern Sierra Leone.
