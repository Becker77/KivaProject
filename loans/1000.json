Today their farm includes 3 dairy cows, a calf, a bull, 55 head of sheep and 2 horses, and the family also works 1.5 hectares of irrigated land. Their monthly income from their farm is around 15,000 KGS. For the purpose of further developing her business, Khaukharkul has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy bulls.

Salkyn is a hard-working, patient and open-hearted woman. As the main breadwinner of the family, she raises cattle and grows crops. Having started 37 years ago with a sum of only 3,000 Som (KGS), her farm now includes 3 head of cattle and 6 head of smaller livestock. The monthly income from the farm is 6,000 KGS. Salkyn has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS for the purpose of further developing her business. She plans to buy sheep to fatten and sell. Salkyn will use the income generated by this loan to further expand her business and to have the opportunity to improve her housing conditions.

Although the kiosk business has been operating successfully for 6 years, most of the profit is used to cover her children\u2019s school fees. So Dorkas wants to improve the prospects of her business by adding more stock. To enable her purchase more products such as instant noodles, cigarettes, snacks, candy, cold drinks, soap and pens, Dorkas is applying for a 3,000,000 IDR loan from TLM. She is convinced that with this loan and an improved range of products, the business income will increase to provide a stable income to cover increasing family expenditures.

He buys his supplies in the villages in Garalo and the surrounding area. The cereals are stored in his shop before being resold for cash to men and women from Sikasso and Bamako. Often, he transports the cereals to Bamako if required. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Drissa envisages earning an average of 150 000 CFA francs per month.

has used loans from Kiva several times, all the while investing in development of his greenhouse business. Last year, Pavel's father-in-law was seriously ill. The family spent a lot of money on treatment, but nothing worked and his father-in-law died. Because their money was not enough for the seeds and film for last season, Pavel took another loan from Kiva. With the money invested in his business, he was able to get free and have a good profit.  \r\n\r\nThis time Pavel needs a sum of 20,000 hrivna to buy seeds and film to organize the next greenhouse season.

Besides that, the family owns a milk cow and produces dairy products with the received milk. The income is hardly enough for food for a five member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTemuri requested a loan from Credo to start up the family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor that do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Temuri will set up his auto repair workshop in Kutaisi (the nearby town). He will rent the building and serve the local drivers. Temuri will get a service fee, and the new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She remembers the sad parting of her husband who was a big help in achieving many goals while he was at her side. She has the emotional support and the company of her son, Carlos, who is 30 years old, who has always devoted his attention to her.\r\n\r\nShe is the owner of a house made of adobe where she currently lives. She works growing cocoa and has more than thirty years experience, continuing to carry on with the same motivation, as she is always very proud of the lots she acquired days after getting married. Today, she has the support of laborers who are immediate family members and nephews, and as is known, one of the best ways to work is with people you trust.\r\n\r\nShe considers the production of cocoa one of the best ways to make a living and her land is very fertile as well as moist generating good profit in the short and long term. However, one of the grounds of constant concerns is that next to one of her plots a river circulates, as it is very beneficial to her crops.\r\n\r\nBeing in the middle stage of the maintenance of cocoa trees, she believes she should give it all her attention, because the quality of the grains will determine the marketing of it, which is why she needs sufficient organic compost as well as sufficient capital in order to contract to manage the weeding.\r\n\r\nIn the future she plans to construct a house of concrete and bricks to fulfill the urge to complete one of her dreams of a planned inheritance for her grandchildren. She has had seven loans and has a good credit history permitting her work to go smoothly. She is an attentive person at the meetings of her communal bank. With the 1,000 [soles] she will buy bags of organic compost as well as contract laborers to weed the crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1232617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She grows tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes in greenhouses.  She has four large greenhouses, as well as greenhouses for seedlings.  She has been in this line of work for about 16 years.

She has been a cacao producer for 15 years and is well-known in her area.  She counts on the help of day laborers who aid in maintaining the plants, pulling the weeds and pruning the cacao plants.  \r\nOne of the activities that she finds the most gratifying is the harvest.  That is when she can enjoy seeing the colorful cacao fruit all piled up to later be opened and put out to dry.  For Eulalia, this signifies a good production.  Recently, someone has offered to sell her a parcel of land adjacent to her own, and Eulalia doesn't want to miss out on the opportunity.  Therefore, this eighth loan with MFP would be to purchase said plot of land, on which she could expand her cacao plantings.

She lives with her partner and has two children who are 21 and 19 years old.  She is currently very happy to be expecting her third child.  She lives with her husband and their two children in their own home, which they were able to build through a lot of work.  Karina's business is selling food, local dishes and roast meats like chicken, pig and fish.  To do this, she set up a table in the front area of her house where she gives friendly and cordial service to her customers.  She has been in this business for four years, and her daughter helps her to prepare the stews and serve the customers.  The majority of her customers are her neighbors and passersby.  In addition, three months ago Karina was able to purchase a taxi, which her husband uses for work.  And so they are able to meet their household expenses.  Karina likes her business, as it affords her an income that meets the household expenses and her children's needs.  Her children are her motivation to continue progressing.  On the other hand, she doesn't like when the prices of her supplies go up, as it results in an income reduction.  But even so, she finds a way to make her sales profitable.  Karina plans to continue with her business, to maintain it and expand with more chairs and tables to give her customers greater comfort.  This is her first individual loan with MFP.  She feels grateful for the financial assistance they are offering her to keep her business going and advance her plans.  She also says that she feels very confident working with the institution, as she feels that they are offering everything she needs to be a good member.\r\nTo improve her earnings, Karina will invest the requested amount of 2500 nuevos soles (USD$975) in the whole sale purchase of the ingredients she needs to prepare her foods, like rice, cooking oils, potatoes and other items. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1232730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, cooking oils, potatoes and other items.

She works a lot.  What she wishes for most is to be able to offer a better quality of life to her young daughter and to strengthen herself economically.   Consuelo makes a living selling chickens.  \r\n\r\nShe has a stall in one of the busiest markets.  Fortunately, she has good sales and considerable profits since her work place is well-located on a corner quite visible to the street.  But this work takes a lot of sacrifice in order to obtain good and fresh products that she offers to her customers.  She has to wake up at dawn to go to the chicken supplier to get ahead of other sellers that compete in her same area.  \r\n\r\nShe knows that all her effort is worth the difficulty and is rewarded to see that her small daughter has everything necessary to be comfortable.  She has been working in this business for more than four years.  She works alone and says that her desire to do things well and to generate economic income for her family are her main motives to go in search of further progress.\r\n\r\nShe likes the freedom that this work offers her; she can have fun during the afternoons, playing and practicing sports, and being with her family.  She hopes to continue working in order to continue growing her business.  \r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP.  She was always a good member within her group, where they loved her for being very responsible and supportive.  She is thankful to those that have offered her the loan she requires to continue growing her business.  She is convinced that she will continue to be a very punctual client and she will pay her installments on time, like she has done with all the other loans she has had so far.\r\n\r\nThe amount she is requesting (3500 PEN) she will invest in buying more chickens of the best species and sizes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1232738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens.

She has her small business set up in her own home. She devotes herself full-time to carrying out this function and is quite satisfied with her sales. She works alone while also taking care of basic tasks in her home. She stocks her business on a weekly basis, making her purchases in the downtown shopping centers of the city with the help of her son. She has been doing this work for five years. What she likes about her work is that she produces financial income without this demanding an excessive effort from her. Additionally she has time to be able to help her little grandson with his homework from school. It's going well for her since she has good earnings that allow her to make her payments on time. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to be able to expand her business and start to save up in order to invest in some improvements to her living conditions in the future.

She has a workshop in her house and has been doing this work for 20 years. everything she knows she learned from working since she was very young. Little by little and with a lot of patience she learned about the techniques of sewing and decided to generate her own income but putting into practice what she knew how to do best. She also has entered into the business of buying and selling lumber due to the profitability that that sector generates. She works with her son in law's help. He knows about the development of this activity more than she does. Meanwhile. during the time that she does her sewing work she is always working for the best way to do the work since many times the pressure from the customers made her feel like she wasn't going to be able to complete her tasks efficiently. Nonetheless, she faces the adversity and now she has plans to expand her business. She knows that the way to do it is long and at this time she wants to keep it as a long term goal. Now she will prepare to sew her own designs and sell them, since she already has orders from her customers. This is her third individual loan with the MFP institution. She is grateful to all of the people who are making her loan possible so she can continue with her programmed objectives and growth.

consumption. She has three children and has been doing this work for four years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, job salary, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"Apart from providing food for the family, it provides income too.\" She describes her biggest challenge: \"During planting season the price of inputs is high.\" Animals on the farm have been given the names of Grace and Serey. She will use the loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nMaria was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"It is the only microfinance institution providing asset finance to farmers in my area.\" This client was also asked what she learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session. She replied, \"To invest productive assets.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

She works at the business 9 hours per day and 7 days per week. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking her first loan, in the amount of Le 800000, so that she can purchase more food like palm oil, rice, and pepper for resale. The anticipated profit she expects to generate from the loan will be used to pay school fees for her child. Her dream is to improve her family's living conditions. In the future, she plans to own a residential plot of land. \r\n\r\nFatmata thanks you for your

She devotes all her love and effort to her 5 year old son, Marco. Her partner, Filomeno, has been her unconditional, life-long support. They live in a wooden house where they plan to lay concrete in the future. Because of a bad moment she went through once, she decided to seek for a economic activity. She moved to the jungle and, using a lot inherited from her parents, she was able to grow coffee and consolidate her business with her husband's support. One of her favorite things about her activity is to see how her lots become increasingly productive and how the coffee beans are well paid by the buyers in bulk to which she sells her products.

He lives with his wife and three children.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Mounir started his own business as a fisherman. It was a hobby that turned into a profession, which can return on him with higher revenue. In parallel, he works as a farmer; his job consists of cultivating vegetables.

This group was formed in the year 2008 by four women members of the Below Poverty Line category from the village Torli in the district of Nuapada in Odisha, India. Nuapada district is one of the poorest districts in India. \n\nSantoshini is one of the members of this group. She is standing second from left in the photo. She is very shy by nature but has a strong determination for the development of her family. She is 35 years old, living with her husband, one baby son and three daughters, ages 10, 7 and 3 years old. Her two daughters are attending school in the same village. She has a little patch of land where her husband cultivates vegetables. \n\nSantoshini is running a milk business with three cows. She purchased two cows \u2013 one from each of two previous loans from Mahashakti Foundation. Santoshini is getting 15 liters of milk per day. Her husband supplies this milk to a Tiffin hotel in a nearby town. Her family earns 5,000 Indian rupees (INR) per month from the present milk business. To maintain a family of six members along with maintenance of the cows, the present income is insufficient, and Santoshini is facing lots of financial trouble. So, as there is growing demand for milk in the locality, she has planned to utilize the present loan for purchasing another cow of improved variety to add some extra income for her family. \n\nSantoshini is very much thankful to Mahashakti Foundation for her growth. She says this will help her to earn some extra income and save some money to provide better education for her children. Santoshini also has a dream of developing a dairy farm in the future and constructing a cow shed.\n\nThe other three members of this group are Sabitri, Sabita and Lochana. They run a cloth business, electrical motor winding center and grocery shop.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing a cow of improved variety.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Torli,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-12T11:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-12T11:10:02Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santoshini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lochana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":104000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":104000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T01:48:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":491405,"name":"Rosalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalyn is a 27-year-old married woman from Albur, Bohol.

Currently 29 years old, Adrian grew tired of the restaurant industry and decided he needed a career change.\r\n\r\nIn May 2012, Adrian entered the carpet cleaning industry. He says his family has always been in this industry. His grandpa and two of his uncles had different businesses in the field, so since he was a child, he has always been around it, learning everything he needs to do a good job. \r\n\r\nAt Deep Clean Carpet Cleaners, located in his hometown of El Paso, Adrian says, \u201cWe do the best service at the best price.\u201d \r\n\r\nThat service consists of not just carpet cleaning, but car interior and upholstery cleaning as well. He says his customer service, performance and chemicals and machine used set him apart from competitors. Adrian uses a truck mount, which is a carpet cleaning machine that uses hypoallergenic, biodegradable enzymes instead of shampoos to clean and also extracts water. \r\n\r\nAfter visiting the El Paso Small Business Development Center for business support, Adrian was introduced to Accion Texas Inc., then decided to apply for a loan with Accion. Upon approval, Adrian purchased a Prochem truck mount, which he says will help the vitality of his business as it will do a better job. Because of the loan, Adrian said, \u201cI\u2019m ready to compete with major companies at a local price.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy next year, Adrian expects to have a second cleaning unit and create jobs for at least two employees, but for the time being, he works alone.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5600,"image":{"id":1233407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Auto Insurance, an independent company that works with unlicensed and international-licensed drivers with not-so-perfect credit and\/or driving records. Community Auto Insurance also provides notary public services, Spanish translations and income tax preparation. \u201cI\u2019m here to service my community and help them in any way I can,\u201d he says. \r\n\r\nThough Cesar currently works alone at his office in Garland, Texas, he plans to hire a staff to meet higher demand during the tax and insurance season. He says once people receive their income tax refunds, many tend to purchase cars, which leads to an increase in the purchase of auto insurance policies. \r\n\r\nBefore he entered the insurance industry five years ago, Cesar had a lot of friends who were already insurance agents, and from their stories, he found there is a large profit margin as an independent insurance broker, or a third-party insurance agent, who works with multiple insurance companies to offer the best policy and price for his customers.  \r\n\r\n\u201cI always knew there was money to be made,\u201d he says. \u201cI just had to wait for the right time.\u201d \r\n\r\nBefore going on his own, Cesar was laid off from a full-time job when his employer decided to downsize the company and invest in a management system. He says he was \u201calmost forced\u201d into becoming an entrepreneur. Cesar says losing his job coincided with his discovery of Accion Texas Inc. during a Google search. This ultimately led to making a decision to pursue his dream of self-employment as an insurance broker.  \r\n\r\nHe applied for a loan and was approved. \u201cThe dream of opening my own industry has been one for three years,\u201d he says. \u201cI submitted my goals to banks for the last three years. No one but Accion would help.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe loan provided immediate funds to start the business. Without a loan, Cesar says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I couldn\u2019t start it, but it would have been slow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Accion loan went to start-up costs, Cesar says. Those included renovating a store front, advertising, office furniture, insurance, purchasing a printer and computer equipped with software for tax, policy management and competitive insurance rating, notary public applications, and store signs.  He has five clients and is positioned for substantial growth in the near future.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Cesar\u2019s business, visit his website at: www.communityautoinsurance.org.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7950,"image":{"id":1233453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To renovate his office, advertise the business and purchase supplies.

This type of project has a good demand from customers in the area where he lives, and the price of these used radios is affordable and acceptable to his customers. \r\n\r\nTaking this loan will meet

She started selling cosmetics and perfumes six months ago to help her husband in covering most of their expenses, and to spend her free time in a useful and productive way since her husband is working abroad to cover his family's expenses. Samira's customers like her good prices and products, in addition to her good customer service. Samira has a very good reputation. She holds the responsibility of raising and taking care of her children alone since her husband isn't available most of the time.\r\n\r\nSamira's requested loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua will be invested in buying a new cosmetics and perfume collection, to increase her income and to ensure a better source of living for her children.\r\n\r\nFatima is a 25-year-old single woman seated on the right. She works as a hair dresser, and is willing to start selling cosmetics through the applied-for loan to increase her income. Nisrine is the one seated on the left. She is a 36-year-old divorced woman and mother of an 8-year-old boy (Reda). She sacrifices her whole life to provide him with everything he might need, and to make sure that he is having a happy childhood. Nisrine is managing to be his mother and father at the same time. She provides him with the care and love of a mother, and the guidance and full responsibility of a father. For the past 11 years, she has owned an international and local call center. She is also improving and developing another business that has to do with facial treatments. That's why her applied-for loan will be invested in the beauty business she is running through increasing the masks and creams requested.\r\n\r\nThe three ladies are Al Majmoua borrowers for two cycles, and they are very pleased with what they have.

Sopio requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up but without success.  Her loan request was rejected because of low income and the family's poor living conditions.  The family runs a small-scale agricultural business.  They grow different kinds of vegetables on a family-owned plot of land.  Besides that, Sopio runs a small dairy farm of a calf and two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products, which are sold at the local open market.  In addition, Sopio works as a baker and her husband serves as a daily worker to the local farmers to earn a small monthly income.  Their income is hardly enough to feed the six-member family.  \r\n\r\nSopio requested a loan from Credo to start up a trade business.  Her loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program provides credit with soft conditions extended to the country's rural poor.  They do not have access to mainstream credit because they are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" due to low income.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Sopio will purchase different kinds of household goods and dishes at wholesale markets and sell them in her village with a price mark-up.  She will take her goods to the local houses.  In time, she will gain loyal customers and increase sales.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly increase the income of the family.  Sopio will work hard and she will be able to improve the living conditions of herself and her family members.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1231186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase household goods for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Opurchkheti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-11-12T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-12T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sopio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":67.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":72.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":97.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.3,"local_amount":67.68,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:45:19Z","rounded_local_amount":70.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331181961},{"amount":45.36,"local_amount":72.57,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":75.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565832},{"amount":46.7,"local_amount":74.72,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:22:08Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115407},{"amount":49.5,"local_amount":79.2,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":82.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860886},{"amount":49.56,"local_amount":79.3,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":82.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569693},{"amount":51.41,"local_amount":82.26,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":85.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968334},{"amount":52.56,"local_amount":84.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":87.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748764},{"amount":54.4,"local_amount":87.04,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":90.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612685},{"amount":55.75,"local_amount":89.19,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":92.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856440},{"amount":57.4,"local_amount":91.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":95.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133134},{"amount":120.06,"local_amount":192.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":199.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420106772}],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T15:31:32Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:30:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":492271,"name":"Amani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amani is a 20-year-old single woman living with her six siblings.
