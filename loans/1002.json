She is satisfied with her sales, since the business generates daily income and is profitable.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy wood, corn, corn flour, meat, cabbage, beans, oil, rice, and all the raw materials she needs to prepare the food. The loan will bring her much needed help, letting her invest, increase her production, and earn more income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe plans to air condition her house, showcase her food, and attract more steady customers. She wants to be one of the area\u00b4s best merchants so that she can increase her profits and give her children a better education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1232808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood, corn, corn flour, meat, cabbage, beans, oil, rice, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-11-13T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-13T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candida Rosa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":38.89,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":38.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048994},{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":38.89,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":38.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332006152},{"amount":272.22,"local_amount":272.22,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":272.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531170}],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T12:18:24Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:37:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":495072,"name":"Muwanguzi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muwanguzi lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She is a responsible and driven woman who lives with her partner, Jimy, and their two sons Jim (5 years old) and Jhosua (11 months old).  Liliana and Jimy are a hardworking couple with dreams of building their own house out of good material. At the moment, they live in a house made of adobe. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago, Liliana made a business proposal to Jimy, who has worked as a mechanic for many years, that the couple work together to start a business selling spare parts and doing auto repairs. So the couple decided to start their business as a team. Since then, they have united their services and been successful, thanks to the growth in the number of cars in their area as well as the good references Jimy carried with him into this business. Liliana is confident that their business will continue growing and with time, will expand in a way that will allow them to build their house and open a branch there. The key in this moment is for Liliana to keep her store well-stocked with all of the equipment necessary for Jimy to continue doing repairs. \r\n\r\nThis is Liliana's fourth loan with MFP. Because of her punctuality, she has earned the bank's trust as a borrower. Liliana is very grateful to the other members of her community bank because they are very optimistic and organized workers. With the 4,000 soles from this loan, Liliana will buy spare auto parts at wholesale as well as some tools to use for vehicle repairs in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1232150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"comprar repuestos y herramientas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-13T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-13T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":443.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":437.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":482.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":498.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":514.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":517.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":548.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":557.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":341.59,"local_amount":881.53,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":890.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188796},{"amount":186.85,"local_amount":482.19,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":486.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572696},{"amount":193,"local_amount":498.06,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":502.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122362},{"amount":199.35,"local_amount":514.45,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":519.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868180},{"amount":200.62,"local_amount":517.74,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":522.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577000},{"amount":212.51,"local_amount":548.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":553.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529324},{"amount":216.08,"local_amount":557.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":563.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974451}],"funded_date":"2012-12-13T21:40:08Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":495075,"name":"Prossy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Prossy  lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She is 46 years old and lives with her husband and five children (three daughters and two sons) in a rented house. Her husband is engaged in a timber business in small holdings. In order to supplement the family income and before the group came into existence, she did weaving and sold vegetables. Having to take care of the children in addition to the household chores, she found it difficult to continue her weaving and selling vegetables activities.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan and support from her family members, she partitioned and extended their sitting room into a tea hotel. With good faith, she asked her landlord to allow her to construct a fireplace, which is required for a tea stall. Improving steadily in due course, her tea stall has become a common place to entertain for the young and old. She serves tea, puri and a variety of traditional items with many delicacies made from rice grain.\r\n \r\nShe wants a nursing career for her daughters and she wants the boys to choose the military as their career. She plans to enroll her eldest daughter who is now 20 years old, in a reputable nursing school. She also longs to have a home of her own and she, along with her husband, needs to save for a couple of years more to buy a housing plot and build a house.   \r\n   \r\nShe is requesting another loan to renovate her tea stall. She plans to use the loan to stock milk powder, sugar and tea leaves and spend the remainder to increase her stock of charcoal and firewood, both used for cooking purposes.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, she joined the group of five like- minded tribal women from Churachanpur, in the state of Manipur, which is in the northeastern part of India and called the group SARON. They guide and help one another to empower themselves undertaking different means of generating incomes.\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members are making steady improvement. They need another loan to increase their inventory as the festival season is approaching. The group members' activities include trading livestock to the butcher, selling beetle nut leaves and selling garments to wear.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1234282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy supplies for her tea stall, such as milk powder, sugar, tea leaves, charcoal and firewood for cooking purposes.

in the northeastern part of India came together to form a group called Saving Life. They guide and help one another to empower themselves in their businesses and help improve their lives. Hence, the \u201csaving life\u201d concept was born. \r\n\r\nThe one with her hand raised is Zaniang and she is the group leader. She is 43 years old and a mother of two daughters and one son. She lives in a rented room with her two children. In 2007, her husband was electrocuted and died. Since then, she has looked after her children alone and shouldered the responsibility of marrying off her eldest daughter and providing an education for the younger siblings. Her main source of income comes from working as a quarry worker. It takes at least five days to quarry sand to sell from the river bed. Life was not very easy for her until she and her friends came together to help one another\r\n.\r\nWith experience from her quarry work and her first loan of INR 5,000, she began to supply sand to contractors undertaking construction work. This was the turning point in her life. In due course, she became known to contractors of varying grades. Apart from the sand, she also supply bricks and cement as required and demanded. She is very happy that her children are attending school and hopes that they will get a white color job for their career. She also plans and wishes that someday soon she will have a house of her own.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to construct a small godown (warehouse) to stock cement. She will use the loan to buy building materials such as tin sheets, planks, nails, and waterproof wallpaper and to pay labor charges. Having said this, she plans to stock and sell cement at all times. She believes that she will do well in her business because of the good will that she already earned among the builders in and around town.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the members are also working very hard to supplement their respective family incomes. With the festival season looming ahead, they need another loan to supplement their stock in their garment sales and charcoal businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1234269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy building materials such as tin sheets, planks, nails, and water proof wall paper and to pay labor charges.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-13T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-13T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nemneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zelkhoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manvung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinglianmoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T15:11:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":495085,"name":"Rani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Rani is a 34-year-old married woman.

Juntos viven en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, su nombre es Nanegalito, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por lo que sus habitantes aprovechan la oportunidad para ofrecer tours, servicio de hospedaje, alimentaci\u00f3n, deportes naturales como cabalgatas, etc. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos. Aunque fue una zona que en el pasado no fue muy tomada en cuenta, ahora el trabajo arduo de sus habitantes ha hecho que inversionistas y comerciantes pongan toda su atenci\u00f3n en este lugar. \nFranklin aprendi\u00f3 desde ni\u00f1o a criar animales, sus padres le ense\u00f1aron con su experiencia y Franklin incursion\u00f3 en este negocio desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, el cuida a los animales y su h\u00e1bitat para luego comercializarlos en el mercado local. En el transcurso de cada d\u00eda Franklin dedica 10 horas a su negocio, otras veces m\u00e1s, pero lo importante es que en estos a\u00f1os de experiencia ha podido sustentar a su familia y tambi\u00e9n aprender m\u00e1s para poder enfrentar la competencia. Ahora ha decidido dar un gran paso de incrementar su negocio, para lo cual ha recurrido a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva le puedan otorgar un pr\u00e9stamo con el que pueda comprar m\u00e1s animales e insumos para el cuidado de \u00e9stos. El incremento en ingresos ayudar\u00e1 a que Franklin pueda darle a su familia una buena calidad de vida.","en":"Franklin is a 34 year old man, he studied through elementary school. He lives with his wife, with whom he has one daughter, Kamila, who is 4 years old. They live together in a rural parish of the city of Quito, the capital province of Ecuador. The parish is called Nanegalito, and is located north-west of the province of Pichincha, which was once home to an indigenous Ecuadorian culture. It is a place full of diverse flora and fauna, and also has rivers and waterfalls, which are sources of crystal clear water, that attract national and foreign tourists alike. For this reason the locals make the most of the opportunity by offering tours, home stays, meals, natural sports like horseback riding, etc. Another source of income generation for the area is livestock, with the production of milk and meat, as well as agriculture with the production of sugar cane, yucca, bamboo, corn, oranges, mandarins and papayas. Artisan work done by hand is also an opportunity for business in this area, in particular things made with natural products, like seeds found in the forest, are in demand.     \r\n\r\nThe local authorities have been concerned with providing adequate facilities for the more than 3,000 people who live here, to be able to have access to basic services. Even though in the past it was an area that was not paid much attention to, now the hard work that the community members have put in has attracted the interest of investors and business people.\r\n\r\nFranklin began learning how to take care of animals when he was a child. His parents taught him with their own experience, and Franklin has been involved in this type of business since he was 10 years old. He takes care of animals and their living space so that he can later sell them in the local market. Each day Franklin dedicates 10 hours to his business, and sometimes more. The most important thing is that during these years he has been able to support his family and he has also been able to continue learning which has allowed him to keep up with the competition. Now he has decided to take a big step in increasing his business, which is why he has turned to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, so that through Kiva they can grant him a loan, with which he will be able to buy more animals and supplies to be able to take care of them. The increase in income will help Franklin be able to give to his family a better quality of

Having the same economic background, they strive collectively to help one another to have a meaningful life for themselves. They live in Churachanpur in the state of Manipur, which is located in the northeastern part of India.\r\n\r\nThe one with her hand raised is Mawii, a member of Five Amigos. She is 35 years old and a mother of two daughters who are 13 and 7 years old. The younger daughter is suffering from Downs Syndrome and goes to a school arranged for such challenged ones. In 2006, her husband died in a road accident, leaving her to live a widow's life. Since then, she had been engaged in retailing businesses supplying organic and fresh vegetables and selling used clothes on the weekend. Though she may have had hard luck, she is happy that both her daughters go to school to learn. With a \u201cspecial needs\u201d daughter to take care of and the bargaining nature of the market, she could never do well with her vegetable retailing business.\r\n\r\nSo, with her first loan of INR 5,000, she changed her trade to selling army canteen products door to door. Since the products are sanctioned for the army at subsidized rates, the commission rate is higher. She supplies almost any commodity from toiletry products and appliances to consumables. At the initial stage, it took longer to dispose of the stock but now she is not only disposing of her products more quickly. She usually refills her stock two times a month.\r\n    \r\nWhen asked about her dreams and wishes, she got shy and said, \u201cMay my children flourish even if I suffer. I want for them to have a good life\u201d. Her two happy tears in her eyes said it all about her appreciation and gratitude when asked about her feelings for all the people around the world who lend money to help someone like herself.\r\n\r\nShe is doing very well with her business but she wants to own a clothing store, which will lessen the time she has to move around and enable her to be there for her daughters. She needs another loan to increase her supplies such as soap, lotion for winter, saving cream supplies for the barber shop, milk powder, tea leaves, hair gel, toothpaste and the like. She supplies these items in large quantities to the down town shops. Beside the shops, she has customers whom she supplies at their home according to their needs. \r\n \r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members are also working very hard to make the day\u2019s ends meet. Out of five members, four are widows struggling to do their best. The activities of the group members include selling vegetable at the market, selling used clothes and running a tea stall. They requested another loan to grow their business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1234314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy more soap, lotion, shaving cream milk powder, tea leaves, hair gel, toothpaste, etc to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-13T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-13T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Biaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholzanem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lianching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mawii","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khawli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T16:39:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":494797,"name":"Virgen De Fatima Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Encarnaci\u00f3n, 11 mujeres se unieron y formaron un grupo para ayudarse las unas a las otras.

She feels good about it because it has enabled her to collaborate in paying for her children\u2019s education. Fortunately, she has chosen to work with a product that is in high demand in the region and this enables her to have very good sales every day. In view of her results, she has plans to improve her sales space in order to provide better service.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan from MFP and she is grateful to all those who provide the financing that she needs in order to finalize her plans. She is committed to making her payments on time and she hopes to continue working with the communal bank she belongs to for the companionship and solidarity that the members offer one another. With the sum of S\/. 2,000 requested she will buy 250 baby chicks to start a new cycle of care as well as more nutritional feed to insure their proper growth and development. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1233953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 250 chicks and nutritional feed for her poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-13T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-13T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":312.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":303.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":330.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":332.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":355.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":365.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":121.21,"local_amount":312.81,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":316.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053840},{"amount":117.43,"local_amount":303.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":306.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188801},{"amount":128.02,"local_amount":330.38,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":334.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572701},{"amount":128.92,"local_amount":332.68,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":336.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122367},{"amount":137.6,"local_amount":355.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":359.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868185},{"amount":141.82,"local_amount":365.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":370.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577005}],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T04:41:18Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":495104,"name":"Chimera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chimera has been engaged in vegetable selling for four years.

Le gusta su negocio pues le permite tener un ingreso econ\u00f3mico con el cual solventa los gastos de su hogar, pues ha tenido muchas necesidades econ\u00f3micas por los bajos ingresos cuando su esposo trabajaba de cocinero en un restaurante particular, pero ahora se siente m\u00e1s aliviada por desarrollar en su propia casa un oficio que le sirve de mucho.

She is married to Cayo, who is a cook and they have one child, who is now an adult. She lives with her husband in their own house and they provide each other love and company. \r\n\r\nRosa sells food such as breakfasts and fixed meals. She set up her business in a spacious area of the house and there she waits on customers principally at night, however there are occasions that she serves meals in the mornings. Her customers are passersby in the area, neighbors and friends. Fortunately her establishment is very welcoming thanks to the fine seasoning of her meals. She has had this business for nearly five years. She started this adventure with her husband's help thanks to a loan that they obtained. Now they work together and always cordially care for their customers.\r\n\r\nRosa enjoys her business because it enables her to have an income to pay for household expenses since they have had many economic needs due to the low earnings her husband garnered working for a private restaurant. Now, however, she is relieved because they have developed a worthwhile job for him in their own home.\r\n\r\nThis is her 16th loan from MFP. Thus she is grateful to those who have made her access to this funding possible since she will feel more certain of progressing in her business. She is committed to making her payments on time and feels happy and supported by the members of her communal bank.  With the S\/.2,000 requested she will buy supplies and ingredients for her meals and also she will repair her space by buying ceramic tiles and paint for her walls as well as chairs and tables.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1233954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to prepare meals as well as ceramic tiles and paint, tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-14T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-14T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":312.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":303.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":330.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":332.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":355.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":365.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":121.21,"local_amount":312.81,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":316.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053841},{"amount":117.43,"local_amount":303.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":306.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188802},{"amount":128.02,"local_amount":330.38,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":334.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572702},{"amount":128.92,"local_amount":332.68,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":336.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122368},{"amount":137.6,"local_amount":355.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":359.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868186},{"amount":141.82,"local_amount":365.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":370.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577006}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T06:05:31Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":495561,"name":"Sergio","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Casado e pai de 2 filhos, 1 j\u00e1 frequenta Escola, vive na casa pr\u00f3pria com a sua fam\u00edlia e sustenta seus sobrinhos enviando dinheiro para despesas correntes.\n\n\u00c9 docente e do quadro do Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o.

She is married to Romeo, a construction foreman and is a mother to her children. Together with her husband, she manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRose operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 24,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRose hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Most of them are independent adults now. Thanks to her family\u2019s support, she owns a house made with solid materials.\r\n\r\nEight years ago, an opportunity arose to start a business. She opened a grocery store in the only spacious and inviting room in her house. With time, she decided to start selling chicharr\u00f3n [fried, crunchy meat] on the go as a complement, since it is one of the products that locals consume the most. She considers her business to be a profitable one, because many of her friends and neighbors are loyal customers. Now that the business is experiencing a good period, she wants to buy supplies for her store, as she considers that expanding her business step by step is convenient so that in the future it can become a larger, complete and well-stocked business. One of her goals for the future is to be able to improve her store\u2019s appearance and to add shelves and big showcases.\r\n\r\nThis will be her sixteenth credit. In the past, even if she faced some difficulties, she was able to pay back on time. She likes the fact that the communal bank is composed of numerous members, because collective work is comforting for her.

She will buy essential supplies such as rice, sugar and canned food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1234651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy essential supplies, such as rice, sugar and canned food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-14T11:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-14T11:50:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saturnina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":110.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":122.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":126.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":134.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":138.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":141.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":99.59,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":104.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188813},{"amount":44.38,"local_amount":110.95,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":116.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572713},{"amount":48.86,"local_amount":122.16,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":127.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122379},{"amount":50.47,"local_amount":126.18,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":131.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868197},{"amount":50.32,"local_amount":125.79,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":131.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577017},{"amount":53.79,"local_amount":134.47,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":140.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529330},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":138.9,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":145.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974457},{"amount":56.78,"local_amount":141.96,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":148.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995891}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T03:36:45Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":495248,"name":"Rosa Argentina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora ROSA ARGENTINA  es madre  soltera de cinco  hijos  y se dedica a la venta de atol y pan, desde hace once a\u00f1os con la que ha desarrollado a sus hijos.\n\nRosa inicia a preparar su riqu\u00edsimo  atol de  9:00  a 10:00 am posteriormente se traslada a venderlo a uno de los mercado de la ciudad de Le\u00f3n Nicaragua  y finaliza a las 3:00 pm,  de 4:00 a 6:00 pm se dedica  a la venta pan de forma ambulante en las calle de dicha Ciudad.\n\nUna de las necesidades que atraviesa  son  los gastos de graduaci\u00f3n y estudio universitario de su hija, debido a esto visit\u00f3 a Ceprodel para ser beneficiada con un cr\u00e9dito y as\u00ed  poder asegurarle  el futuro profesional de su hija.\n\nRosa Argentina  sue\u00f1a con la preparaci\u00f3n profesional de sus Hijos y obtener su propia vivienda ya que habita donde su Mam\u00e1.","en":"ROSA ARGENTINA  is a single mother of 5 children and sells bread and atol (a traditional corn starch based drink).

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLeyerlita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeyerlita hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

Her profits will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nEvangeline dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education by the grace of God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1053964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To pay for raw ingredients and products needed for her food stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-14T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-14T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evangeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8218.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960328},{"amount":250,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10273.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095045},{"amount":200,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8218.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484195},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4109.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036713}],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T16:09:00Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Seiji Humphries","image":null}},{"id":495251,"name":"Luis Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis Alberto de 40 anos de edad.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMaria operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not just a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMaria hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams to have a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nFedelina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFedelina hopes to expand her business and dreams to have a good life by the grace of God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1123116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-14T14:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-14T14:50:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fedelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6849.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095056},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.96,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484206},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.04,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036724},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":4166.93,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781312},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500.07,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2568.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488278}],"funded_date":"2012-12-13T01:51:30Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:50:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":495419,"name":"Annet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annet lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She is a widow and lives alone in the capital city of Georgia. Her economic activity is a newly started business, in particular, a small store where tobacco and beverages are sold.  Rita requested loan from local financial institutions for the business expansion, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected because of low income and insufficient experience in her business.\r\n\r\nRita was involved in the same type of business for eight years. She had rented a commercial place and had a grocery store. This business was recently stopped because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program provides business startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

Being a single parent, Tasleem needs to bear the expenses of her children and also of all the family members as she doesn\u2019t want to be a burden upon her parents. \r\n\r\nIn order to cater more customers, Tasleem needs to buy additional raw materials, such as spools of thread, packs of laces and buttons in various colors and designs. For this, she requested a loan of Rs. 20,000. This will help her to meet orders on time and make her customers happy and satisfied.

She is a very conscientious and hard-working woman. She is married to a kind man named Mamurchon, and they have 5 children. Her husband works at a sausage factory and earns 1,000 Tajiistan Somoni per month. For the last 20 years, Sayora has been raising cattle and growing crops. She and her husband try to provide their children with good housing and education. Their eldest son, Kodirchon, is now a first-year student at the Tajikistan State Medical University.

She will be able to sell more hens and increase the family income. With the increased profit Maia will develop the family business as well as improve their living conditions. She awaits your support\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1235053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to expand her chicken shed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ghvankiti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-11-14T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-14T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":85.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":88.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":97.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":108.08},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":111.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":116.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":119.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":123.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":127.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":131.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":140.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":144.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.6},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.84,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331181992},{"amount":52.6,"local_amount":85.88,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565863},{"amount":54.33,"local_amount":88.71,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":90.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115436},{"amount":59.56,"local_amount":97.24,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":99.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860915},{"amount":58.09,"local_amount":94.84,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":96.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569722},{"amount":61.02,"local_amount":99.63,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":101.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968364},{"amount":898.56,"local_amount":1467.03,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1494.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748790}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T00:52:08Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:49:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":495548,"name":"Kayonza Twimukye Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anna is requesting a loan to buy produce such as maize and beans to sell to her customers in the town of Kyenjojo, Uganda.

She and her husband have 2 sons. Her husband and sons work doing plastering and finishing. They renovate buildings, and whenever it is possible, they do repairs in their own house to save money, but most of the work is done by builders.

At an early age, she decided to live independently with the intent of providing her mother with all the necessary support.  She currently owns a home made of solid materials.  When she was a girl, Nelva helped her mother with all of the farm work until she became an adult.  She then inherited plots of cacao and started her work in a more proactive manner.  This is how she became a cacao producer.  Nelva has already been doing this for two years and has been able to move forward with her business.  She also has the help of day laborers.  Nelva admits that the work in the fields is very hard, especially with cacao since it requires a great deal of attention.  She finds it comforting that she is able to sell the dried kernels to traders who offer a good price.  \r\n<p>\r\nNelva has entered into the season of maintaining her farm by grafting plants, sowing her nursery, and acquiring fumigation supplies and sacks of organic compost.  This enables her to make the most of her land.  In addition, she needs to hire day laborers and must pay half their salary in advance.  \r\n<p>\r\nNelva plans to continue working with the same level of motivation and effort.  She would like to open a grocery store in the city so that her mother can have a peaceful job without having to work in the fields.  This will be her seventh loan.

He\u2019s been doing this for 8 years.  He started the business when he had to leave his salaried job; he used to work as a bodyguard and needed to find his own source of employment to be able to support his son.  He\u2019s been responsible with his previous loans; he\u2019s repaid them all in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to invest in working capital and stock up on vegetables and fruit like pumpkins, squash, chayote, bananas, watermelons, oranges, guavas, passion fruit and lemons.  In this way he\u2019ll be able to take advantage of the Christmas season when sales and profits increase.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

village where stockbreeding is the main productive activity. This is why there is a lot of milk and many dairy products, like cheese, cottage cheese and cream.\r\n\r\nMany people, original from the countryside, have been born and raised here, and they have got ahead in life through a lot of hard work, which is admirable. This is the case of Mrs. Angelita, as she is known locally in one of the neighborhoods that make part of the urban area of Achuapa.\r\n\r\nJes\u00fas de los \u00c1ngeles, 53, is a humble woman, married.

She learned to be a hardworking person already when she was a child, as her parents taught her to work the land, sow grains and milk the cows.\r\n\r\nBut she wanted to get ahead in life and her biggest dream was to be a teacher, because she loved to teach others how to read and write. This is why she moved to the urban area, to study and then work, which is how she has been able to have her own house and a decent living. Besides, she has kept her farm and her animals, because she thinks her roots are something important in her life.\r\n\r\nWith the goal to improve her quality of life, she would like to renovate her kitchen.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
