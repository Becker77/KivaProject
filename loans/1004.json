Even so, she is inconvenienced by the tardiness shown by some of her customers to whom she offers credit and who delay their payments.\n\nApproaching the month in which businesses and services have an increase in their sales, she is planning to travel personally to the capital so that she herself can select the clothing that she will sell, since she has good taste in women's clothing.\n\nAmong her long-term goals, she wants to open another store with the same items in one of the big cities in her region, with the goal of being nearer to her relatives, not neglecting her economic goals.

He is a single man who lives in a traditional family with his cousin in Sanoubougou II, a working-class district of the city of Sikasso. \r\n\r\nHaving not had the opportunity to pursue his studies, Hamidou learned early on the business of buying and selling mobile phones and accessories (skin cases, batteries, chargers, headphones, etc.) over 10 years ago. He conducts his business in his own shop at the Sikasso bus station, and his clientele consists mainly of travelers and carriers. He is in high demand due to the quality of his merchandise. \r\n\r\nEager to meet the needs of his growing customer base, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, where he has previously received five loans, all correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a sixth loan to go to Bamako to purchase 60 mobile phones of various brands, 10 boxes of skin cases, about 15 chargers, 30 packs of memory cards, 25 boxes of batteries, 15 dozen set of headphones in different styles, and an assortment of watches and belts. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to earn a monthly profit of 175,000 FCFA, which he will use primarily to help with the household expenses and to pay the interest on the loan. Any remainder will be reinvested in his activity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1235225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy mobile phones and accessories for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-16T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-16T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamidou Ousmane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103142},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243422},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339625005},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179904},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922704},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84024.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636246}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T17:23:40Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:35:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":496390,"name":"Luaao Lusia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luaao Lusia is 59 years old and married with seven children.

The family owns a 5 acre plot of land.  Together with his wife and parents Elyor grows grain crops.  He has been in this business for more then 10 years.  His caring wife helps him to run the business.  He sells the harvest directly to local residents for a lower price than at the market.  A large part of the population in this area purchases wheat, then grinds flour at the mill and bakes bread for personal use.  Elyor plans to buy livestock in order to grow his business and thereby increase his income.  He is asking for a loan of 3000 somoni for the purchase of livestock.

She previously sold fuel, but she states that the use of natural gas for vehicles was just starting to expand throughout the country.

She came from the Dominican Republic seven years ago with a clear goal of becoming a productive citizen. Her son started the Early Intervention Program at the age of two, so she needed to work in something that allowed her to be at home caring for her son.  She has always been passionate about education and knew that she wanted to do something in that field, so she decided to open a home-based daycare service. She was able to procure all the necessary licenses and the business has been in service for three years now. She currently cares for 17 kids and employs two women who help her care for the children. Magali looks after her business with passion and dedication because she wants to give the children the same quality care that she gives her own child.  Magali is also studying part-time at a local community college in the Bronx, majoring in Early Childhood Education. Her goal is to finish her studies and open a full service day care center. Magali is asking for a loan to help her buy new material and equipment for her home-based business, which will increase the quality of the service she offers. Some of the things she needs are a desktop computer to help school-age children with their homework and for her to be able to do the daily menu online; new tables, chairs and

She mostly makes tracksuits (for schools), skirts, t-shirts, blouses, wedding dresses and formal dress. She works with her daughter. She converted part of her house into a workshop and she works the hours that she has available. \r\n\r\nThe goods and supplies that she needs, such as fabric, fleece, and various accessories for sewing and dressmaking, can be found in the city of Santiago, where everything can be found for a low cost, which is therefore economically convenient.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will buy elastic, needles, fabric, fleece, pique fabric and lace.\r\n\r\nOne of Maria's goals is to have a small shop in her house, where she can include other types of goods and simultaneously carry out her sewing and dressmaking, and so generate more income and provide well for her family.  Maria lives with her daughter, who works with her in sewing and dressmaking. She dreams of having a shop where she can serve her clients in a calmer way and sell other products. \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has given her, as it has allowed her to invest in her business. She also feels very comfortable with the company of the other enterprising women of the Banco Comunal group, as they share different activities and interests. With respect to the training imparted in the meeting, she has learnt to manage her business in a better way. \r\n\r\nTalca belongs to the Maule region, located in the central zone of the country. It constitutes the administrative, economic and cultural centre of the region, being the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley. \r\n\r\nThere is a strange saying about Talca in Chile, \"Talca, Paris, London\". Some say that this saying derives from something originally said by an English person, \"Talca is like London\" because of the abundant mist that frequently covers the city in winter.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1235898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

one of the poorest districts of India, stepped out and decided to build a secure future for their families with their contributions. They formed a group named Omm Santi to avail credit from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing business. Purnimadei is the one standing second from the right with her hand raised in the photo. She is 45 years old and lives with her husband and two sons, 27 and 25 years of age, who help in her business. Purnimadei hails from a traditional cloth weaving community. For the last 40 years, she has been running a cloth weaving business with her husband. Now she has two hand looms for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from trader in a village that is 20 km away. They prepare 80 to 100 pieces from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. Purnimadei does the initial processing of the yarn to make it ready for weaving and after that, her husband and sons fit it to the hand loom and weave the sari. They only weave saris because of the demand in the market. Her family works around 8-10 hours a day and weaves one piece of sari from each hand loom. Purnimadei sells her products to the local traders on a weekly basis. She earns a monthly income of Rs.6,000, which is not sufficient to maintain her family. With the loan, she wants to buy a thread\/yarn in bulk. Purchasing more stock at a time will help her to reduce the purchasing & transportation costs of the raw materials. Purnimadei wishes to grow her business and save enough to complete the construction of her half-constructed house.\r\n\r\nSantidei, Padmabati and Somatuladei are the other members of the group and they also have cloth weaving businesses. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase thread\/yarn in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TUKLA,KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-16T20:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-16T20:30:14Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santidei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnimadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Somatuladei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":144000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":144000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T02:41:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":496449,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is from Poblacion, Baliangao.

age 37, is a dairy farmer.

Her loan requests were rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the dairy business. They have have three milk cows. Patman milks the cows, produces cheese, and sells it locally at the open market at a good price. Her mother is provided with a pension that brings them 125 Laris per month, which is not enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nPatman has requested a loan from Credo in order to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Patman will begin trading on clothing. She plans to purchase clothing in Turkey from wholesalers and sell these items among the villagers as well as in the nearby villages. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVicenta operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. She also sells RTW (ready-to-wear clothing) for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy larger quantities of ingredients, like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and other products she uses in her prepared foods business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nVicenta hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving a good life to her children, by the grace of God. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1236471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for ingredients and products she uses to prepare meals for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-16T21:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-16T21:20:14Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960377},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095099},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.04,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484249},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036763}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T23:54:44Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":496477,"name":"Phoy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phoy lives in a rural village of Kandal province\u2019s Kandal Stoeng district, in Cambodia.

The couple have five children who are 9, 8, 5, 4 and 2 years old.  They all live together in their own home which is located in an indigenous community in the central jungle.  Hermelinda works very hard.  She started working in the fields 20 years ago.  Over this long period of time, she has acquired 12 plots of land which are located in different parts of her town.  On her land she grows citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons.  She also grows coffee and annatto.  As her crops are located a fair distance from her home, she gets up very early in the morning so that she can get to them on time.\r\n\r\nHermelinda is very good at selling her produce.  For example, she harvests her coffee in the months of April, May and June; her annatto in October and November, and her oranges in December and November.  This allows her to make income for her family year round.  Her work is never ending and she is currently tending to her corn fields which she will harvest in February.  She is requesting your support to buy bags of organic fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThis is Hermelinda's fourth loan from MFP and she pledges to be punctual in making her monthly repayments as she has been in

The only source of the income for Tengiz is a small monthly salary, earned by him, working as a daily worker at the fields of local farmers. He also has chronic health problems and gets a monthly pension from the local government. It totals 270 GEL per month and it is hardly enough for food and everyday expenses. According to Credo estimations, Tengiz belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTengiz requested a loan from Credo to re-start-up a family business which had been stopped recently because of financial problems. His loan request was approved in the frames of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received loan, Tengiz will purchase a horse. He will go to the local forest and use the horse to haul wood from the forest. He will sell the wood in the village and earn income. The wood is mainly used by the village population for ovens to heat the houses and cook. He will also serve local farmers and cultivate land. \r\n\r\nTengiz hopes that the income will be enough for him and the new business initiative.

She lives with only one of them, in their own house in a native community in the central jungle.\r\n\r\nElena's a persistent woman who makes a living in agriculture alongside her partner.  \"Since I was 17 I've worked in the fields and I like my job,\" she says.  On her three plots of land she produces coffee, ginger, citrus fruits such as oranges and tangerines, and beans.  The coffee and ginger harvests are once a year, and they're profitable for her because she makes a good profit, which helps her cover her expenses, save, and invest again.  She gets enough from the citrus fruits and beans to cover her basic and daily expenses.

He has six children aged 18, 15, 12, 10, 9 and 8.  They live in their own home, located in an indigenous community in the central jungle.  Oscar is cheerful and responsible.  Ever since his wife died, he's devoted himself to the feeding and education of their children.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason that Oscar works very hard in the fields, so that he can support his large family.  He has 7 parcels of land where he grows coffee, achiote, and citrus such as oranges and limes. \r\n\r\nNow he has a whole lot that he has recently renewed, or re-planted, with coffee.  He will have to wait at least 3 years until this coffee plantation offers up its first beans.  Oscar will care for these plants with patience and dedication.\r\n\r\nThis month, he has to plant some beans and a bit of corn, which he will be able to harvest next year.  To do this, he needs support so that he can acquire sacks of organic fertilizer for these crops.  This is his 4th loan with MFP, and he promises to make his payments on time.  Also, he says that he feels very comfortable in his communal bank Productores de Inchatingari,\u201d because the members are supportive and responsible.  With the 1,500 Peruvian soles he requests, he will be able to buy 10 sacks of organic fertilizer, and he will also be able to pay farmhands to help him with this activity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1236093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy 10 sacks of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":157.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":173.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":179.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":186.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":185.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":203.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":214.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.24,"local_amount":157.15,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":157.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188848},{"amount":66.39,"local_amount":173.19,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":173.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572746},{"amount":68.87,"local_amount":179.66,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":180.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868230},{"amount":219.35,"local_amount":572.23,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":574.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529346},{"amount":78.1,"local_amount":203.72,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":204.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974467},{"amount":82.05,"local_amount":214.05,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":214.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995900}],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T05:42:41Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":496538,"name":"Clementina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clementina says that she benefited a lot from the previous loan as follows: She has increased her stock and finished paying for her child\u2019s schooling. \r\n\r\nShe is taking another loan to continue with her business, and she is happy for FSL loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1018544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy more food items to sell.

He\u2019s a very kind, hardworking and enthusiastic person who very much wants to improve.  Sadly, Boris has been unable to study business administration because he had to go to work to help out his parents who are very humble.

This will be their 4th loan. The featured member Satyabhama is the one who is standing in the front with raised hand in the photo.

Her main source of income is cloth weaving and selling. This is her traditional business. Presently she is managing her business successfully with two hand looms where she mainly weaves sari. Satyabhama and her husband do all the work jointly. Her husband brings raw materials (yarn\/thread) from a nearby town on credit basis and gives the finished products to the same merchant, which does not give expected returns. She is running in a continuous loss and facing a lot of trouble to maintain the household and cover educational and medical expenses of her family.  So she is planning to utilize the whole loan amount to purchase more stock of raw materials like yarn of her own. This will help her to arrest some unnecessary losses resulting from the credit delivery system and frequent movements to bring raw materials. \r\n\r\nSatyabhama dreams of constructing a house for her family because the present house is very congested for the family members. Jajnasini, Belmati,Sabitri and Purnami are the other four members doing cloth vending, cloth weaving, and footwear

women entrepreneurs of Tukla village under Nuapada district in Odisha, India, came out with a new venture to contribute some extra income to their family by accessing credit by forming a group in the year 2009.  Mukula is one of them who is sitting in the middle raising her hand in the photo. She is 43 years old, living with her husband and two sons aged 32 and 30 years. \r\n\r\nMukula is a very energetic and hard-working lady. Traditionally she is running a cloth weaving unit in her house. Presently she has three hand looms for weaving of saris. Mukula has engaged two skilled laborers to help her in weaving. Mukula pays Rs.100\/- as labor charges to the weavers. Her husband also weaves saris in the first half of the day and in the second half moves to different villages by bike for selling. From this business Mukula earns a net income of 6,000 INR which is not sufficient to manage her family and plan for future. Her husband brings raw materials (yarn\/thread) from a nearby town on both cash and credit basis and gives the finished products to the same merchant, which does not give fair returns. So she is planning to utilize the whole loan amount to purchase more stock of yarn. \r\n\r\nThis will help her to arrest some unnecessary expenses resulting from frequent movements to bring in raw materials. The role of Mukula in the business is to do the work of processing yarn. Mukula wants to save some money for the marriages of her two sons in the near future and construct a house. The other four members of the group are Lalita, Anjali, Kshiramati and Dhanmati who are doing jewellery-making work, general store, tailoring and cloth weaving businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing more yarn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TUKLA,KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhanmati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kshiramati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":156000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":156000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T14:42:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":496018,"name":"Gis\u00e8le Prudence","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Gis\u00e8le est une femme de 37 ans, m\u00e8re de 3 enfants dont l'age du premier est de 15 ans et du dernier de 6 ans.

He loves his family and they are his main motivation in life. He is a very kind, hard-working, and enthusiastic person, who does everything he can to support his family. Unfortunately, Eleo was not able to become a policeman as he would have liked, because he had to start working when he was very young due to financial problems which meant he had to support his mother and his younger siblings. In his free time, he likes to play football with his friends, and his partner sometimes spoils  him by making delicious Tallerines Rojos [a Peruvian spaghetti dish] because it is his favorite food. \r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Eleo works as an agricultural worker on an farm in his city. He works every day from early in the morning. He enjoys doing this work, and he is doing well; something which he believes is down to his hard work and his friendly attitude towards others.\r\n\r\nEleo is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because with their help he will be able to buy wood, iron, wire, and other materials as he would like to make a small pen to rear pigs in. In that way he will be able to continue working hard to achieve his dream of becoming a policeman and be able to move his family

He's a very honest, dedicated and hardworking person. He was born in a country area which is well known for its agrarian industries. His sons work in Russia, however, they don't have stable employment so Hotamaly can't rely on them fully for support. Therefore, he makes a living by growing crops ad raising animals, areas in which he has significant experience. Mainly, he grows wheat and barley.  His wife helps him run his business. \r\n\r\nHe uses profits from the crops to purchase cattle for cheap on the market, after which his wife fattens the cattle for a period of time and then they sell it for a high price. Hotamaly spends his income on his household in order to improve his living conditions.\r\n\r\nThis year, he planted two hectares of land with barley, but was unable to reap a good harvest due to poor weather. Therefore, he approached our organization requesting a loan to buy some cattle and expand his animal raising business. He feeds his cattle with fodder from his fields. \r\nHotamaly hopes for your help.

He considers his work to be very beneficial since the quality of cocoa that his land produces is optimal and well quoted by collectors doing their very rewarding and profitable work. However, harvesting the cocoa is almost a dilemma since his parcels are found on very uneven land. Not foreign to the planting season and maintenance of the cocoa trees, he wishes to have bags of organic fertilizer and hire workers again to remove a part of the land on his land with the objective of making them more productive.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he wishes to accumulate capital to start a grocery business to occupy his time while he waits for the periodic maintenance that his plantations require. This is his fifith loan. He is very committed to compliance and responsibility.

He lives together with his wife, 30-year-old Rosana, and they live happily together as a family alongside their two children.  For the comfort of his family, Gelacio managed to buy a house made from wood.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he was a very young boy, Gelacio was a lot of help to his parents in their many farming activities and tasks, helping them to grow a variety of produce including the most widely-grown crop in the region: cacao.  When he came of age and settled down in a formal relationship with Rosana, Gelacio started receiving his own material inheritance from his parents consisting of plots of land containing organic cacao trees.  As a result, for the past eight years he has been a large producer in his area, in common with many other local people.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Gelacio has experienced both good and bad moments.  One which particularly stands out is when his crops were attacked by a plague of insects.  On more than one occasion this has ruined his crops and forced him to completely re-new his plantings.  Gelacio is currently starting a new stage of planting new cacao trees.  At this time, he must take all necessary measures to ensure a good-quality yield.  One of his needs is to acquire sacks of organic fertilizer (bird guano).  He also needs to put to one side enough money to be able to hire day laborers who will be a great help to him in maintaining his crops and weeding around his trees.  \r\n\r\nGelacio is happy to be requesting his first loan from MFP.  He feels grateful and committed to making his repayments.  He hopes, in the future, to continue belonging to his community bank so that he can build up a good credit history which will allow him to apply for a larger loan.  He thanks his fellow bank members for the welcome they have given him.\r\n\r\nGelacio hopes to put the 500 soles together with his existing capital so that he can hire laborers and buy sacks of organic fertilizer such as bird guano."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1236194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers and buy sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gelacio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":54.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":70.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.95,"local_amount":54.88,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":57.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188855},{"amount":21.9,"local_amount":54.75,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":57.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572752},{"amount":24.11,"local_amount":60.28,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":63.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122417},{"amount":24.91,"local_amount":62.27,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":65.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868237},{"amount":25.73,"local_amount":64.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":67.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577056},{"amount":25.89,"local_amount":64.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":67.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529352},{"amount":27.42,"local_amount":68.56,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":71.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974473},{"amount":28.09,"local_amount":70.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":73.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995906}],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T16:01:46Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":496294,"name":"Ventura","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Ventura tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera, tiene dos hijas hija, reside en una comunidad del municipio de San Pedro Sula, Departamento de Cort\u00e9s.\nVentura desde hace 5 a\u00f1os que estableci\u00f3 su negocio de pulper\u00eda, vende productos de la canasta b\u00e1sica como az\u00facar, frijoles, arroz, harina, medicamentos de uso com\u00fan, golosinas, condimentos, productos de aseo, refrescos y golosinas.\nActualmente ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo por la cantidad de 5,000 Lempiras, los que piensa invertir en la compra de Carnes, granos b\u00e1sicos, embutidos, refrescos, verduras  y l\u00e1cteos.\nSu meta es poder vender mercader\u00eda en su tienda, al ofrecer otros productos su clientela aumentara al igual que sus ingresos y lograr estabilidad econ\u00f3mica.\n","en":"Ventura, age 55, is single and has two daughters.

Hace 3 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 dar un giro a su actividad econ\u00f3mica, desde entonces se dedica a la producci\u00f3n integral de cacao, opt\u00f3 por este rubro debido a ser una actividad algo mas din\u00e1mica mas no sencilla. Es poseedora de unas parcelas adquiridas a unos t\u00edos quienes en calidad de sobrina optaron por brindarle un precio nada despreciable.\nPara el desarrollo eficiente de sus actividades cuenta con el apoyo de Cayo, adicionando a ello la contrata de jornaleros con quienes viene trabajando desde su primera temporada de cultivo. Considera su trabajo muy rentable debido a ser el cacao un producto permanente y de producci\u00f3n en cantidades masivas que dejan en cada producci\u00f3n una buena rentabilidad para el sost\u00e9n familiar, no obstante el inconveniente principal que aqueja una producci\u00f3n final eficiente son el ataque de algunas plagas y malezas que se apoderan de los \u00e1rboles de cacao e impiden un normal crecimiento de los frutos haciendo de este un gran problema que la afecta no solo a ella sino tambi\u00e9n a gran parte de los agricultores de su zona.\nRequiere para la presente temporada contar con capital suficiente, que le permita invertir en la contrata de jornaleros para el deshierbo y la poda de los \u00e1rboles cuyo pago en su caso lo debe realizar de forma adelantada, adicionando a ello sacos de abono org\u00e1nico muy necesarios para garantizar una producci\u00f3n final eficiente.

They have two children, Soledad (14) and Adriel (11). They live together in a house made of bricks, where they share their life experiences. Three years ago, she decided to drastically change her line of work. Since then, she grows cocoa, an activity that is more dynamic, but not necessarily simpler. She owns several parcels of land that she bought from her uncles and aunts, who gave her a good price because she was part of the family.\r\n\r\nCayo helps her to be more efficient in her work, and in addition, she hires day laborers, with whom she has worked since the first sowing season. She thinks her business is very profitable because cocoa is a multi-season plant and can be produced in large quantities, which results in good profits for supporting her family. However, the main obstacles affecting an efficient production are plagues and weeds that take over the cocoa tree and hinder the fruit\u2019s growth. These are not only her problems; they affect most farmers in the region.\r\n\r\nShe requires now enough capital for the current season, in order to pay for the labor needed for weeding and pruning the trees, which in her case, has to be done in advance. In addition, she will buy compost, which is important in order to guarantee an efficient production. This is her seventh credit with MFP. Already from the first credit, she was able to dynamize her work by having capital available, which was of great help. She is committed to working with her communal bank and she attends all the group meetings punctually.\r\n\r\nWith the 1000 nuevos soles [PEN] she will pay the day laborers in advance for the

She is a kind, hardworking, and enthusiastic young woman with great aspirations of excelling. Unfortunately, Gloria was not able to study secretarial work, her career path of choice, because she has had to work since she was young to help support her parents. \r\n\r\nGloria comes from a very modest family that lives in another city. When she has time, Gloria likes to visit her parents and cook her favorite tallarines rojos (spaghetti with tomato sauce) for her family. \r\n\r\nFrom her own initiative and with much dedication and effort, Gloria started working in the fields of a large farm in her city. She often works 10-hour days starting very early in the morning. Gloria enjoys this work and she believes that its is going well for her thanks to her hard work and the kind way she treats others. \r\n\r\nGloria is very grateful for the support she receives from her aunt, as well as from Kiva lenders. With this loan, Gloria will pay the processing fees and legal documents for a small plot of land. Eventually, she will build her own house on this land. In the meantime, Gloria will continue working and following her dream of becoming a professional."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1236197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay the processing fees and legal documents for her land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"SANTIAGO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.160833 -72.257222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T13:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T13:40:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":71.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":73.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":87.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":94.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":98.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":103}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.15,"local_amount":65.38,"processed_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":68.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954975},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":69.39,"processed_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":72.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089433},{"amount":28.4,"local_amount":71.01,"processed_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":74.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478962},{"amount":29.59,"local_amount":73.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":77.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031637},{"amount":32.01,"local_amount":80.03,"processed_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":83.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776129},{"amount":32.16,"local_amount":80.4,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":84.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482942},{"amount":33.82,"local_amount":84.54,"processed_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":88.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372888996},{"amount":71.51,"local_amount":178.78,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:07Z","rounded_local_amount":187.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390774881},{"amount":118.6,"local_amount":296.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":310.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472925}],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T16:54:54Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:32:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":496311,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Catalogada como una mujer muy alegre y trabajadora, as\u00ed es Irene de 39 a\u00f1os, reside actualmente en la localidad de Santa Rosa regi\u00f3n de Ayacucho.

located in the city of Samana, in one of the rural areas surrounded by water of the Atlantic ocean. Many of the members are selling goods like clothing, shoes or cosmetics. Others sell seafood, run fried food stalls and other businesses. \r\n\r\nMarcelina is a married woman, mother of eight children, five of whom live together with her and their father. She said that her most difficult challenge has been to built her house, which she started and still needs to finish.

It has been in existence for 11 years now.\r\n\r\nVida is a happy and hardworking woman who is 50 years old. She is married to a 56-year-old painter and they have one child. She has been selling foodstuffs and charcoal for 5 years now. She started selling on a table; this is her first loan and she intends to gather enough capital to own a kiosk where she has all her goods secured. \r\n\r\nThis is the group's first loan and Vida is requesting a loan amount of 300 Ghana cedis to buy foodstuffs and charcoal to supply to her customers.

He's single and the father of little Diego, just three-year-old.  Luis owns a wood-frame house and currently lives in the town of Santa Rosa.  He has earned his living producing coffee and cacao for five years, and he's his own boss thanks to some parcels of land he managed to buy.  Since he was very young he has been obsessed with work and the desire to succeed.  \r\n\r\nLuis generally works alone because there's not that much land and it's easily accessible.  He likes being a farmer because he considers it honest work and a good and harmless way to make a living.  Nevertheless, he does have to deal with periods when brokers are paying low prices for his product while he hopes for better next season.  He wants to keep on working undefeated, so he needs to start out every season with seedbeds and guano fertilizer in order to produce a quality product.\r\n\r\nAmong his medium and long-term goals are, on one hand, to buy more land to expand production to a higher level, and, on the other hand, to open a grocery store in the city so he can rest a bit from farming while he's not needed on the farm.  Luis has had four loans with MFP and is really grateful for their confidence, to which he intends to respond with punctual payments.  Moreover, he completely approves of the communal bank's performance because the environment inspires collective responsibility. \r\n\r\nLuis plans to use the 3000 soles to buy organic fertilizer and coffee and cacao plants for his seedbeds.  He'll put the rest aside for a rainy day.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1236216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic fertilizer and cacao and coffee plants for his seedbed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":329.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":328.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":361.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":373.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":385.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":388.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":411.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":420.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":126.25,"local_amount":329.34,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":330.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188858},{"amount":125.93,"local_amount":328.52,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":329.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572755},{"amount":138.67,"local_amount":361.75,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":363.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122420},{"amount":143.24,"local_amount":373.66,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":375.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868240},{"amount":147.95,"local_amount":385.96,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":387.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577059},{"amount":148.89,"local_amount":388.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":389.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529355},{"amount":157.72,"local_amount":411.44,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":413.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974476},{"amount":161.35,"local_amount":420.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":422.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995909}],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T14:32:24Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":496677,"name":"Get Started Initiative Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Get Started Initiative Group is located on the outskirts of Kampala in one of the low income areas.

Their three small daughters Leonela, Ruth and In\u00e9s bring additional joy to their home and represent the motivation that every parent needs in order to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nThey currently live in a solid material house, which is rented. Her commercial strategy is to take advantage of rising opportunities and this is why two months ago she opened a grocery store with her effort and with Filem\u00f3n\u2019s and their daughters' help.\r\n\r\nShe also works in the agricultural sector, but since there is no constant demand for labor, she thought of making the most out of this situation. Her daughters take care of the store when she is working. This is a good way of taking care of the family\u2019s economy, since neighbors and friends visit the store regularly, which has resulted so far in good income. Given the good acceptance, she plans to buy more merchandise. By investing, she will be able to strengthen the store\u2019s position in the future and turn it into a good source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe plans, in the long term, to buy a vehicle in which she can transport the merchandise from the country side into the city and in that way reduce the final cost.

The majority of the resident of this village depend upon cultivation. \r\n\r\nNepura, second from right in the photo with raised hand, is one of the members of this group. She is 33 years old, living with her husband, and two daughters, age 8 and 4, in a small hut. \r\n\r\nThe prime work of Nepura is farming, from which she gets a very low income with which it is very difficult to maintain her family. So she started a milk business with the help of her husband in the year 2009 by purchasing a cow through a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Now she has two cows producing eight liters of milk per day. Nepura supplies this milk to a traditional milk-processing unit of her village at 20 INR per liter. She gets the price of milk in every 10 days. \r\n\r\nDuring off season of farming, her husband does labour work and Nepura looks after the dairy farm.\r\n\r\nAs there is growing demand for milk in the locality, Nepura has planned to use the present loan to purchase another cow of improved variety.  The future plan of Nepura is to save some money for construction of a house.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Shanti, Sukanti, Kuni and Payasini who are also doing similar milk businesses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a cow.

All the four members of this group are women from the village Kurebhana and belong to the below poverty line category. Kurebhana is a remote village in the district of Bolangir of Odisha, one of the poorest districts in India. A majority of the inhabitants of this village depend upon cultivation. In this village, almost all families are in the milk business. \r\n\r\nDukha is one of the members of Maa Santoshi group who has raised her hand second from right in the photo. She is 43 years old and is a straightforward lady, living with her husband, three sons age 24, 22 and 18 and one daughter, age 20. All her children have dropped out of school after secondary education and are helping their parents in farming. \r\n\r\nThe primary work of Dukha is farming from which she gets a low return with which it is very difficult to maintain her family. So she started a milk business for extra income with the help of her husband in the year 2009 by purchasing a cow from a loan availed from Mahashakti Foundation. Now she has three cows producing 10 liters of milk per day. \r\n\r\nDukha supplies this milk to a milk-processing unit of her village at 20 INR per liter. She gets the price of milk in every 10 days. As there is growing demand for milk in the locality, Dukha has planned to use the present loan for purchasing another cow of improved variety. Dukha has a dream to save some money for the marriages of her children and construct a house.\r\n\r\nThe other three members, Bilasini, Nalini and Anandini, are doing milk, vegetable and grocery store businesses. Since inception Dukha has been managing the group with utmost sincerity with good name and fame in her locality.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kurebhana, Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bilasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anandini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nalini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dukha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":88000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T18:32:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":496843,"name":"Rose Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose Marie is 27 years old, married with three children.

She is divorced and has young children. Her living conditions were very hard. After the divorce, she began to raise cattle and also to work as a dispatcher for the fire department.

She has a big heart and a wonderful soul and she needs your assistance, because, recently, she has experienced financial troubles. She's forty-nine years old, married and has four children. For the last ten years, she's made a living by breeding cattle and has many customers on the market. Her two oldest sons have left to find work in Russia and Mahbuba takes care of her family and business all by herself.\r\nShe would like to expand her business, but doesn't have enough capital.

Tiene la satisfacci\u00f3n de lograr contar nuevamente con la oportunidad que MFP le otorga, siendo este su octavo pr\u00e9stamo. Es una socia muy activa y participativa en los distintos temas que en ocasiones debaten en beneficio de su banco comunal.\nCon los 2,000 nuevos soles realizar\u00e1 la compra de abono org\u00e1nico consistente en guano de isla y compost reservando parte de su capital para la contrata de jornaleros.\n\n","en":"Nancy is 34 years old and is characterized by being a very cheerful and hardworking person. She lives an independent life and is a single mother of two daughters who are her reason for living. She is also proud of having achieved the construction of her own home of good materials from a young age. Her first agricultural activities, specifically the production of cocoa and coffee, were done with her parents. Later, she inherited plots that had always supported her ancestors. Thanks to this, for the last 20 years, she has been able to forge an independent life for the sake of her daughters.\r\n\r\nShe likes to work in the field since doing good work during the season results in the corresponding product leaving a good profit, as in the case of organic cocoa. However the issue of transportation of the sacks of dry cocoa ready for distribution has not been resolved properly. For this reason, she hopes to continue working and manage to acquire a unit for the transport of heavy goods in the future.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the cocoa maintenance season, she wants to purchase seedling plants to graft as well as sacks of organic fertilizer consisting of island guano and compost, which is very essential to guarantee a good product and the end of the season. On the other hand, it is necessary to have additional money to hire laborers that require advanced payment.\r\n\r\nShe again has the satisfaction of achieving opportunity that MFP gives her, this being her eighth loan. She is very active and participatory in the various topics sometimes discussed for the benefit of her previous group loan.\r\n\r\nWith the new 2,000 soles she will purchase organic fertilizer consisting of island guano and compost, reserving part of her capital to hire day laborers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1236228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bags of organic fertilizer and compost, and also to hire day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":219.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":218.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":240.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":248.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":256.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":258.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":273.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":282.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.97,"local_amount":219.28,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":222.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188861},{"amount":84.76,"local_amount":218.73,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":221.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572758},{"amount":93.34,"local_amount":240.88,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":244.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122423},{"amount":96.41,"local_amount":248.8,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868243},{"amount":99.58,"local_amount":256.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":260.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577062},{"amount":100.21,"local_amount":258.6,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":262.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529358},{"amount":106.16,"local_amount":273.96,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":278.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974479},{"amount":109.57,"local_amount":282.76,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":286.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995912}],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T22:48:55Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"SUZANNE FORD","image":915708}},{"id":496898,"name":"Cerelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cerelyn works hard to support her family.

She has five children: three daughters and two sons.  Two of her children are attending a school in their community.\r\n\r\nHortencia currently has a grocery store in her home which is a source of income for her family.  She says that she started this business eight years ago when she saw the need that her own family and her neighbors had for a grocery store which would give all the members of their community easier access to basic household supplies.\r\n\r\nHortencia has noted that her sales remain steady but, during this season of the year, demand for some of her products increases.  This is why she would like to invest more cash in the business.  She is requesting a loan for 6,000 quetzales to buy more products and expand her grocery store.

","en":"Shahlo is a young mother with one child. Due to unfortunate circumstances, she divorced her husband. Currently, Shahlo lives with her mother and works as a waitress at a resort. \r\n\r\nShahlo first turned to MDO Arvand, LLC for a loan when she operated a small retail stall near a regional hospital, selling food to the hospital's visitors and patients. Since then, Shahlo has found another job, also related to retail, and now earns a very good income. She is requesting this loan to repair her apartment, which is in need of a renovation. Shahlo plans to use the loan to purchase building materials. \r\n\r\nPrevious loans from MDO Arvand have been very helpful to Shahlo and she expresses her gratitude for their financial

He's 36 years old and has five children aged 12, 14, 16, 18 and 19 years. He's a farmer by trade and grows corn and beans. He has gotten five years' worth of experience without any academic knowledge. He first started working on his father's land at age 12. That's how he acquired experience, since he needed to become independent from his parents and look for a way to provide food for his family. He currently gets help from his children and he sells his produce in the same district where he lives. His expectation is to increase production so that he can improve his family's living conditions.\r\nJuan requests the loan in order to purchase a cow and the rest of it is for purchasing supplies such as compost and fertilizer. That will help him to maintain his crop and increase its production, so he can offer his customers high quality produce at good

He started his business activity by running a butcher shop, but now operates his own kebab cafe in his yard. For this, Hrachik has constructed a few buildings in his yard: the open-air cafe is located on the second floor, with several small gazebos placed around it on the ground. The cafe is located near the Kapan-Kadzharan highway, and so Hrachik's main customers are truck drivers, as well as Kapan's residents. Hrachik would like to use the building's main floor, which is protected from the elements, to serve his customers in wintertime, thereby increasing his family's income.\r\n\r\nHrachik has received four loans from Nor Horizon. This time, he is asking for a loan of $1,600 to open the cafe's main floor for business: perform necessary repairs and purchase new tables, chairs, and tableware.\r\n\r\nHrachik is 57 years old and he is a professional cook. He is married and has two children: a son and a daughter. Hrachik's wife takes care of the household and helps her husband in the kebab cafe. Their daughter is married and lives with her husband.
