Twelve years ago she started her own business, a beauty parlor, at the corner of her house. She did this because her husband\u2019s income was not sufficient to meet everyday expenditures of the family members. She is a very hard-working lady; people living in her community prefer to come to her parlor, because she provides the best services.\r\n \r\nHowever, due to insufficient cash in hand she is unable to meet the requirements of the parlor. For this, she contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of Rs. 30,000. She will use the loan to purchase more products for hair treatment and skin care, and utensils like rollers and dryers. With the help of this loan, she will be catering to more customers at a time, which will ultimately improve her earnings.

This despite that fact that sometimes rain and sudden changes in the weather force them to stop working, which puts them back considerably. \r\n\r\nAs with all farmers, she needs sufficient capital to cover the entire growing season until the harvest, processing, and sale of the product.  On her list of requirements is sacks of manure and money to pay her workers. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to keep working at the same rhythm so that she can, in the future, buy her own parcel and continue working in this business. This is her first loan with Microfinzas Prisma. She is already grateful for the trust that has been shown her and she pledges to make her repayments punctually. She feels very comfortable with the way her communal bank works and promotes teamwork.\r\n\r\nThe 500.00 PEN (Peruvian nuevos soles) will compliment her working capital so she can buy inputs such as manure and also hire laborers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1236767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in a rented house with her husband, Jorge, who works extracting wood.  Virginia works making regional dishes, which are juanes [a tamale-like dish], tacacho con cecina [balls of dough made from plantains served with pork cracklings and chorizo], patarashca [fish wrapped in a bijao leaf and grilled], and smoked fish.  When Jorge is in the city, he helps her by shopping in the mornings as well as by helping her cook.  She currently makes her sales in front of her house.  She has had this business for 6 years, and she has earned 50% more profits, which gives her a lot of satisfaction.  Some time ago, she was robbed, and the thieves took almost everything that she had acquired with so much effort and work.  She decided to start again, and it is going well for her.  Her clientele has increased, and she is getting ahead.  She has thought about growing her business and acquiring her own location.  This is why she is requesting her second loan from the institution.

Since 1998, he's grown various cereal crops, such as wheat, barley and sunflowers. His wife and two oldest children assist him with running the business. Their first business expansion consisted of buying five milking cows. They're asking for a loan because now they want to buy a harrow with a pulverizer to plow and cultivate their field. In the future, they plan to purchase a tractor. Anatoliy also wants to start raising cattle.

She is a good woman who is kind and determined. She is a single mother of six children who live independently of her. She has her own house where she has lived alone for a long time. Thanks to her work, she was able to educate and feed her children. Her children are now of legal age and help her with some of her expenses, but she still works a lot in order to pay her expenses. Juana's work mainly consists of selling groceries; she purchases wholesale and then sells at retail prices. She obtains good profits that surpass her original investment. The business is located in her house and she has been running it for more than ten years. Occasionally she generates income by working as a seamstress - repairing garments or creating her own designs. She also makes a living by breeding pigs and selling them when they reach the ideal weight.\r\n\r\nShe likes her grocery business because it allows her to be in contact with her customers and distribute her time so she can do all the other work that is necessary for maintaining her finances. She hopes to continue with her growing business in this way and expand her workspace.\r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

She is married with four children, all of whom go to school. She has no additional family members. She sells Irish potatoes. She also gets an additional income from selling fruits at the market. She has been in this business for the past 6 years. She works six days a week. She has requested for a loan of Uganda Shillings 400,000 from MCDT SACCO to buy more bags of Irish potatoes to sell. Her major business challenges are transportation and seasonality.

She has four children and has been doing farming business for 10 years. Her primary income sources are eggs, tea and crops.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy more poultry birds.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is that she \"enjoys growing beans and maize!\" Her biggest challenge is \"high cost of inputs making work difficult.\" The goat has been given the name of \"Muiru\" because the goat is black in colour.\r\n\r\nJane was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, because she wants to improve her farming. This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"Microfinance helps small scale farmers to grow their businesses.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked how this loan would benefit her family, Jane replied that she will be able to provide for the family's basic needs as well as paying for their school fees.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jane owns the following: poultry, pump, bicycle, but does not own cow, pig, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household mosquito net and running water but does not have electricity, solar power, sewing machine, TV or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1237567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

The group's main business activity is selling clothes, and most of the members which make up this group are Haitian immigrants. \r\n\r\nRosa has two children and they live together with her father. She tells us that her greatest challenge now is to have her own house. She loves going to church and to work. Rosa is very excited to be receiving her 12th loan from Esperanza Internacional, after having satisfactorily paid off her previous loans and thereby given a step forward in the growth of her business.

Garciasville, Texas, she brought along her talent for cooking traditional and healthy Mexican meals. Her business, <i>Letty\u2019s Comida Casera<\/i>, makes food for seven schools. For the last four years, Leticia routinely begins her work daily at 7 a.m. with her employees: her husband and two assistants. She plans to hire more employees when her business allows. \r\n\r\nTo keep up with demand, Leticia needed working capital, cooking tools, extra tables for her kitchen and additional money to become a licensed business and, therefore, ventured out for a loan. After one of her son\u2019s friends told her of ACCION Texas Inc., she decided to apply and was approved. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money but, with this loan, I can gain money and expand my business. Because of ACCION, I was able to help people. I couldn\u2019t have done it without ACCION.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo find out more about Leticia\u2019s business, visit her Facebook page at:

A musician by birth, he is part of the famous group \"Tamb\u00f3\" from the community in the Atlantico department, where he plays the flute and the clarinet. He has performed with many renowned vallenato [folk music from the Colombian Caribbean region] artists, and one of his most strongly remembered collaborations is the chorus he recorded with a musical group for the soccer team of Barranquilla, \"Junior tu Pap\u00e1.\" Sergio, proud of his humble origins, remembers the times when he accompanied his father, who was from the countryside, to sell his harvest of pigeon peas directly in the market. This is where his experience as a businessman began. It was accompanied by his highest passion, which is music, which he also taught in the university of the arts. He feels satisfied for transporting the folklore of the Colombian Caribbean from one generation to the next. \r\n\r\nSergio makes his home with his wife, a hard-working woman who also knows about business. She sells a well-known product called \"raspao\" or flavored crushed ice at a school located in a nearby village. They have two children, ages 13 and 18. The adolescent is already connected to the musical arts, which he practices, and his beautiful daughter of 18 is the town queen, and he is very proud of them. Sergio also has a business where he offers internet services and sells related items such as stationery and cell phone recharges. He began it a year ago to increase the well-being of his family. His business opens its doors from 8 in the morning until 9 at night, and his principal customers are located in the community where he lives and the surrounding areas, where he and his family (who support him in everything) are very well known. Sergio is applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing, to invest in a candy shop and to begin building his credit history, which is his final goal, since in the past he had not had any loans, and he recognizes that this is necessary to make his business grow and generate a greater infrastructure of family entrepreneurship, which in the future will allow him to increase the quality of life of his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1236147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She started the business from a capital of about 2,000 Kenya shillings.\r\n\r\nEunice learnt of Milango from a friend and decided to join. She looks forward to being a renowned fresh fish dealer. Her main challenge currently is high cost of transportation; she buys fish from Kisumu, Kenya, about 1000 kms away from her business. This has forced her to deal majorly in dried fish. But she is now applying for a loan of 107,250 Kenya shillings to purchase stock of dried fish.\r\n\r\nThe income from the business will enable her to educate her

She is married and has three children aged 6, 8, and 11 years. All are school-going children. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sento established her mayonnaise, Ovaltine, milk, air freshener, luncheon meat, onions, rice, and sugar business. She began her business because she didn't attend school because her parents did not value girls' education. Her mother only introduced her to business. \r\n\r\nWhen she got married, her husband gave her some amount of money to start a business. Working 7 days a week and 15 hours a day, she earns about 1,800,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nSento would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. She requires a loan in order to buy flour (4 bags at 120,000 each), sugar (5 bags at 120,000 each), rice (3 bags at 130,000 each), soap (4 cartons at 250,000 each), and sachet milk (6 packets at 85,000 each).The balance of 20,000 SLL will be used for transportation. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sento plans to build a house and provide quality education for her children, as well as expand the business.

It is a powerful soup of great nutritional value on account of the concentrate made from beef innards, ram's heads, potatoes, beans, corn and various spices. This food is begun the day before it is consumed because of its complicated preparation (often done as a group) and in some parts of the mountains it is often called \"sopa de mote,\" \"sopa de mondongo\" or \"mondongo.\" She has her sales post which is located in the town of Guardia.

She lives with her partner and has 3 children of 26, 23, and 18 years of age. They live together in their own home. Neida works making clothes for women, men and children. She works with great patience to make the custom clothes that her clients order and also often makes clothes to her own design. She sells some of these in a small space in her home. She has been doing this work for more than 15 years and has always worked alone and says that she has never had a client ask for their money back as she has always been able to meet their needs. What she likes about her work is that she can translate her designs into clothes to be worn and this motivates her greatly to continue working.

Victor sells each bag of 70 kilos for 120 Peruvian soles, so, each year he strives to care for the plants, so that the most common diseases such as coffee-leaf rot and rooster\u2019s eye fungus, don\u2019t ruin the leaves and coffee beans.\r\n\r\nAs well, achiote planting is profitable because demand for the product is throughout the year.\r\n\r\nA year ago he began with the development of coffee nurseries and he now has them ready to plant. He requires labour. He is requesting support to achieve this short term goal. This is his 4th credit with MFP.

district of Odisha, India formed a Joint Liability Group named Maha Laxmi with the intention of expanding their existing businesses by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Dalimba, an energetic lady of 27 years sitting in the middle of the photo with her hand raised, is one of the group members. She is very active and always cheerful. Her family consists of her husband, one son who is nine and one daughter who is five years old. .Both the kids are studying in the local primary school.\r\n\r\nFor the last 10 years, Dalimba has been running a clothes vending business and a tailoring center with the help and support of her husband. She purchases saris and ready made garments from the local market as well as from the wholesale market 200 kilometers away. Her husband travels to different villages and weekly markets on a bike to sell saris and garments. Her stock includes saris ranging from 500 INR to 3000 INR. She earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from her existing business. But her present income is like hand to mouth for her family. So Dalimba wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business.

rural village called Luthurbandh in Titilagarh block of Boalngir district of Odisha, India. Bolangir district is one of the underdeveloped areas of Odisha with 80% rural population. The young lady sitting in the first row with her hand raised is Bhodebi. She resides with her husband, two sons who are four and two years old, and her father and mother in-law. To increase the income of her family, in the year 2010, Bhodebi, along with four like-minded women of her village formed a group named Maha Laxmi and received a loan from Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n \r\nBhodebi and her husband run two businesses. Her husband manages a betel nut shop in the market area of her village and Bhodebi runs a general fancy store with fancy items like bangles, talc, plastic items, cosmetics, ornaments etc. in her house. Prior to this business, Bhodebi\u2019s husband was running a well-established general store in the market yard. But due to jealousness of some of the vested interest people in her village, her husband was forced to close the business. During that period, her family was leading a very pitiful life due to acute financial problems. This situation compelled her to find ways and means to maintain her family. So Bhodebi, in consultation with her husband, mortgaged her gold ornaments for 10,000 INR and started the fancy store with a low profile. Now her fancy store is running well. Bhodebi brings stock from different towns.  Presently, she is selling fancy items worth 300 INR to 500 INR per day from which she gets 15 to 20% profit. From this small income, she barely manages her family's expenses. So she wants to increase the volume of her business to increase the income. From this loan of 10,000 INR, Bhodebi wants to invest the entire amount to purchase different varieties of bangles\r\n\r\nBhodebi is confident enough to have a business of her own and hopes to give a better education to her two sons.\r\n\r\nThe other four energetic group members are Manjulata, Bhubaneswari, Bhaktilata and Puspanjali who are running a stationary store, and egg center, a footwear center and a puffed rice business, respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1238039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase bangles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Luthurbandh,Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-18T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-18T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manjulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhubaneswari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhaktilata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhodebi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":66000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":66000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T20:56:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":497434,"name":"Mourine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mourine is a 36-year-old married woman.

She is an active member of a JLG named Maa Ram Chandi located in Muniguda village of Rayagada district of Odisha, India. Muniguda is a small town bordered by a green forest, a mountain range and one river. Maa Ram Cchandi group consists of four energetic women who are running some businesses for the financial upliftment of their families.\r\n\r\nPuspanjali resides with her husband, one daughter aged 23 and one son aged 18 who are studying in college. She runs a small general store at Muniguda with the help of her husband. She sells rice, sugar, potatoes, oil, soap, toothpaste, etc. She also makes leaf plates with her daughter to add some supplementary income to her family. Puspanjali earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from the existing businesses, but as the maintenance cost has increased, the present income is not sufficient for her to manage the family. Previously, her group has already taken three loans from Mahashakti Foundation and repaid the entire loans on time. This time, she plans to use the loan for the purpose of including more spices items and stationary items like notebooks, pencils, pens, and compasses for students in her general shop. She hopes this will generate more income for her family. Puspanjali hopes to see her daughter as a nurse and her son as a police inspector and get them married into a well-reputed family.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Somarani, Papidei and Rangabati who run a Tiffin hotel, sell leaf plates at wholesale and run a barbershop. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1238044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase notebooks, compasses, pens, pencils, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-18T21:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-18T21:00:48Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Papi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rangabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Somarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":128000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":128000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T11:33:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":497450,"name":"Tuoi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tuoi would like to take a further loan to buy rice and raw food to make meals for sale.

shop.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to be an entrepreneur for about eight years,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t happened because I haven\u2019t been able to purchase the equipment.\u201d She first visited ACCION Texas Inc. five years ago. While trying to start her business, Deidra went to Small Business Administration, where she learned about ACCION Texas. From there, she was inspired to invest some of her money to open the store, which currently carries 14 flavors and will sell 100 flavors by April, when the warm weather returns. Though shaved ice is a seasonal item, Deidra operates year-round by also selling hot dogs and nachos.\r\n\r\nDeidra started her business in her grandmother\u2019s backyard. \u201cI did so well, but it got to be too much with the heat, so I stopped.\u201d After taking a business class and seeing the need for a shaved ice store within her area, Deidra decided to return to work.\r\n\r\nTropical Express is \u201creally the only shop in the area with shaved ice,\u201d Deidra says. The shop operates with a three-member team, working and volunteering to help keep the start-up costs down. Deidra needs extra help now, but plans to postpone the hiring process until the summer. She plans to hire high school and college students.\r\n\r\nThe ACCION loan supplied Deidra with hot dog cookers, syrup containers and a large cooler. Without the help of ACCION, Deidra says, \u201cI\u2019d probably still be sweating and trying to start up. I really appreciate ACCION helping me and being patient with me while working through the loan process.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6150,"image":{"id":1237848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in the company of Esteban, her husband. Together, they have five children, but she only raises two of them in her own home. In a space of her home she constructed a small garden where she plants a variety of good-quality products which she fertilizes with organic fertilizer, like bird guano, because of which she obtains large and healthy food from the earth. In the future she is thinking of planting in more extensive plots of land and therefore obtaining more income. Now, she only limits herself to planting peas, corn, ullucos, and potatoes, on rented land since she has none of her own. According to what she says, she rents it for the whole year, and therefore would not have to pay monthly. Furthermore, she raises sheep that along with her food crops she sells in the city market.

She lives with her daughter, Stefany, in the house that she inherited from her parents and where she has lived since she was born.  She has worked in agriculture for 7 years.  She produces potatoes and grains.  Parallel to growing crops, she also raises cattle.  She sells the bulls once they are big and at a good weight to be able to buy smaller ones.  In this way, she generates income for her family.  She sells her harvests in the main market in her city on Wednesdays and Sundays, when the commercial markets are held.  Approximately every two months, she sells her animals at the livestock market in her area.  During these years, everything has gone well with her profits, which motivates her to continue with this effort for the well-being of her young children.

activities by forming a group called \u201cEsther Group\u201d. They live in Motbung village of Manipur state, which is located in the northeastern part of India.\r\n\r\nHebem is pictured with a raised hand. She is the mother of three daughters and two sons, and she is 40 years old. She lives as a single parent after her husband abandoned her for another woman. Now she lives with her children and one sister in-law. In spite of her marriage problem, she is determined and happy that all her children go to a private school in the nearby town, which is 5 km away.\r\n\r\nShe owns a paddy field to cultivate rice, which is a staple food for her people. She practices jhum cultivation [slash-and-burn] and grows vegetables such as pulses, pumpkins, yams and peas to sell at the market. She also cultivates ginger on a large scale for bigger profits. Every night before going to bed, she weaves clothes to sell to meet her daily needs. She is thankful to her sister-in-law for standing beside her and helping to raise the children.\r\n\r\nWith her previous loan, she has been investing in the ginger plantation, usually harvested in the month of January. Now she is hoping to get a good harvest when the month comes. The proceeds help towards enrolling her children in school for another term.
