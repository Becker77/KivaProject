She lives with her husband Gay, with whom she has 4 children. But only one child, Cirila, lives with them. She looks after Cirila in the house that she bought 10 years ago. For the last 20 years she has worked in agriculture and cattle farming. Mainly she grows wheat, potatoes, barley, peas and corn. She also rears cattle, mostly bulls, to sell at the livestock fairs. At harvest time wholesale buyers come in trucks to where she lives to buy what she has harvested. This is how she earns her income. It is more practical for her this way because she does not have to spend money on transport, although she admits that the money she earns is lower. \r\n\r\nOver the years Carmen and her husband have come to realise that the work they do is a good option for them. Any difficulties they have encountered during this time have been overcome because they have been able to provide for their 4 children. She will continue to do the same work now, as it will enable her to sustain their family life. She has been working collectively in the communal bank \"Productores Huancas\" for several years.

She lives with her husband, Anibal. The have 2 children: Lisbeth and Adriano. She takes care of them in the house she inherited 20 years ago. \r\n\r\nWith 17 years of experience planting wheat, barley, beans and potatoes, she has been able to strengthen her home's finances. Every day she does the rounds of her farmland. Once the harvest season arrives her task is to pack the crops into sacks to take them to the market every weekend, in the urban area. She sells them there and so makes the profits she has been waiting 6 months for. At harvest times she needs a lot of help and all the members of her family work. She also hires labourers to help with this work. She is very happy to carry out this work because it allows her to enjoy the countryside, and, although the work is very tiring, it is her way of life. \r\n\r\nOver the next few years, her wish is to plant more stretches of land in order to keep selling and making profits. She has worked for a few years in a group in the Communal Bank \"productores huancas\" and this is the 6th loan with MFP.

In 2008, these hard working tribal women came together as a group to help one another to empower themselves and improve their earning capacity. They belong to Kholep Village in Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. \r\n\r\nLhingneikim, who is raising her hand in the photo, is one of the group members. She is 42 years old and lives with her three daughters, one son and her husband. Her husband is 47 years old. He drives a van on a hire basis and all her children are getting a good education in a private school, which is about 4 km in distance from her village. Her husband's income alone cannot support the family, so they are dependent on her business. \r\n \r\nShe took a previous loan of INR 5,000 and with this loan she bought two piglets and yarn for weaving shawls and wrap-arounds. With much struggle and hard work, she was able to pay off her first loan. In this way, she contributed to the family income. With that loan and sale proceeds from two of her full-grown pigs, she bought a handloom (a simple machine to weave) to increase weaving in terms of production. Her daughters assisted her by selling door to door after school and on holidays. \r\n  \r\nNow she needs another loan to expand her weaving activities. She hopes to get a good price for the grown pigs with the festival coming ahead. With this money and the money from the loan, she plans to repair her weaving loom and to buy one more handloom to increase her production double fold. She is happy and wishes good fortune to all the lenders around the world so that they may continue their kindness to helpless people like her and extends her warm greetings on behalf of the group. \u201cHappy Thanksgiving for you and your family\u201d.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1238124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to repair her weaving loom and buy a new one ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T01:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T01:20:01Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chochong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoinem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaijahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dimkholam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahneilhing ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kholneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaineichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neikhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T09:34:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":497588,"name":"Mwanarusi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanarusi always dreams of being a prominent woman who is responsible in the community.

Her partner is Efren, a welder, and they have a child. Rosemarie, together with her partner, manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRosemarie operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosemarie hopes that her business will expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

He lives in the municipality Chichgalpa, near a distilling company, known for the production of sugar cane and distillation. This is one of the hottest locations in Nicaragua. \n\n3 years ago he was diagnosed with an illness.  His work since childhood has been to cut sugar cane and irrigation of the fields. Due to his suffering from the terrible disease, no company is ready to formally employ him despite the fact that he is young person. \n\nSince he was diagnosed with this disease, despite being a strong man, no one will hire him to avoid medical costs. Nowadays he lives on a reduced pension with which he pays his family costs. He counts on a small business that consists of sale of artisanal candy. Which with great difficulty he sells them with his wife to the field where the cutters of sugar cane are; He has two children that are in elementary school and they participate in the sale of candy to supplement the family income. This business covers the majority of his medical expenses.  \n\nHe wakes up at 4am every day to complete his daily labors and after he devotes himself to the production of sweets and consecutively to the sale of the sweets. When he can leave he helps his wife to charge the pending payments.

Her husband died of diabetes when her children were at an early age. Since then, she has been looking after her children and paying all household expenses alone by providing tailoring services in her community. She faced a very difficult time after the death of her husband. She recently had a uterus operation but she is still working with full delegation to provide for the family needs. She works 8 hours a day. \r\nIn spite of working full time, she takes care of all the housework and makes sure that she can fulfill all of her children's needs.  \r\n\r\nAll of the income which comes from her tailoring business goes to the household expenses due to which she is unable to save any amount for her children\u2019s future but she is very much thankful to Allah Almighty that she is having her own house to live in. \r\n\r\nHer older son owns a small shop selling fried chicken at the corner of the street but his income is insufficient and the other one did matriculation*** and took some computer courses as well but he is jobless. Her one daughter did matriculation and got married and now has 2 sons, while the youngest one has recently completed B.com (Bachelor of Commerce)\r\n\r\nGulnaz, as a member of this 6-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase fabric and a separate sewing machine for her tailoring business since she currently has only one sewing machine which she uses for her tailoring business as well as for personal use. \r\n\r\nGulnaz hopes that the loan will be beneficial to them. \r\n\r\nNote: In the picture Gulnaz holds a passbook in her hand.\r\n\r\n***See

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \n\nMary oversees operations of their jeepney transportation business. \n\nJeepneys were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines. \n\nMary has one jeepney (14-16 person capacity). Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit.\n\nMary dreams to have a good life with her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

is Sharon, 49, a resident of Taguig, Philippines. Single, she manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSharon operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands.\r\n\r\nSharon hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life by the grace of God.

She has been in this business for five year and says it is going well.  Now she is requesting your help to buy more merchandise (groceries and fuel) to meet customer demand.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Progreso Huayounioc\" and this is her 10th loan through MFP, where she has always been punctual in her payments.  She is one of the most active members of the group at this time.\r\n\r\nAmelia will use the loan to buy groceries (cheese, fudge, fruit, soft-drinks and other items), as well as fuels such as gasoline.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1237811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy cheese, fudge, fruit, soft drinks and other items, as well as fuels.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T10:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T10:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":106.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":115.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":112.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":124.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":128.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":129.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":138.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":143.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.55,"local_amount":106.37,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":110.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188888},{"amount":46.31,"local_amount":115.77,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":120.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572785},{"amount":45.07,"local_amount":112.69,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":117.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122449},{"amount":266.07,"local_amount":665.17,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":693.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868270}],"funded_date":"2012-11-24T16:57:08Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":497705,"name":"Taj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taj is an energetic 42-year-old married woman.

Juntos viven en Quinid\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nHace 4 a\u00f1os Stephany aprendi\u00f3 con la ayuda de una amiga la actividad de vender cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo de forma ambulante.

","en":"Stephany is a young, 20-year-old woman, who has run into many challenges in her life.  One of them was that she was unable to continue her professional training, despite her hard work, and only finished high school.  Now she is trying to get ahead with her small son, and has the challenge of educating and supporting him.  They live in Quinid\u00e9 Canton in the province of Esmeraldas which supplies many cities of Ecuador with products such as bananas, cocoa, coffee, African palm and forest products.  Commerce is the main work of the population in this area, especially now that there are more roads leading into this canton, allowing for a good amount of trade, especially on weekends.  That is when all types of merchants go to the markets in search of potential customers, most of whom are farmers.  Tourism is also an important activity for this canton because of its natural ecosystem, with a variety of attractions, such as water falls, sweet water rivers, forests, and the flora and fauna that adorn the city.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Stephany learned from a friend how to sell cosmetics by catalogue, working as a street vendor.  Despite having divorced her husband, she has sought out ways to care for her son, while also working hard to support him.  With experience, she has learned how to manage her income correctly; and now that her son is growing, it is easier for her to go out to offer her products to customers.  Every day she takes advantage of the opportunities and needs of her customers, most of whom are women.  She feels ready to take the next step which is to set up business in one location.  Therefore, she has decided to establish a space in her house where she can offer discounts and sale items as a strategy to attract customers.  Stephany wants to earn more profit and spend more time with her son.  That is why she has requested a loan to fix up a space in her house (by cleaning, painting, installing display cases, etc.) to sell cosmetics.  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, thanks to work done by Kiva, was able to give her the loan and train her to run her business correctly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1237788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To fix up a space in her house to sell cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quinind\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephany Lissette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":739.2,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":64.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":75.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.66,"local_amount":64.71,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":65.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126227},{"amount":71.58,"local_amount":70.55,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":71.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516815},{"amount":72.62,"local_amount":71.58,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":72.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068671},{"amount":74.45,"local_amount":73.38,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":74.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494938},{"amount":74.78,"local_amount":73.7,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":74.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524866},{"amount":78.05,"local_amount":76.93,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":78.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133171},{"amount":78.26,"local_amount":77.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":78.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313715},{"amount":234.6,"local_amount":231.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":234.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565320}],"funded_date":"2012-12-01T20:33:01Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":497303,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia tiene 42 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo Abel y sus 2 hijos.

She lives with Enel, a clerk, who is the father of their 2 children whom they love very much.  They live comfortably together in their own home which they bought through a great deal of hard work.  \r\n\r\nAzucena's business involves loading wood-drying kilns for local timber companies.  These huge metal kilns are used by wood processing companies to dry wood, which improves its quality and durability.  With the support of her partner, who works in one of the timber companies which use these services, she manages to employ up to 5 people to help her.  She set up her business more than 18 months ago using her own money and, so far, has run it single-handedly.  She believes that the business is cost-effective because it generates good profits which have enabled her to cover her household expenses.  When her partner, seeing a business opportunity, came up with the idea, she decided to set up the business to help him cover the household expenses and provide a better quality of life for their children.    \r\n\r\nNow, due to the good results she is achieving, she has plans to expand into selling clothing, another business which she knows can be profitable.  This will be her 9th loan from the MFP institution.  She is happy in the knowledge that she will have the financial support to continue with her business and is also grateful to her communal bank for the support it offers to people with businesses.  She will use the 2,500 nuevos soles which she is applying for to provide meals for those she employs to load the wood-drying kilns and to pay their wages.

Her work is lately being contracted from farther and farther way, so Betty recently purchased a large van to transport her work tools: welding torch, metal saw, and other tools. Betty enjoys this work because she loves what she does and she has been very successful in it, getting more and more customers, which keeps her profits growing. She hopes to one day open a metal shop of her own and increase her earnings enough to hire employees and give other people the chance to work as well. \r\n\r\nThis is Betty's second loan from MFP.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese government. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Besides dairy farming, Tamila grows maize on the family-owned agricultural land and sells the harvested products for a good price. In addition, the family owns a vineyard and produces wine and vodka with the harvested grapes. They have three pigs as well and sell piglets seasonally.\r\n\r\nTamila works hard to do her best for her family. She wants to make some improvements and repairs to her old house but the amount of money she has isn't enough, so she is requesting a loan to cover the costs of repairing the house such as changing

Her husband is a worker who earns a low salary, which is not enough to cover the family's needs. Ne'ma is preparing wedding requirements for her son who will marry soon, but the amount of money she has is not enough to cover all the costs. \r\n\r\nNe'ma is requesting a loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing new bedroom furniture in order to improve living conditions of her son and his bride. Ne'ma is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her son appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending help text at

She has been in the business of selling clothes for many years. She is famous for providing formal, bridal dresses for occasions like weddings, engagements, etc.. At this time she has retained many customers. Her husband is employed in a small retail store but his income alone is not sufficient to bear daily expenditures of his family members. Razia is highly contributing to the family income to support her family through all her hard work. Her customer base is diverse and varied. She is much in demand and highly appreciated among her customers. However, due to low cash in hand, she is facing difficulties in fulfilling the orders of her customers on time.

Her son and husband help her by taking turns staying at the shop so she can go home early to take care of her other family members, through preparing food and reviewing her children's lessons if requested.\r\n\r\nLina is applying for a loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua, in order to increase her business capital with special Christmas gifts and gadgets.

With the money that she saved, she decided to open her own business.  She is currently the owner of a small grocery, which she has run for the last two years.  Irma has her husband's support.  She would like to sell her products in her neighborhood.  She expects to increase her sales and earn a better income. \r\nIrma is requesting the loan in order to purchase basic food items like rice, sugar, beans, cooking oils, snacks, etc.  Since her objective is to increase her sales once she has more products in her inventory and to offer a greater variety of products to her customers, her future plans are to expand her grocery to earn a larger income and to purchase a display case for her products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1238209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase basic food items like rice, sugar, beans, cooking oil, snacks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma Del Carmen \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":230,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":25.56,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":27.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332006179},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":25.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":27.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568954},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":25.56,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":27.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118571},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":25.56,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":27.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531192},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":25.56,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":27.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573143},{"amount":30.41,"local_amount":27.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":30.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373165841},{"amount":27.68,"local_amount":25.47,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":27.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971667},{"amount":25.26,"local_amount":23.23,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837046},{"amount":27.74,"local_amount":25.52,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":27.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860367}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T04:15:12Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":497915,"name":"Manal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After getting her previous loan, Manal bought more clothing items and started selling school stationery and toys for kids.

studying in school. She lives in the village of Bbalugaon of Odisha, India. Renubala is a housewife who is very happy and responsible. She alternates her household activities with her work in her business. She has a business farming her paddy and selling her crops in the market in Khurda district in Odisha, India. She already has had this business for four years and it is going very well. At this time, Renubala is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers, seeds and new and advanced tools for farming.

poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad. En varios sectores  de esta provincia, residen familias que se dedican a la agricultura, y muchas veces su esfuerzo no es valorado, pues las empresas pagan costos muy bajos por los frutos que sus tierras producen, sin embargo, el sustento siempre est\u00e1 presente. En esta ciudad reside Mar\u00eda, una mujer de 41 a\u00f1os que tiene 2 hijos que estudian en el colegio. Ella termin\u00f3 la educaci\u00f3n secundaria y el obst\u00e1culo m\u00e1s grande que ella ha atravesado es la migraci\u00f3n de su esposo H\u00e9ctor a Espa\u00f1a. La necesidad de una mejor calidad de vida, separ\u00f3 a esta familia pero el lazo que sembraron desde el principio, los ha mantenido unidos en medio de la distancia. \nMar\u00eda desde muy ni\u00f1a aprendi\u00f3 la actividad de la agricultura con varios frutos, hace 10 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 esta actividad con su esposo y actualmente lo desarrolla sola con un poco de ayuda de sus hijos. Su experiencia en el negocio ha dado muy buenos resultados y cada vez ha incrementado el negocio con nuevos productos. Todos los d\u00edas entre 8 y 10 horas alternadas con el cuidado y atenci\u00f3n a sus hijos, Mar\u00eda cuida los cultivos y prepara los que est\u00e1n listos para la venta, adem\u00e1s atiende a sus clientes de la mejor forma posible para as\u00ed entregar un valor agregado a esta actividad. El cacao es muy demandado en el sector por lo que Mar\u00eda solicita un cr\u00e9dito para incrementar sus cultivos de este fruto que es muy apetecido internacionalmente. Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa fue en donde encontr\u00f3 el apoyo y la agilidad que necesitaba, adem\u00e1s que la asesor\u00eda que le brind\u00f3 el ejecutivo que le visit\u00f3 personalmente, sirvi\u00f3 de mucho para que ella realice mejoras en varias \u00e1reas de su negocio. Mar\u00eda espera que este cr\u00e9dito aporte al crecimiento de su negocio y por ende ella pueda obtener mayores utilidades que le permitan dar a sus hijos la educaci\u00f3n profesional que ella no pudo obtener. ","en":"Quinind\u00e9 is a district in the province of Esmeraldas that provides various products to cities in Ecuador like banana, cacao, coffee, African palm and products from the forest and commercial activity is also a daily way for the majority of the inhabitants to get ahead and even more so after the roads to get to town have been expanded which has permitted a lot of commercial traffic, especially on the weekends when all types of businessmen come to offer their products at the market to potential customers who are usually people from the countryside. \r\n\r\nTourism has also been an important activity in this area because the ecosystem has a lot of different places to be visited like waterfalls, fresh water, and woods that have flowers and animals that surround the city. In various sectors of the province, there are families that work in agriculture and a lot of the time their work is not valued demonstrated by the fact that companies pay very low prices for the fruit of their labor, nevertheless, there is always food present. In the city where Mar\u00eda lives, a woman who is 41 years old and has two children who go to high school. She herself finished secondary school and the biggest obstacle that she has faced is the migration of her husband Hector to Spain. The necessity to find a better quality of life separated this family but their bond remains strong, being formed from the beginning, and it is this bond that has kept them together despite being so far apart. \r\n\r\n Mar\u00eda, since she was very little, learned about the agricultural industry with various plants and 10 tears ago she undertook this activity with her husband but currently she has been developing their business on her own, with a little help from her children. Her experience in the business has given her very good results and every time she has expanded with new products. Every day between 8 and 10 hours, with the care and attention of her children, Mar\u00eda,takes care of her fields and prepares those that are ready for market. She also tends to her clients in the best way possible in order to give a certain dignity to her work. \r\n\r\n Cacao is a very demanding sector to work in and this is why Mar\u00eda is applying for a loan to increase her production of this plant, that is desired internationally.

She has three children with ages ranging from 7 years to 13 years. She describes herself to be a social and God-fearing woman. \r\n\r\nShe operates a retail business where she sells water and chickens. She has been involved in this business for five years. Her business is located at a highly populated area, and her primary customers are local residents.

She has two children. She describes herself to be a social and honest woman. \r\n\r\nShe operates a food stall where she sells food. Her business is located within a slum and her primary customers are residents from the slum.
