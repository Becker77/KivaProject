To increase his agricultural business, he plans on using the following strategies: to modernize his agricultural techniques (using chemical fertilizers and manure), to harvest the potatoes once they are sufficiently ripe, and to look for new markets. Elias' ambition is to become a successful distributor of agricultural produce, particularly potatoes. For his family, he will improve their home, ensure his children's education, and purchase a vehicle. In addition to agriculture, Elias also works raising livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1236554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy potato seeds, fertilizers, and to pay his workforce.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":817.6,"local_amount":495516,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":509812.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364450130},{"amount":7.4,"local_amount":4484,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4613.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372854406}],"funded_date":"2012-11-23T14:23:22Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:06:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":497892,"name":"Jagabalia Self Help Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2006, 13 women from a village stepped out and formed a group named Jagabalia Self Help Group in Odisha.

Shehnaz borrowed funds from Kashf to invest in her business five years ago when it was almost at the verge of liquidation. She worked hard in her store and eventually sales increased.

He lives in the Akhalkalaki District with wife and two children (5 and 6 years old).  Edgar has requested a loan from a local financial institution several times for a family business start-up, without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of his low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nEdgar used to have a mini-bus and transported cargo to the capital city. He was also involved in spice and seeds trading at the local open market, but the business was stopped because of financial problems. Edgar went abroad to find a suitable job there but his trip was unsuccessful and he came back to his district and decided to start a new business. Edgar purchased a well equipped store at the local open market and plans to set up a shoe store.\r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved by a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received loan Edgar will purchase a large variety of shoes as competition is high in the region and business won\u2019t be successful if he doesn't have a wide choice.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly increase the family income and Edgar will be able to renovate his house, which is old and damaged.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1239222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

She became famous by doing her fine stitching. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet her orders on time, Shabana has requested a loan of 15,000 Pakistan rupees (PKR), which enable her to purchase material such as spools of thread and packs of buttons and zippers in different colors. This will enable her to meet the growing demands of her customers, which will ultimately help in generating more cash.

Nirasa is one of these women. The lady standing second from left, wearing a red shawl in the photograph, is Nirasa. Nirasa, 32 years old, is a very energetic lady who lives with her husband, one son who is 13 years old and one daughter who is 7 years old. The children are continuing their studies in the local school. \r\n\r\nNirasa has been running a general store in the heart of the town for the last two years with the help of her husband. She sells items like biscuits, dust tea, oil, shampoo, toffee, and grocery items. She has been able to increase the variety of items in her general store by taking her first loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Her daily net income from the existing business is around Rs 400\/-. With this income, her household expenses are in a deplorable state.  Nirasa purchases items from the local wholesaler twice a week. With the present loan, Nirasa wants to increase her stock by purchasing items like lentils, oil, soap, washing powder, shampoo etc. for her general store.

Mayda also hopes to continue to surpass herself, to move forward with her business and benefit her family, who she deeply loves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1239400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials and supplies such as fabric, craft foam, thread and accessories, to decorate with","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T23:00:51Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T23:00:51Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayda Acela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70711},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":73605},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75323},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77080},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78879},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80719},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82603},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84530},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86502},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90048}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.77,"local_amount":70711,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":72558.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130853},{"amount":41.41,"local_amount":73605,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":75528.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519709},{"amount":42.37,"local_amount":75323,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":77291.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071547},{"amount":43.35,"local_amount":77080,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":79093.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497765},{"amount":44.37,"local_amount":78879,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":80939.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527571},{"amount":45.41,"local_amount":80719,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":82828.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928335},{"amount":46.46,"local_amount":82603,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84761.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705489},{"amount":47.55,"local_amount":84530,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":86738.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967781},{"amount":48.66,"local_amount":86502,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":88762.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816986},{"amount":50.65,"local_amount":90048,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":92400.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323268}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T11:21:28Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:53:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jamie Schau","image":1143325}},{"id":498029,"name":"Qendrim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Qendrim is 27 years old and married.

He is a father of six children, and lives in the town of Koutiala. Due to family problems, he left school early, and became interested in profit-making activities from a very young age. After several unsuccessful businesses, he now works selling smoked fish, and has done so for more than 10 years. He is well-known because the smoked fish he sells are the most sought-after in Koutiala. \r\n\r\nIn order to be able to increase his working capital and strengthen his sales capacity, Adama decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. He is now on his third individual loan, and his former loans were all successfully repaid. He gets his supplies in Korientz\u00e9, in the region of Mopti, from Bozo and Somon\u00f4 fishermen. His sales are made in Koutiala fish market to male and female customers, on a cash and credit basis. \r\n\r\nWith this financing, Adama hopes to make a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA, which he will use to pay the interest on his Soro Yiriwaso loan and provide for his family. The rest of the money will be reinvested in his business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1236644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy smoked fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-20T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-20T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":36780.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243424},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":36780.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339625012},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":36780.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179908},{"amount":71.42,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:15:46Z","rounded_local_amount":36780.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922710},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":36780.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636250},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36780.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029781},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":35714.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":36780.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819363}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T16:44:45Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":498071,"name":"Adjoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adjoa sells gari, a food made out of cassava, at Ampayin near Elmina.

To improve her business by getting stocks of beans, as well as to ensure customer satisfaction, she wasted no time in joining the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution several years ago. \r\n\r\nAminata has obtained group loans from Soro Yiriwaso  in the past, all of which were repaid on time, and she is on her fifth individual loan. She gets her supplies from farmers in the villages close to Koutiala, and prepares her fary biscuits and sells them from home. She hopes to make a monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA, which she plans to use to pay interest on her Soro Yiriwaso loans and contribute to paying her family's daily expenses. The rest will be invested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1236640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy bags of beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-20T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-20T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":34328.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339625011},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":34328.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179907},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":34328.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922709},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":34328.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636249},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34328.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029780},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":34328.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819362}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T11:42:09Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":498078,"name":"Queen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"People are always looking to better themselves.

She makes a living sewing skirts for the \"Cholitas\" (members of a Bolivian indigenous movement) in her own workshop which is found in the Villa Tunari zone of the city of El Alto.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan cycle within the Institution. Martha is going to use the loan to purchase fabric for the making of skirts. The reason she is requesting this loan is the large demand she has. She has orders to deliver to different markets, and lacks capital for the purchase of fabric and thread.\r\n\r\nMartha faces challenges in her business such as the lack of equipment and sometimes a lack of material when they give her wholesale orders, depending on the work she has to do. She is going to use her profits to buy fabric.\r\n\r\nMartha is a hard-working person whose wish is to have a big workshop and hire employees, and that way she can teach young people the trade of apparel making."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4425,"image":{"id":1239363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric and thread for the making of skirts ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2012-11-20T01:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-20T01:40:01Z","loan_amount":4425,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fidelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Marcos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rose Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yesica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Judith Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":4425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.51},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3444.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3636.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3737.73},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3873.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4014.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4160.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4312.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":499.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":527.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":542.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":582.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":603.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":481.6,"local_amount":3319.51,"processed_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3327.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322979910},{"amount":499.76,"local_amount":3444.66,"processed_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3453.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331117038},{"amount":527.55,"local_amount":3636.23,"processed_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3645.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339508554},{"amount":542.28,"local_amount":3737.73,"processed_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3746.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347060140},{"amount":562.01,"local_amount":3873.79,"processed_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3883.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355805481},{"amount":582.48,"local_amount":4014.79,"processed_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4024.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364513401},{"amount":603.68,"local_amount":4160.94,"processed_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4171.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372918592},{"amount":625.64,"local_amount":4312.35,"processed_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4322.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381696392}],"funded_date":"2012-11-27T17:19:26Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:07:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jamie Schau","image":1143325}},{"id":498121,"name":"Mama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mama, 35, is a widowed mother of three children.

She currently needs to expand her working capital, which is why she has applied for a Kiva loan. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which she will use to buy undergarments, outerwear, medications, multi-use products and Christmas decorations.

She lives with her husband and her children in Koutiala, in the Sikasso region.\r\n\r\nKorotoumou did not have the opportunity to attend school for many years, which explains her current interest in income-generating activities (such as buying and selling fabrics, shoes and others).  She has actually been involved in this activity for several years and her goods are in high demand from her customers.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the size of her business and to meet the needs of her customers, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso over two years ago.

She lives with her two daughters in her own house.\r\n\r\nShe learned the basic knowledge of farm work when she was a child. 22 years ago, she became independent and began to carry out these tasks for the well-being of her family. Her principal crops are potatoes, wheat, barley, and beans, which she brings to the local market after every harvest.

Thanks to her work and sacrifice, she was able to obtain many plots of agricultural land and to build her cosy house where she raised her sons, all of whom are fully grown and independent.\r\n\r\nHer life currently focuses on raising her animals. She has 87 guinea pigs, four sheep, and a cow, all of which she cares for with dedication. Her secret is planting alfalfa, which she uses as feed. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, she fitted out a room in her house to sell food on the weekends. She is well known for the delicious dishes which she cooks. She also plants Cuzco corn in her fields. She only used one plot this season, because she rented out the rest at a good price. She is hoping for a good harvest, since she worked hard on her land.\r\n\r\nNow Francisca would like to increase the quantity of her livestock. She recently sold about 300 guinea pigs, and she needs to stock up for next season's sales.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the \"San Lorenzo\" solidarity group, and this is her twelfth loan with MFP. She is grateful for all of your help, as she will receive the loan which she needs to achieve her goals. She also promises to be punctual in her payments, as the members of her association are responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nFrancisca will use this support to invest in the purchase of organic fertilizer to spread among her alfalfa crops, which she will use for animal feed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1239442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

","en":"Yennys is forty-two and lives in the southwest part of the city with her sixteen-year-old daughter, who she dreams will become a successful professional.  Yennys sells charcoal wholesale by the sack and also sells pork by the pound.  She has done this since 2003, when she started her business by selling bread stuffed with corn and cheese at a very well-known commercial site in the city near the traditional restaurants.  This is where she saw the need to supply them with coal, a raw material for these businesses, and she started selling this product and distributing it by the sack.  This is how she started to grow, and today she sells in quantities no less than 100 sacks per week.  She carries this product in a truck and then sells it.

located near Ocean Beach in San Diego. Claytime Ceramics offers hands-on experiences in ceramics painting, mosaic, pottery and clay modeling. Whether alone, in groups or on a romantic date, Caroline\u2019s customers come from all over San Diego to spend a few hours exploring their creativity.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Pakistan, Caroline received a degree in Arts and a Masters in Education. She established her business to provide a creative outlet for the community. She organizes a variety of classes for kids and adults, as well as summer camps that combine time on the beach with indoor arts classes. Furthermore, she collaborates with local schools for fundraisers.\r\n\r\nCaroline has been running Claytime Ceramics for 10 years and has gone through some difficult periods. After her husband died in 2006, she fought to keep her business going through the recent economic downturn, all while having to take care of two small boys without any other support.\r\n\r\nHer $6,000 Kiva loan will allow Caroline to update her website, purchase a new kiln and stock her art supplies, especially for her popular mosaic classes.\r\n\r\nDespite her challenges, Caroline has found her passion and is determined to succeed, daily living out her personal motto: \"Do what you love and you'll never work a day!\"\r\n\r\nFind Claytime Ceramics on the web at:

She is married and the mother to two children, aged nine and five years old. The oldest attends school, and both are her dependents.\r\n\r\nPauline is doing very well, and has been a grain merchant for the past four years. She purchases her supplies from nearby villages, and her clientele is made up of both men and women.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRowena hopes to give her children a good quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

One of them is Mrs. Sarojin, who was selected as their president. The lady in the blue saree sitting first from the left hand side in the photo is Sarojin. Sarojin is 47 years old and is staying with her husband and her two children. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in cultivation for a long time. She got the idea of doing paddy cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighbourhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took on leadership of the group and started to cultivate paddy and sell them in her village. She has very good relationships with her customers as she sells paddy or rice, whichever is required by the customers, on time. Now she has a new idea, which is to lease more land for cultivation so that she can do paddy cultivation on a large scale. For this reason, she has requested a loan to purchase seeds and fertilizers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1239766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizers and pay for leasing farm land ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2012-11-20T07:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-20T07:40:14Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarojin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sukanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhanu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmabati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T15:36:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":497737,"name":"Tamalii","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tamalii is a 30-year-old married woman with 3 children.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, undergarments, etc. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of her family having a good life.

aged 51, is a resident of Tondo, Philippines. She is a widow and a mother to her children. She and her children manage their household while she operates her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCynthia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only the usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two people when buying cooked rice and food costs less than raw ingredients. \r\n\r\nCynthia's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Cynthia to continue operating her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw ingredients like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCynthia hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of having a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1239732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

consumption. He has seven children and has been doing this work for 10 years.  His primary income sources are milk, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Feeding dairy cows to improve their productivity!' His biggest challenge is 'High cost of animal feeds and diseases..' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Lelmet'. He says he will use the loan requested, amounting to 41,600 from Juhudi Kilimo, to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nPatrick was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Because I am a farmer and Juhudi Kilimo offers loans to small-scale farmers to boost their farming activities.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Micro finance is short-term loans given to people who do small-scale farming and businesses.'\r\n\r\nPatrick's highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Patrick replied, 'My children will go to school due to the money from selling milk.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Patrick owns the following: 'cow, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, poultry, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

They have seven children who they raised with great love, and they now live with their granddaughter in a rented house.\r\n\r\nReyna doesn't look after any of her children now, because they have all grown up, and this makes her feel proud. But she and her husband still have to work  to support themselves and raise their granddaughter without any other worries.

During harvest time, she sells her produce in the wholesale market in the city, where she has regular customers. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, her husband receives a pension from the job he did before he retired. Over time, he saved up to buy a car, and now works as a public transport taxi driver between two nearby cities. He has obtained all the necessary licenses and he only needs one more in order to work with peace of mind. The job pays well because he uses his own car, which means he makes more profit. \r\n\r\nReyna belongs to the \"San Lorenzo\" support group, and this is their thirteenth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

Her profits from her business will help her to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs.\r\n\r\nSusana dreams of being able to give her children a good education and hopes to expand her business through all her hard work.

All of Djumakan's children are grown and married. As her main source of income for her family, Djumakan is engaged in field crops and livestock, having started this business 32 years ago with a sum of only 3,000 som (KGS ). Thanks to her hard work, Djumakan today has on her farm four cows and ten heads of sheep. \r\n\r\nThe monthly income of the farm is about 8,000 som (KGS). Similarly, Djumakan works 0.36 hectares of land, where she grows corn, and a 1.85-hectare field where she grows hay that serves as food for the livestock. Djumakan's son and husband help in the business.  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Djumakan appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow and bull for fattening and resale. Djumakan plans to use income from the loan \u0414\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b to further invest in her business.

","en":"Tamarkan is 52 years old, she has raised six children. Tamarkan has been doing animal husbandry as a main source of income for her family, a business which she started 34 years ago with an amount of 4,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Tamarkan now has two cows and two young calves, six goats and her monthly profit from the business is around 10,000 KGS. Her husband and youngest son who is only one from all the children who has still not married help her to run the business. With the goal to further grow her business Tamarkan has come to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 10,000 som to buy seep for feeding and resale. She plans to invest the profit from the loan into development of her business and also this year she wanted to have a total remodeling of her house and get her son married. In the future Tamarkan dreams to buy land for her daughter so that she can build a house for herself and her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1239427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She previously accessed a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for her child\u2019s education and in their personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 40,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and child\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nJasmine hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her child a good future through all her hard work on her business.

The only sitting lady in the photograph is Danda. She is 32, very poor, and lives with her husband, three sons, age 15, 8 and 6, and one daughter, age 13. Her family belongs to the below poverty line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day.\n \nDanda has been running a general store in her small village for seven years with the help of her husband. She sells general grocery items like oil, sugar, lentils, biscuits, and stationery such as books, pens, etc. She was able to increase the varieties of items at her general store with her scanty savings and increase her cash flow. Her monthly cash income from the existing business is around INR 4,000. Apart from this, she also gets some income in kind as the barter system is still prevailed in rural pockets. Out of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses. \n\nAs per the statement, she was able to increase the varieties in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase stock of her business. So the loan amount will be used to purchase items like lentils, oil, soap, washing powder, shampoo, etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she replenishes her stock from the nearest town thrice in a week. Danda hopes to save enough money for building a good house for her family as the present house is very small and congested.\n \nThe other four members of the group are Mamata, Saebani, Sita and Chanchala, who are running an electrical shop, a milk business, and a grocery shop.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of lentils, oil, soap, washing powder, shampoo, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Chhatapipal, Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-20T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-20T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Danda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanchala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saebani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T20:26:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":497066,"name":"Dougouyiriwaton 2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9es majoritairement dans des familles traditionnelles \u00e9largies, les sept femmes du groupe Dougouyiriwaton 2 ont  en moyenne 43 ans et 5 enfants.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profits by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVilma dreams of having a good life and hopes to expand her business through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
