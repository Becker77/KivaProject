He lives in Batumi, with his wife and aunt. Lasha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has their income from a newly-started business in their local town. Lasha has a bakery, where breads are baked and sold in Batumi. The income from this bakery is hardly enough to cover only food and everyday expenses for three people. Because the income is not enough for the family, Lasha decided to start-up a new business with the requested loan.\r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved in the frame of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lasha will purchase an additional local bakery, where he will bake Khachapuri (Georgian \u201ccheese bread\u2019\u2019). This is a very popular traditional food among Georgians. Khachapuri will be sold with the breads from Lasha's first bakery, and this will increase the family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Her experience dates back 6 years to when, taking advantage of her husband working in a company dedicated to raising and selling chickens, she decided to start her own business venture.  Today her principal products are beef, chicken, and cold cuts, which she sells whole or by the pound, on credit or for cash, depending on the customer.  Her principal buyers are the residents of her neighborhood and the largest volume of sales is usually in the month of December during the festivities that take place in the city, such as carnival parties, religious celebrations, etc.    \r\n\r\nCurrently Christmas and the New Year\u2019s holidays are approaching so the demand has increased while her working capital is too diminished to buy a freezer that will permit her to store a larger volume of meat products in optimum conditions and to respond to the increase in her orders during the periods when sales rise.  This is the principal reason for acquiring a Kiva loan, her second through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will buy a freezer with two doors and a larger volume of chickens and meats.

of raw materials like fabric, thread, needles, and other materials needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and in her personal, household, and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 8,000 PHP loan to buy additional supplies of raw materials needed in her business. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nLigaya hopes to increase production and dreams of being able to give her family a good life through all her hard work on her business.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Ofelia's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Ofelia is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nOfelia hopes to expand her business through all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1240009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for groceries, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-20T19:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-20T19:30:08Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ofelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960413},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.02,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095143},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.98,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2056.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484293},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4113.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036805}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T21:01:30Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lindsay Monnet","image":1154816}},{"id":498509,"name":"Bebiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bebiana is a fifty-year-old married woman and a mother of two children from Bien Unido, Bohol.

There she has a small workshop for woven bags and handcrafts made from totumo wood and country-style wood. She learned handcrafting from the time she was very young, because she comes from a family of artisans who work sculpting totumo wood (the fruit of this bush) to sell. Her main products are women's accessories and woven backpacks. She also added another business, which is the production and sale of hayacas, flour or rice dough with meat and vegetables wrapped in leaves from the bijao plant.\r\n\r\nShe sells directly to her customers, who are neighbors and referrals. They generate income that supports her family's well-being. Her goal for the future is to have a workshop to shape the next generation of artisans that will one day export many of these products to the world with the quality necessary for the globalized market. Currently she is applying for a Kiva loan, which is her first financing with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Through it, she will buy thread, wool, hammock fabric, and paints to make handcrafts to order. She also needs to buy supplies to sell Christmas cakes and hayacas such as flour, rice, oil, salt, vegetables, and meat products. She anticipates that her Kiva loan will be a good multipliable investment, because she will do it during one of the most commercial seasons of the year, where everything merchants and producers offer goes quickly in the market at a time when a lot of money changes

To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 2009, having started this business with 7,000 KGS.  The main business focus is selling milk and reselling livestock.  Ainura is a kind and responsive person.  She is the type of person, who will not refuse anything to anyone.  Thanks to her hard work and diligence, today her business contains one dairy cow and five sheep, sugar beats planted on her land, and the monthly income amounts to 4,000 som.  Her husband actively helps her with the business.  In order to further develop her business, Ainura requested a loan in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a dairy cow.  The cow will allow her to increase the sales of milk.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further expansion of her business.

a widow.  She received her portion of the collective farm land after the breakup of the Soviet Union.  To provide the primary source of income, she became involved in animal husbandry and farming in 1998, having started this business with 10,000 som.  Thanks to Patila's hard work, today her business contains one cow and six sheep, and the monthly income from the business amounts to about 10,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Patila requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy sheep for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further increase of domestic livestock quantities and business expansion.

This will increase the taxi's capacity to work extra hours and enable Mahmoud to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve his income positively and ensure to him better future.\r\nMahmoud is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her loan request was always rejected, due to low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nEkaterine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with easier conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Ekaterine will purchase children\u2019s clothing and sell it from the store located at the local fair. She will begin her entrepreneurial activity with a wide assortment of merchandise and high sales volume.   This will increase the family's income. She wants to develop her business further and reinvest the increased income in trading.

He has a repair shop for motorcycles and he also offers his services to repair these vehicles.  His shop has been in business for the past 6 years, when motorcycles began to become more popular as a common means of transportation, and thus created a need for preventative maintenance, upgrade vehicles, make repairs, and find parts.\r\n\r\nThe first things he did when he opened his business was to count the number of motorcycles that passed by his location and the number of other repair shops around him, and he perceived that the point of a shop was to work well and decided to get advice from his nephew, who knew a lot about the subject.  That's how he began his family business, and little by little, he has grown his customer base, so that he is now known throughout the area.  He sells brakes, tubing, Stop brand belts, brake fluid, chains, bulbs, and more.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for his second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the first, he was able to buy a larger number of parts and grow his business through a new inventory selection.  With his current micro-loan, he will invest in buying tires for the motorcycles in bulk quantities, since this is the part in greatest demand in his business, and with these he will be able to increase once more the volume of his sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1240578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

He is married with four children, all are in school.\r\n\r\nHe has a seed nursery and a primary school which helps orphans to access an education at subsidized rates. He started in 2010 with eight pupils, but now he has a population of 150 pupils.

She works as an accountant at a publishing house in the city of Novaya Kahovka. Yana got married not long ago, and she and her husband moved to their own apartment. The apartment has been in need of repair for a long time, but the young family has not had the necessary funds to repair it. \r\n\r\nYana turned to Kiva for a loan in the amount of 8,000 hryvnia for personal purposes. She did not have enough money of her own to change three windows and windowsills in the apartment, and further to set up a balcony. After the cold came, and the apartment became significantly colder, this need became more pressing for the whole of Yana's family. Therefore she decided to stop postponing the repair and make use of Kiva's financial services, and thereby making the family's life easier and create comfort in the house.

His business goal is to run a big cereal store business selling a variety of cereals within five years. This is his fifth loan with SMEP DTM. Previously, he took a loan of 80,000 which he paid well.

She lives in the city of Ica with her father, in the district of Santiago. She loves her father and is thankful to all the support he has brought her. She is a very friendly, hard working and enthusiastic woman who has a great desire to get ahead. Unfortunately, Leonela could not study for an agronomy degree like she had hoped because she has had to work since she was very young to support her parents with their household expenses. In her free time she likes to watch television and often cooks delicious \"chicharrones\" to share with her family. \r\n\r\nUpon her own initiative and with much perseverance and dedication, Leonela works in her small business selling snacks. She works every day from early in the morning and spends about 12 hours working. She is happy working and believes that it is going well for her because of the friendliness with which she serves her customers. \r\n\r\nLeonela is very thankful to the Kiva lenders because she will be able to buy her merchandise with the help brought to her. These include snacks, soda and ice cream, among other items. In this way, Leonela will have a well stocked business. She hopes to increase her sales and soon hopes to have a better stocked store so that she can continue working to achieve her greatest dream of having her own house.

Desde muy peque\u00f1o el c\u00f3nyuge de Melvis trabaj\u00f3 en el mar con su padre y cuando Melvis y \u00e9l, formaron su propia familia, ella aprendi\u00f3 a elaborar esta herramienta de pesca, la que posteriormente se convirtiera en su negocio, por eso hoy  se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n y reparaci\u00f3n de trasmallos, atarrayas y tambi\u00e9n genera ingresos mediante el comercio de ropa en esta misma poblaci\u00f3n de clientes. En el medio de los pescadores, antiguos compa\u00f1eros de los esposos de Melvis, ella es muy reconocida y es all\u00ed donde se encuentra en sus principales y fieles clientes, que le llevan atarrayas y trasmallos, para que esta los repare y quedaran listos  una semana despu\u00e9s. Melvis diariamente se acomoda en su acostumbrada silla,  empieza a entretejer entre hilos de nylon, utilizando agujas elaboradas en PVC, que algunas veces compra, mientras otras su esposo  las elabora para ella. En este mismo mercado ha conocido muchas personas y tambi\u00e9n les vende ropa exterior e interior y esta vez quiere contar con mucha existencia de mercanc\u00eda, porque se acerca la navidad y el a\u00f1o nuevo y las familias ya han encargado la ropa que lucir\u00e1n en estas fiestas llenas de alegr\u00eda y muy familiares. As\u00ed Melvis se ha acercado a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo para solicitar un credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 materia primas e insumos para  tejer y tambi\u00e9n comprar\u00e1  la ropa que vestir\u00e1n sus clientes en las fiestas mas lindas del a\u00f1o.  ","en":"Melvis, 28, is the mother of two children, ages 9 and 12.  She and her husband have a goal of getting them ahead and seeing them become professionals so they have the potential for success in the future.\r\n\r\nMelvis's husband worked in the ocean with his father from a very young age.  When he and Melvis started their own family, she learned to make this fishing tool, which later she would turn into a business.   That's why today she works making and repairing trammel nets and fishnets.  She also generates income with a clothing business in this same community of customers.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the fishermen, old friends of Melvis's husband, she's very well known, and that's where she finds her main and most loyal customers.  They bring her fishnets and trammel nets, which she'll repair and have ready for them a week later.\r\n\r\nEvery day Melvis gets comfortable in her customary chair and begins to weave with nylon thread, using needles made of PVC that sometimes she buys, sometimes her husband makes for her.  In this same market she has met a lot of people, and she also sells them clothing and underwear.  This time she wants to have a lot of merchandise because Christmas and New Year are coming and families have already ordered the clothes they'll look good in for these holidays that are full of happiness and family.\r\n\r\nSo Melvis approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to request a Kiva loan with which she'll buy raw materials and supplies to weave.  She'll also buy the clothing that her customers will wear during the most beautiful celebrations of the year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1240589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials and supplies for weaving and to buy clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-11-21T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-21T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melvis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":73950},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":74898},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":76646},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78434},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80264},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82137},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84054},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":86015},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88022},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90076},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92178},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":93326}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.9,"local_amount":187089,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":187737.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130863},{"amount":30.6,"local_amount":55642,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":55834.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071562},{"amount":33.66,"local_amount":61197,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":61409.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497780},{"amount":44.15,"local_amount":80264,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80542.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527584},{"amount":37.05,"local_amount":67365,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67598.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323280},{"amount":301.64,"local_amount":548443,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":550344.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732291}],"funded_date":"2012-11-21T02:19:08Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":498889,"name":"Adalicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adalicia con su previo credikiva compr\u00f3 mateias primas con los que respondi\u00f3 a sus pedidos de uniformes escolares y tambien le alcanz\u00f3 hasta para comprar una vitrina.

The loan will be used to buy more fresh food like matooke [steamed green banana, or plantain], sweet potatoes and cassava for resale and will help Pheginina to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Pheginina hopes that she will be able to build a big house for herself in the future.\r\n\r\nPheginina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Together they have one daughter, Magaly, who is 17. They live in their own home located in a rural annex of the central forest. Gladys is of fragile appearance but is very hard-working. Her zone is favorable for producing good quality coffee beans. Her fertile lands are appropriate and good for producing coffee with a good aroma. It is for that reason that every weekend she and her husband care for their coffee plantings. They have already been working at this for 16 years, and as mentioned their coffee is very well known in the Alto Palomar cooperative, where they sell their harvest each agricultural season. She comments that they always have a tree nursery, from which they renovate their older plantings. Now they have 3000 little plants in the process of germinating; with them they hope to have new and better coffee beans. Their nearest goals are to tend their plantings, since next year she hopes to have a good harvest, because she has confidence in their effort. For this, she needs support to acquire what is necessary so that this will be possible. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Prestatarios de la Uni\u00f3n Palomar\" (Borrowers of Palomar Union), and this is her second loan with MFP, where she hopes to advance with the support of her communal bank, those who will work hard to advance.\r\n\r\nWith the money Gladys will be able to pay the day laborers to clean her plantings.

Uganda. For the past six years, Janiffer has been working hard to manage her small market stall where she sells fresh food such as matooke.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Janiffer has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food like matooke, sweet potatoes, and cassava to sell. This will help Janiffer to generate greater profits, allowing her to pay school fees for her young sister. Janiffer hopes that she will be able to buy a vehicle in the future.\r\n\r\nJaniffer is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1240354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Fansta is 21 years old and lives in the town of Hima in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, of whom two are currently in school. For the past 3 years, Fansta has been working hard to manage her small market stall, in which she sells fresh food like matooke (green plantains, or a meal made when they are steamed).\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Fansta has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food like matooke, sweet potatoes, and cassava for resale. This will help Fansta to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children and to pay for medical bills. Fansta hopes that in the future she will be able to educate her children up to university level and also to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nFansta is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1240402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

For the past 2 years, Penina has been working hard to manage her small market stall, in which she sells fresh food like matooke (green plantains, or a meal made when they are steamed). \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Penina has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food like matooke, sweet potatoes, and cassava for resale, and will help Penina to generate greater profits and pay for medical bills. Penina hopes that in the future she will be able to build a big house for herself and also start rearing animals like goats and cows.\r\n\r\nPenina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The loan will be used to buy more plastic items such as cups and plates that will be sold in the shop.  This will help Jane to generate greater profits and to pay for her medical bills.  Jane hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and to build a house. \r\n\r\nJane is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Hawa was born in Makeni City 35 years ago.

Responsible Ones) 1, 2 & 4. She lives in a simple structure with her four children and their father. She is a hard-working and dedicated woman who works to help her family by bringing in extra income. \r\n\r\nCelia is excited to be taking her seventh loan with Esperanza, after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for about nine years, starting off with her own savings after working in different jobs. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by all different styles of shoes, for women, men and kids.

She is friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic. Together with her husband they work hard to get their family ahead. Unfortunately, due to the need to work from a very young age to support her parents, Catalina was not able to study a career, but she would have liked to have done so. In her free time she likes to cook a delicious meal of Pallares con Seco [Lima beans with dried meat] to share with her family.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of hard work and enthusiasm, some years ago Catalina began farming. She has a small piece of land where she grows grapes. Every day she starts work very early, with help from her husband. She works about 10 hours a day and thinks it's going well because of her enthusiasm and dedication to her work. \r\n\r\nCatalina is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their support she will be able to cover the costs of maintenance, irrigation and harvesting of her crop.

He describes himself as focused and business-oriented man. He has run a farm for five years where  he grows and sells kale. His business is located on agricultural land, and his primary customers are local residents. \r\n\r\nAlfred says his biggest business challenge is insufficient funds for improving his business. He will use the 11,100 Kenyan Shilling (KES) loan to purchase a water tank, which will be used by his five family members.

They have a beautiful daughter named Angelis who is three years old.  They live in a house they own located in a rural area. Chriss is a young woman of deep convictions.  She works in agriculture.  It's hard work to do seeding, fertilizing and harvest, a commitment Chriss took on 10 years ago; according to her she liked the land and rural life since she was little, she now has more than two hectares of land where she plants bananas and harvests twice a month.  What she likes the most is to be able to negotiate her delicious bananas through third parties; who gladly advise her about new markets where she can expand to and offer her fruit.  This is why later on she wants to be recognized as a good farmer. A year ago she also got a plot of land with coffee, she takes good care of it to harvest and sell.  With her husband's help she is confident she will achieve her goals.  She belongs to the community bank \"Unity becomes strength for the doves\" and this is the third loan with MFP, where she hopes to get ahead together with the community bank with members committed to move forward.  With the money from the loan she will buy several bags of organic fertilizer to take care of her plantations of bananas and coffee.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1240726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy bags of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-21T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-21T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chriss","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":207.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":231.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":239.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":236.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":257.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":267.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":277.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":283.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":745.94,"local_amount":1925.01,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1946.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053873},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":74.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":75.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974503}],"funded_date":"2012-11-21T06:54:57Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":498970,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma is 66 years old and married with ten children.

Their 15-year-old daughter, Merly, is the only one who still lives at home.  They own the home they live in which is next to the central forest.\r\n\r\nCarmen is very dynamic and active in her work.  For nine years she has been farming crops, with the main ones being coffee, bananas and avocado.  What she enjoys most is removing the weeds that grow constantly, because that ensures her crops can grow better.  The daily hard work she puts into growing bananas means she must travel twice a month to the cities of La Merced and Villa Rica where she sells her produce.  But since she knows the coffee harvest season is only once a year she wants to improve and expand into growing different crops so she does not run into economic problems.  Now she is preparing to harvest the last coffee beans that she hopes will give her a good profit.  She plans to hire workers to take care of the crops.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"La uni\u00f3n hace la fuerza del palomar\" and this is her third loan through MFP.

She owns four motor-taxis that she rents to different drivers who come to the house to hire their working vehicle.  The income she earns from this allows her to cover basic household expenses.  Sometimes it is her own children or brothers who drive the vehicles and other times it is neighborhood youth who she knows very well.  All of her vehicles are kept in good condition, but the circulation permit on some of them is about to expire.  \r\n\r\nShe has been in business for 20 years and started out from scratch with a lot of optimism and determination.  What she likes most about her work is that it allows her to spend time with the family and take care of other household activities.  She also generates extra income for the daily running of the household.  Business has been going well until now, so she hopes to continue in this vein and expand her fleet.\r\n\r\nThis is her 11th loan through MFP and she is grateful for the financial support she receives there, which helps her to continue increasing her work capital.

He is a third-year law student at the Tajik State University.  Jahongir is one of the more successful students and he actively participates in student life at the university.

is a rural villager from Takeo Province's Samrong District where silk weaving is a popular business in the neighborhood.

Sokha is a silk weaver and a grocery seller in the local area while her husband is a rice farmer on one hectare of farmland to tackle the family's difficulties. \r\n\r\nHaving been engaged in this business for 25 years, Sokha is able to save up to five US dollars per day from her current business after deducting the expenses. This is Sokha's second-cycle loan with Kiva's partner, VisionFund. The previous business loan, which she successfully repaid, helped her to sustain her living conditions as well as gradually helping her business. \r\n\r\nIn this loan cycle, she is applying for an education loan of 1,600 US dollars to cover the entire tuition fees for four years for her oldest son, an 18-year-old freshman specializing in finance and banking at a local university. Sokha very much hopes that this loan will enable her to send her oldest son to university. That will also help her son to obtain a higher education background so that he can get a good job after graduation in order to support the family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1240838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
