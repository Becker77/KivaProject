In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJonjie hopes her children will finish their studies and dreams of expanding her business through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She is married to Rolando, a laborer at a construction site, and is a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMary Grace operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two people when buying cooked rice and food costs less than raw food. Mary Grace also has a direct selling business to earn additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operating her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. Mary Grace will be utilizing the loan to buy more raw ingredients like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMary Grace hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of providing her children with a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1240842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She has experienced drivers who arrive at her house very early to get the vehicles they drive through the streets of the city.\r\n\r\nShe has been in this business for more than 10 years and it's going very well for her because she has a fixed daily income that helps her cover the basic household expenses.  She works supervising the taxis with the help of her brother, a mechanic who provides all the necessary mechanical assistance.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her job is that she can organize her time and spend her free time as she likes.  She says this way she's a capable and independent woman.  She hopes to continue working and carrying out her duties to the best of her ability.  Her big desire is to set up a formal and more productive business in the food sector in her own house.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.

con la venta de bollos y productos fritos empacados y en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su prima; posteriormente los conductores de los buses, le pidieron que agregara pasteles y desde entonces su principal producto es justamente este. En su proceso de compras es apoyada por su esposo y la parte productiva la realiza ella misma, as\u00ed que se dedica diariamente a picar la verdura, sazonar la carne, hierve el agua, a la que agrega sal y posteriormente en hojas de bijao (arbusto)  envuelve la masa de arroz o harina mezclada con verduras y carnes,  asegur\u00e1ndola  cada una con pita y someti\u00e9ndola a cocci\u00f3n por varias horas, para luego enfriarla de manera natural.

She lives in Cartagena with her husband and she has 6 children ranging from 14 to 37 years old. She sells pies and skewered meat, generating an income which allows her to help with the household expenses.  \r\n\r\nOver the 11 years she has been in this business, Carmi\u00f1a has learnt to make the right investments in keeping with the times and as such, her business has grown. She started out selling bread rolls, crisps and snacks outside the city's public transport terminals with her cousin. The bus conductors then asked her to sell pies as well, and these subsequently became her main product. \r\n\r\nCarmi\u00f1a's husband helps her to buy supplies while she is in charge of preparing the food and selling it. Everyday she chops vegetables, seasons the meat, and boils the water, adding a little salt. She then mixes the vegetable and meat together with rice or flour and wraps it in bijao tree leaves and ties each bundle with twine. It is cooked for several hours, after which it is unwrapped and fried. \r\n\r\nCarmi\u00f1a's pies are very well-cooked which is why her clients return time and again to buy them, especially for parties and at weekends. She also sells snacks, juices and drinks for cash or credit to restaurants and in the community where she lives. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is applying for her first kiva loan with which she will buy wholesale staple goods such as rice, meat products, crisps and snacks, drinks and other supplies in order to meet demand for the end of the year. This is the time of year when she sells the most pies which means her kiva loan will be a success.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1241388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy staple foods such as rice, meat, crisps and snacks, drinks and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-11-21T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-21T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmi\u00f1a ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83738},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90825},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92944},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95113},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":97332},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":99604},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":101928},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104306},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":106740},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109230},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118240}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.6},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":83738,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":86424.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130865},{"amount":51.6,"local_amount":90825,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":93738.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519728},{"amount":52.81,"local_amount":92944,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":95925.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071568},{"amount":54.04,"local_amount":95113,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":98164.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497785},{"amount":55.31,"local_amount":97332,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":100454.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527590},{"amount":56.59,"local_amount":99604,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":102799.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928352},{"amount":57.91,"local_amount":101928,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":105198.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705506},{"amount":249.16,"local_amount":438516,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":452585.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967796}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T15:52:24Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Hewitt","image":null}},{"id":499437,"name":"Estevana Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Estevana con su credikiva anterior invirti\u00f3 en la compra de una vitrina calentadora e insumos, con los cuales prepar\u00f3 papas rellenas, deditos, arepuelas, empanadas carima\u00f1olas(Producto  frito preparado con masa de yuca y rellenos de carne, o pollo) que vendi\u00f3  agilmente.

Siendo sede de importantes batallas y asentamiento relevante, especialmente durante la Guerra de Arauco, por estar en la frontera con territorio mapuche. Actualmente la ciudad posee un importante desarrollo econ\u00f3mico y demogr\u00e1fico, llegando a ser considerada como uno de los n\u00facleos urbanos, demogr\u00e1fico, administrativo, financiero y comercial m\u00e1s relevantes de Chile, despu\u00e9s de Santiago y Valpara\u00edso.\n\n\n\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cEl Esfuerzo de Santa Juana\u201d and it has 17 enterprising members who are in a variety of lines of work among which are fabric sales, barber shop, warehouse, candy sales, perfume sales, fast-food sales, cosmetics sales and services, among others.  All of them are from the city of Concepci\u00f3n.\r\n\r\nNubia\u2019s a member of the communal bank.  In the photo she\u2019s standing third from right to left, wearing blue jeans and a lilac shirt.  She\u2019s got a black purse and is carrying a piece of paper in her hand.  Her hair is dark brown and she wears it long and loose.\r\n\r\nHer line of work for the last year has been leasing out children\u2019s pedal cars.  She comments that she works in squares during the afternoon and sometimes her husband and her son help her.  During the summer her clientele increases and she doesn\u2019t have enough cars to rent so the children can have fun.  She rents them for ten minutes at a time at prices that are adequate for her clientele.\r\n\r\nMerchandise she needs she buys in the city of Santiago from suppliers and low-cost vendors which is advantageous economically.  She will use the loan to buy a little pedal car for the children\u2019s amusement.  One of Nubia\u2019s goals is to acquire more little cars to lease in order to have a better quality of life and provide wellbeing for her family.\r\n\r\nNubia lives with her husband and two children who are 15 and 7 years of age and are attending school.  Her dream on a work level is to have a well-established business and to open a few branches to generate higher income.  She\u2019s very happy and grateful for the support provided by Fondo Esperanza because she\u2019ll be able to invest in her business.  She comments that the training has been fundamental for her business and also for her personal development since she\u2019s learned how to organize and manager her income and investments better.\r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n is located at the mouth of the Biob\u00edo River, one of the country\u2019s largest, in southern Chile\u2019s Biob\u00edo region.  It\u2019s played an important historical role as a site of important battles and a relevant settlement, especially during the Arauco War, because it borders Mapuche territory.  The city currently has important economic and population development and is considered to be one of the most relevant Chilean urban, demographic, administrative, financial and commercial nucleuses after Santiago and Valpara\u00edso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3575,"image":{"id":1240628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Entertainment","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"to

She is 25 years old, is married, and lives with her family: her husband, brother-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law and 3-year-old son. \r\n\r\nMaya has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salaries of Maya\u2019s husband and brother-in-law, who work as soldiers. Maya distributes cosmetics among her neighbors and has a small income. According to Credo estimations, Maya\u2019s family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nMaya requested a loan from Credo to start up a trade business of clothing sales. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nMaya will purchase clothes in Tbilisi for wholesale prices and resell them in her town for a profit.

For the past two years, Ahmad has had a mobile phone store. He has a good reputation between customers, so he has many loyal clients who request and buy modern mobiles. This makes Ahmad's project a profitable one and the only source of income to him, but also it needs more support from time to time to cover the cost of bringing in a modern collection of mobiles.\r\n\r\nAhmad is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a collection of mobile phones. This will attract more customers and increase Ahmad's income and insure him a better future.\r\n\r\nAhmad is photographed inside his store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Y esto es justamente la raz\u00f3n de que su credikiva sea exitoso. ","en":"Alejandra, 34, learned to work with food from her aunt because she has always enjoyed kitchen work. When she decided to earn income through a business selling food, her partner was the first one to support her with the initial capital. In this way she has succeeded in growing her business and in earning income, with which she supports her household consisting of her husband, a bricklayer, and their two children, aged 3 and 10 years. In her business, she sells fried meat products such as pig, chorizo, rennet, entrails, etc. at a shop located in her house. She waits on customers from 8 in the morning until 9 at night. This is how customers eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at Alejandra's business. The location of this business improves its sales, since it is located near a soccer field where many sportspeople meet, especially on weekends and holidays. Alejandra's main goal is to expand, but her challenge is not having sufficient capital and work to achieve that as soon as she dreams of doing. Because of this, she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She wants to take advantage of the fact that the end of year holidays are approaching to invest in raw materials and increase her sales volume, because it is at this time of year that she has more customers than usually come to her business.

He lives with his family and has owned a barbershop for the past year. This is his only source of income. Mohammad's shop is located in the central market of the city where there is good movement of customers. Mohammad has many loyal clients, which makes his business a profitable one, but it needs more support to cover some necessary costs.\r\n\r\nMohammad is requesting a loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a chair and shaving machine for his barbershop. Taking this loan will improve Mohammad's work in the barbershop, which will satisfy his clients and increase their demand.  This will increase Mohammad's income and insure him a bright future.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Su idea de negocio fue impulsada por sus padres desde muy joven y cuando decidi\u00f3 emprender su propia aventura empresarial una amiga la apoy\u00f3, empezando juntas a confeccionar para sus mas cercanas amistades y familiares. En su negocio Maria desarrolla todas las operaciones de la confecci\u00f3n, desde el dise\u00f1o, pasando por el corte, la preparaci\u00f3n el ensamble y acabado de piezas;  con la calidad con la que trabaja  Maria, unida a  su capacidad de aprendizaje en diversas l\u00edneas de productos, Maria ha logrado consolidar un mercado entre habitantes del sector y algunas cl\u00ednicas,  donde sus clientes la han referido. En la actualidad est\u00e1 vendiendo principalmente a cr\u00e9dito y en la medida en que crece su mercado, el capital de trabajo es insuficiente para responder a pedidos, esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mari Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 insumos para fabricar ropa de cama, cortinas y lencer\u00eda.

","en":"Maria, 42 years old, makes women's clothing. She also makes home linens and curtains. She lives south of the city with her husband and her daughter, 20 years old, whom she dreams of seeing become a successful professional. Her business idea was inspired by her parents when she was very young, and when she decided to develop her own entrepreneurial adventure, a friend supported her. Together they started to make items for their closest friends and family members. Maria does all of the production work in her business, from the design through the cutting, preparation, assembly, and finishing of pieces. With the quality of Maria's work and her capacity for learning about various product lines, she has succeeded in building up a market among residents of the area and some clinics, where her customers have referred her. Currently, she is selling mainly on credit, and with the degree to which her market is growing, the working capital is insufficient to respond to orders. This is why she is taking out a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy supplies to make bed linens, curtains, and home linens. Her greatest potential for success with this investment is her 7 years of experience, during which she has built up a clientele and learned when to invest, as she will do now with her Kiva loan at the end of the year. It is a time of holidays, when families make many changes to their homes in order to meet Christmas and the new year very up-to-date and with many dreams and hopes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1241551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies to make bed linens, curtains, and home linens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-11-21T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-21T21:10:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":116790},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":149070},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":152549},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":156108},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":159751},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":163478},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167293},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":171196},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175191},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":179279},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":183462},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225833}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.69,"local_amount":116790,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":119331.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519734},{"amount":83.86,"local_amount":149070,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":152314.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071573},{"amount":85.81,"local_amount":152549,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":155868.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497791},{"amount":87.81,"local_amount":156108,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":159505.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527597},{"amount":89.86,"local_amount":159751,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":163227.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928358},{"amount":91.95,"local_amount":163478,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":167035.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705511},{"amount":94.1,"local_amount":167293,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":170933.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967802},{"amount":96.3,"local_amount":171196,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":174921.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817006},{"amount":98.55,"local_amount":175191,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":179003.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323289},{"amount":331.07,"local_amount":588574,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":601382.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082544}],"funded_date":"2012-11-24T15:17:19Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:04:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":499265,"name":"Haja","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 38-year-old Haja from Kandeh town in the southern area, Bo.

This will ensure better and healthy living conditions to Ashraf and his family.\r\n\r\nAshraf is photographed in the store where he purchased the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is married to a businessman and blessed with four children between the ages of 5 and 23 years. Three are currently attending school. In 1999, Maseray established a business selling plastic slippers. She began her business in order to generate income to educate her children. She works at the business six days per week.  Her major business challenge is the cost of transportation from the place where she purchases her goods to her town in Bo. \r\n\r\nMaseray requires a loan in order to buy more plastic slippers. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to send one of her children to university and start a savings account. In the future, Maseray plans to open a big slipper store.

In 2007, after learning how to run a business from her mother, she opened a general store where she now works every day, from morning to night. Her main business challenge is a lack of capital with which to operate and stock her store. Joyah is requesting a loan to buy clothing and palm oil to sell to her customers. She hopes that the extra income she earns from this this loan will allow her to educate her children and start a savings account. In the future, Joyah hope to open a big clothing store.

He is 21 years old, single and lives with his mother. He earns a living as a farmer, and owns a plot of land where he grows apples, tomatoes and green beans. He sells his produce in the local open market. He also runs a small dairy farm with two calves and two milk cows, and uses their milk to make products he sells locally.

Her loan request was rejected every time because of her low income and the family's poor living conditions. Currently, the family's only source of income is their agricultural business. Specifically, Madona has a cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. Madona sells the cheese locally in an open market at a good price. This activity provides hardly enough food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMadona's loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing credit with soft conditions for start-up and restart-up businesses to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. Madona requested a loan from Credo to purchase an additional milk cow. After purchasing the cow, she will be able to increase her cheese production, which will significantly increase the family's income and improve their living

She says at present her business is doing well because she is the only one with a food stand in the area, so customers prefer buying her goods rather than going to the big market. \r\n\r\nMariama requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone to develop her business by purchasing more rice, dry fish, pepper, onions and palm oil. She says that the extra income from this loan will help her improve her family\u2019s living conditions and renovate her house.

Alaa is a hard worker who puts much effort into improving his business so that he can increase his income and improve his family's living conditions. He is applying for his second youth loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua in order to buy materials for his business, including cups, spoons and bags, in addition to sugar and other items.

She\u2019s a very kind, hardworking, enthusiastic person who focuses all her efforts into moving her little girl forward since she\u2019s both mother and father to her.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of economic resources and the need to work from an early age, Karen was unable to study Accounting but would very much have liked to do so.  In her free time she enjoys watching cartoons with her little girl and sometimes cooks a delicious \u201cArroz con Pollo\u201d (Chicken with Rice) to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, with much effort and dedication and with her parents\u2019 support, Karen works in her small business selling groceries.  She works every day starting very early in the morning and can do so for about 10 hours.  Karen feels good doing her work and believes she does well because of the gracious customer service she provides.\r\n\r\nKaren is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support provided she will be able to buy merchandise like rice, oil, sugar, milk, vegetables, beverages and other basic staples to stock her store.  In this way, Karen will have the store better stocked and thus be able to increase sales and income that will be very useful for her to gradually reach her great dream of having a house of her own.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1241675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"GUADALUPE","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Keren Elizabet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":73.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":78.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":84.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":99.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":103.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.94,"local_amount":73.71,"processed_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":77.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954988},{"amount":32.05,"local_amount":78.87,"processed_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":83.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089453},{"amount":32.97,"local_amount":81.16,"processed_date":"2013-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":85.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478979},{"amount":34.35,"local_amount":84.56,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031654},{"amount":36.59,"local_amount":90.07,"processed_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":95.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776145},{"amount":37.31,"local_amount":91.85,"processed_date":"2013-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482959},{"amount":39.05,"local_amount":96.11,"processed_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":101.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889011},{"amount":40.51,"local_amount":99.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":105.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381663937},{"amount":42.23,"local_amount":103.96,"processed_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":109.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390774902}],"funded_date":"2012-11-22T17:29:40Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":499312,"name":"Tumaini Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is a member of Tumaini Group in Lugari District.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her inventory. \r\n\r\nTeresita hopes to help her grandchildren finish college and dreams that her business will continue to grow. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

His father worked as a contractor in the transportation industry and his mother was also an entrepreneur for several years. \r\n\r\nBefore operating Valet Transportation, a wheelchair and non-emergency transportation business, Shannon compared the necessities and possible risks with his family\u2019s experience. A graduate from The University of Texas at San Antonio, Shannon says, \u201cMy father and I felt confident that we would be successful.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn May 2012, Shannon and his parents began the business, offering reduced rates and \u201cincreased quality care.\u201d  He says because they have a small number of clients and one van, he and his family can offer more personalized customer service. \r\n\r\nValet Transportation doesn\u2019t have a website or social media page but runs completely off word of mouth and direct marketing. \u201cWe have an agreement with nursing homes and an emergency transportation business which calls us when they have overflow,\u201d Shannon says. \r\n\r\nA client can pay $200 to $300 for a stretcher van, which is how most emergency vehicles work, since they may not be equipped with wheelchair harnesses or ramps.  His company charges $80 round-trip in an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) certified van equipped with wheelchair necessities.\r\n\r\nShannon found out about Accion Texas Inc. six years ago during a UTSA seminar about how to generate operating income. \u201cI never deleted that number from my phone,\u201d Shannon says. The loan will repair the van and be used as cash flow. \u201cWe bill the nursing homes and they take 30-90 days to get to us,\u201d Shannon says. \u201cOur invoices show we make a monthly profit, but we don\u2019t see it until they pay.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe loan eased the family\u2019s financial worries and freed them to complete preventive maintenance. Shannon says, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been able to obtain more clients without these procedures. We would have had to wait two to three months before making that money ourselves.\u201d \r\n\r\nValet Transportation also provides services to grocery stores, clinics, pharmacies and any other places their clients need to go. \u201cOur service is a lot cheaper than calling a cab,\u201d Shannon says. \u201cOur clients rely on us instead of other means.\u201d \r\n\r\nShannon\u2019s goal is to purchase another van and employ two full-time drivers by summer 2013. Without the help of an Accion loan, Shannon would need to wait before extending services, and would have to pay out of pocket for daily operating expenses. \r\n\r\nShannon says, \u201cI had a good experience with Accion. The rate we got was a lot lower than expected.\u201d

All four active women entrepreneurs in this group belong to Bhawanipatna town in the Kalahandi district in Odisha, India. Kalahandi district is a very poor region of the country with poverty and underdevelopment. Rashmirani, standing second from the right with a red-colored sari in the photo, is one of the members of this group. She is 26 years of age and lives with her husband, her four-year-old son, father and mother-in-law. \r\n\r\nRashmirani has been running a fabrication workshop for the last 13 years in a temporary shed with the active participation of her husband, who looks after all activities of the business. She has engaged three skilled workers in her fabrication works @ 3,000 INR each per month. She manufactures grills, shutters, windows, doors and other iron products per the orders of the customers. Her monthly net income from the fabrication work is around 5,000 to 6,000 INR. In her opinion, her present income is insufficient to manage the fabrication as well as household expenses. Her husband purchases iron materials from the local market regularly as needed. \r\n\r\nWith the present loan, she is planning to purchase iron rods, angles, and iron sheets in bulk to save the unnecessary expenses incurred due to price fluctuation of the materials and transportation. With this, she will earn some extra income for her family. Rashmirani has a dream of providing a better education for her child and constructing a good workshop for her fabrication unit in the near future. Also, she has a big hope of constructing a house of her own in due course.  \r\n \r\nThe other three members of her group are Gitanjali, Niharika and Kuni who are running a vegetable farm, an electrical shop and a shoe business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1241347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase iron rods, angles, and iron sheets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhawanipatna,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T05:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T05:30:11Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gitanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niharika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rashmirani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":144000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":144000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-24T08:19:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":499495,"name":"Enrique","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seventeen years ago, Enrique began his career as a truck driver.

Aside from this she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan.

She later joined Mary Kay, a wholesale beauty supply company. She was drawn to it because of the product quality and the 50 percent discount on inventory purchases.  \r\n\r\nFor three years now, Ofelia has worked as an independent Mary Kay consultant in Metairie, LA. \r\n\r\nIn her hometown, Ofelia learned the art of the retail sale by selling gold jewelry, which she often still sells. With the assistance of other Mary Kay consultants, Ofelia learned more about her new products and company.\r\n\r\nOfelia has a team of four consultants. She says the Accion Texas Inc. loan helped her business, especially considering she couldn\u2019t receive the assistance from a traditional bank. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional,\u201d she says. \r\n\r\nMary Kay offers Ofelia the opportunity to advance professionally. But without the Accion loan, purchasing the inventory needed to make sales would have been much more challenging.\r\n\r\nA friend who was a previous Accion client told her about the non-profit microlender, so she applied. The Accion lending team helped her understand the application and underwriting process at every turn and she was approved for a loan. \u201cIt was great working with Accion,\u201d she says. \r\n\r\nThe loan helps Ofelia make product information sheets and purchase inventory and miscellaneous materials to create appealing prizes for current clients. These items include bags, tissue paper, baskets and small products for current clients. Without an Accion loan, Ofelia says, \u201cI would have been able to purchase the inventory, but it would have been hard.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the Mary Kay products Ofelia offers, visit

The literal meaning of \"Golngai\" can be closely translated as \u201cbesotted friend\u201d. These tribal women belong to Kholep village of Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. In order to empower themselves and contribute to their family incomes, they mean to help one another to get a loan as a group.\r\n\r\nHevei is pictured with her hand raised. She is 38 years old and a mother to three sons and one daughter. Her husband, Seikhohao, earns money as a wood cutter. With a tight budget, they barely manage their children's schooling. She grows a homestead garden for food. Before she got a loan, she would work doing anything for a day\u2019s wage. There are times when she has to baby-sit and wash clothes to get paid. The nature of her work as a wage earner began to have an adverse effect on the children. Since then, to protect her children's emotions, she got a loan to make a difference in their lives.\r\n\r\nWith part of her first loan, she bought piglets and yarn to weave. She weaved three shawls in a month. With her second loan, she continued her activities and she was happy that she actually earned more than her previous daily wages. She actually bought a TV using her income, which made her children very proud. She said, \u201cThe day I bought the TV, I felt like I was on top of the world. It may sound funny for others but for me and my family it is a great achievement\u201d. Eventually, her activities became the source of the family income. She has contacts and plans to supply the woven shawls and wrap-round at a large scale to retailers of the same products.       \r\n\r\nShe needs and requested another loan from Kiva to improve upon her weaving activities. She wishes to continue weaving for her main source of income. She plans to utilize the loan to purchase one handloom (a simple machine to weave) and to buy yarn of varied quality to weave. Raising pigs is a long-term profit source, which she conveniently wishes to continue. This can serve as a backup plan for any emergency.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members, too, need and requested another loan to do better with their income-generating activities. The group is very happy to know that their loan comes from all around the world. The members pray for God\u2019s blessing for everyone who has lent their money to make a difference in their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1238126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase one handloom (a simple machine to weave) and buy yarn of varied quality to weave","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hevei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneihat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinkholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neipi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoimong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-22T12:07:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":499621,"name":"Felecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felecia is 62 years old and lives in Misom, Baliangao.

The more items displayed in the store the better as more items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her child\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nAnnalisa hopes her business will grow in the coming years and she dreams of giving her family a good future through her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups of 15 to 30 that meet weekly.
