She earns her living by operating three business ventures: the selling of chicken barbeque, a general store and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Nilo, who is 31 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living.  They have two children who are 8 and 12 years old. Ma. Louella joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Louella has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000, with which she intends to purchase additional stock for her business so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and for home repairs. Ma. Louella is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

He is a very kind and hard-working man who lives in his own home together with his wife, 28 year-old Virginia, and his five beloved children who he would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, Guido takes a lot of care in working his land and making it fertile since he knows that the quality of his coffee plantations and avocado trees depends on it.  After harvesting his crops, Guido takes them to the market in the town of Pichanaki to sell.  What he most enjoys about his work is the fact that he has a lot of freedom to work on his land since he can make use of his own time and capital.  He has been in this business for 10 years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be weeding his coffee plantations.\r\n\r\nOver time, Guido would like to buy more land so that he can increase his production.  This is his first loan with MFP and he feels capable of making all his loan repayments.  Guido is one of the most active members of his community bank and, for this reason, he is very well liked and respected.

He makes his living driving passengers around the Ukraine.  He's married with two children: an eleven-year-old son, and a one-year-old daughter.  He has no trouble getting business.  He has regular customers and an excellent reputation.  He's been in the business for twelve years and makes 5000 hryvni.  At present he uses his own car, a 2006 Opel Astra.  It's in great condition.\r\n\r\nVasil needs a loan of 10,000 hryvni to install a fourth generation fuel injection system so his car can run on LP gas, and also do some routine repairs. By converting his car to LP gas, he'll lower his fuel  expenses and increase profits. Vasil provides the primary means of transportation for his clients' families.  Earlier he worked for the police, but he left that and got into driving passengers, since there were no other options for supporting his family.

After moving to the US from his native Columbia, he worked for a company that builds and finishes all types of wood furniture, cabinets, floors, etc. Carlos fell in love with the job and decided to work for himself as a wood craftsman. He opened a carpentry business out of his home in Florida almost three years ago. Carlos is proud that he is able to support his family through his hard work while doing something he loves. He hopes this loan will enable him to expand by hiring employees, opening a store-front, and let him make a greater contribution to his community.\r\n\r\nThis loan from Accion USA will allow Carlos to build the credit history he needs in the United States in order to formalize his business. He then can take the necessary steps to move from his home to a store-front location. Carlos says this loan will help him to obtain the tools he needs to showcase his excellent work and access a greater number of clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6450,"image":{"id":933644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To

He was orphaned very early on, when his father died.  To take over the responsibilities for his younger brothers, he started farming, especially sugar cane.  Today, he has 10 years worth of experience in this domain and has reached a production level that proves his mastery of the business.  He now plans on growing crops in the off-season to meet market demands in his area.  Previous loans allowed him to grow his operation and to improve his crop yields through the use of herbicides.  Presently, the procurement of selected cuttings and the purchase of a motorized irrigation pump are his concerns for which he is requesting a loan of $950.  He can then increase his production.  Accomplishing these goals will offer him a degree of  financial stability that will allow his family to thrive and achieve its potential.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\nAg\u00e9 de 35 ans, Monsieur A.

on July 12, 1974 in Naimey, Niger, Mrs. Afi O. is married to a tailor who is out of work and they have five children to raise. She left school to learn to be a seamstress. After she completed her apprenticeship, she also learned to dye lengths of African print cloth. Now, lacking the necessary funds, she is doing nothing. Her business amounts to selling penny candies and such, which does not bring in any real income. The fact that her husband is also not presently working as a tailor makes it extremely hard for them to support their family. In order to get back into business and manage to support their children, Mrs. O. is requesting a loan of US$ 1000. <P>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/B>N\u00e9e le 12 juillet 1974 \u00e0 Niamey au Niger, madame Afi O. est mari\u00e9 \u00e0 un couturier sans travail avec cinq (05) enfants \u00e0 charge.

As a result, her business has taken a hit because her working capital is inadequate to purchase appreciable quantities to sell. Therefore, she is now seeking a loan to inject additional capital into her business to enable her meet the demands of the marketplace. Specifically, she wants to use the loan proceeds to increase her stock of rice and sugar and to thereby increase her profits. In turn, Gladys hopes to accumulate more savings in order to pay for her children's education fees. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the community group known as the Angel Trust Group. In this group, members guarantee each other's loans as social collateral (i.e., if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the arrears), and they provide support for one another to repay their respective loans.

Thanh Hoa City is the provincial capital of Thanh Hoa province, one of the poorest provinces in\nVietnam. It is located approximately 150 kilometers south of Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam.\nMrs. Trinh Thi Hue is the lead borrower of the group.

The other borrowers in the group will use their share of the loan as follows:\n* Mrs. Trinh Thi Hue is borrowing 1,626,900 Vietnamese Dong (~ US$93) to buy kitchenware such as pots, pans, scissors, teapots, mops,thermos flasks, rice cookers, washing up liquid and chopsticks for her market stall.\n* Mrs. Ngoc is borrowing money to buy clothes for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Lien is borrowing money to buy sugar, salt, towels, candies, biscuits, breads, etc. for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Lam Thi Hue is borrowing money to buy bowls, dishes and spoons for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Loi is borrowing money to buy blankets, pillows and sedge mats for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Lanh is borrowing money to buy bread for resale on the street in the early morning.\n\n","en":"<br><i>Note: original loan description is in English.<\/i><br>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":255520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bowls, dishes, blankets, pillows, clothes...","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Thanh Ho\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":121,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T16:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hu\u1ec7","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ng\u1ecdc","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Li\u00ean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hu\u1ec7","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"L\u1ee3i","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lanh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":9761400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20398716},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27090643},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984010},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44444663},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52955275},{"amount":95.85,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63172626}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T17:22:00Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"khang hosi","image":124954}},{"id":87862,"name":"Clarisse","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Clarisse I.  in Gatsata Sector, Gasabo District, Kigali (capital of Rwanda)!

Culipapa, Hinoba-an, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by fishing and fish vending. Her husband, Romy, is a fisherman and Josephine sells his catch in their community and in the nearby public market. They have two children who are 12 and 13 years old and are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nJosephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in July, 2006, in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their income with her fishing and fish vending business. Now she earns an average monthly income of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJosephine is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her fishing and fish vending business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is applying for her 8th loan, for 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to fund the operations of her fishing and fish vending business. Josephine is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Leipu has 2 years of experience in this business.  Leipu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leipu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Leipu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Leipu F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is a single mother of five children; three of them are already married.  The son who lives with her helps her with household expenses. \r\n\r\nHer current house is made of reeds since, after the earthquake, she wasn't able to finish the construction.

There, she started her family with Hugo, with whom she has lived for twelve years. They have two children, Jony and Yamerin, who they care for with love and dedication. Like a good country woman, she is dedicated to farming. Her main crops are coffee and bananas, which are sown in her own agricultural lands, made up of one hectare of arable land. Since she doesn't have much capital to invest in her crops, she always worked with her community bank. \"I am one of the founders\", she affirms with a lot of pride. What she likes most about her work is to be able to sell her crops to the gatherers who visit her area. She mentions, \"I don't have to transport my merchandise.\" Additionally, she receives the support of her husband who works as farm laborer in different farming lands, earning extra money for the home. Now, Yanet ventured into the production of coffee nurseries, where she earns S.400 for each thousand grown. She also works in her free time making wooden drawers to hold the fruit they produce. She belongs to the \"Luz del future\" (Future light) community bank and this is the fourth loan with MFP, where she is very happy to know that she will have financial support.

She serves her customers there, the majority of which are students, teachers and passersby. She has been doing this for 2 years and is now well-known in the area. What she likes about her work is being able to count on an income, thanks to which she helps her partner with the household expenses, as he works in the wood industry and is often away from home for periods of upto 30 days. She plans to open a restaurant in her own home. This will be her 3rd loan with MFP. She is happy to have financial support to move her business forwards, which is why she agrees to be punctual with her repayments, as with her previous loans.

The members of the group chose the name as a byproduct of the natural products they consume and sell. The other business activities of the members are:\n\nSanta \u2013grocery and food sales  \n\nAlicia, Norberto, Anayeli, y Crio - selling natural products\n\nAlejandra \u2013Cosmetics sales\n\nPrimo \u2013 construction materials sales and natural product sales\n\nMaribel \u2013 food sales and aesthetics\n\nMar\u00eda \u2013 butcher shop \n\nHugo - costume jewelry sales\n\nDo\u00f1a Santa  is 58-years old.  She is a great woman who is married to se\u00f1or Jorge.  Together they had five children, who are now grown.  Twenty years ago, the pair formed a great work team.  Together they run a food business located outside one of the churches in their area.  At the beginning, Jorge alone helped Santa transport things with only a trike or a cart.  Now, he goes around the streets of \"The Bride of the Sun\" on a  trike offering the delicious \"atole de coco (natural)\" (coconut atole- a maize-based beverage),  tamales, corn, buns and cakes; meanwhile she happily takes care of the customers in their small grocery, which they were able to open with the profit they earned. \n\nAs is now custom, every weekend Santa sets up two tables to exhibit a large variety of sweets, cakes, tacos and tamales.  They keep sodas and juices in a cooler, and in a liter container, they have horchata and hibiscus water, to spoil their customers.  \"The secret to success,\" they enthusiastically say, \"is in how we work and treat our customers.\"  Their work has allowed them to offer their family a better quality of life, primarily by giving their children an education.  \n\n\u201cFrom Monday to Friday I'm in the store.  Then, on the weekends, I have my food business.  Both jobs have allowed me to grow financially.\"  Santa adds, \"I am thankful for the opportunity of the loan.

M. lives in the 20 de Julio neighborhood [named for July 20th, Colombia's Independence Day].  It is an area that combines a commercial zone and recreation area with a residential zone full of multi-family homes.  She runs a business making and selling clothes, which she started in 1995, after learning the trade in a family workshop in 1992.  She decided to take up this activity after working as a secretary at a private business, and today she feels very satisfied with her decision because her business generates work.\r\n\r\nYolanda works an 8AM to 7PM schedule from Monday to Saturday, and therefore produces many clothes.  She stays competitive by being timely and through the prices and quality of her products.  This way, she is able to remain stable in the market, because between the stores in central Barranquilla, friends, relatives, and references, she has many clients.  She needs to buy materials for her work every three days, so she must have cash on hand to do so.  Currently, she is requesting her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will purchase fabric, thread, and adornments for the clothes she is making.\r\n\r\nYolanda dreams of owning a boutique.  On a personal level, she feels very successful because her children are professionals, even though she is separated from their father.  This is representative of how hard she worked to give them an education and a good quality of life, so that they would be prepared for the future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie

Corte, Carmen, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store business.  Her husband Roque, who is 37 years old, works as a painter to earn his living.  They have four children from 5 to 11 years old. \r\n\r\nEliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,100, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to add more stocks for her customers so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nEliza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference  in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Con 30 a\u00f1os en este negocio desea para el futuro, incrementar la cantidad de le\u00f1a que tiene y as\u00ed tener plata para pagar los estudios superiores de su hijo, a quien cuida con mucho amor y siempre se ha preocupado por que no le falte nada. Hace poco sufri\u00f3 una operaci\u00f3n del ap\u00e9ndice, por lo que est\u00e1 en cama. Pero esta dificultad no la amilana, a contrario le ida fuerzas para salir adelante. En sus tiempos libres se dedica a la agricultura, con la siembra de lechuga, espinaca y arveja; los cuales despu\u00e9s de cuidarlos y fertilizarlos constantemente los comercializa en el mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Tarma. Ella disfruta de conversar con sus clientes y siempre suelta una broma para llevarse mejor con ellos, ya que su principal estrategia en la vida es la alegr\u00eda que le pone a todo lo que hace. Por ello est\u00e1 segura que podr\u00e1 ser una de las mejores agricultoras y comerciante de la zona. Ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cVirgen Mar\u00eda\u201d y este es el noveno cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde espera de su colaboraci\u00f3n para continuar con sus objetivos. Por otro lado se compromete una vez m\u00e1s a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo. Adem\u00e1s le agrada ser parte de su banco comunal porque todos sus integrantes son personas responsables y muy solidarias. Soledad de recibir su apoyo; invertir\u00e1 el dinero solicitado en la compra de 4 bolsas de semilla de arveja que oscila entre los S\/. 375 soles cada uno y el resto comprar\u00e1 abono org\u00e1nico para esparcirlos entre sus sembr\u00edos de espinaca. \n\n","en":"Soledad, 53, lives in Palcamayo.  She is notable for being a hard working, sincere woman.  She lives in her own house with her youngest son, Alan, 24, who always helps her with her work.  Every morning, starting very early, Soledad has to divide her time among several activities.  She sells firewood, that\u2019s in quite high demand from her customers, all day.  With 30 years in this business she wants for the future to increase the amount of firewood she has in order to have money to pay for her son\u2019s higher education; she cares for him with much love and has always seen to it that he\u2019s had everything he needs.\r\n\r\nShe recently had surgery on her appendix so is bedridden.  But this difficulty doesn\u2019t discourage her; on the contrary it\u2019s given her strength to continue forward.  During her free time she farms lettuce, spinach and peas which, after caring for and fertilizing them constantly, she sells in Tarma\u2019s wholesale market.  She enjoys chatting with her customers and jokes around with them to get along with them better since her main strategy in life is to put joy into everything she does.  Because of this she\u2019s sure that she can become one of the best farmers and merchants in the zone.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cVirgen Mar\u00eda\u201d (Virgin Mary) communal bank and this is the 9th loan with MFP where she hopes to have your collaboration to continue toward her goals.  On the other hand, she commits to making her payments like she\u2019s done with previous loans.  Besides, she enjoys being part of the communal bank because all the members are responsible, mutually supportive people.  \r\n\r\nIf Soledad were to receive the support of the requested loan, she\u2019d use it to buy four sacks of pea seeds which cost around 375 soles each and would use the rest to buy organic manure to spread among her spinach crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":806510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to buy four sacks of pea seeds and sacks of organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-10T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soledad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2539.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712707}],"funded_date":"2011-07-11T01:57:07Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":318180,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam is a 26-year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband and two school-aged children.

She is married with 3 children aged between 7 and 14 years.They all go to school. She is a farmer and she has been growing maize for the past 8 years. Also her husband is a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to renovate her house and to buy a cow. \n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

She has a small farm where she farms the crop and she also a couple of cattle. Aracely lives with her husband and three children who are in school. She will invest her money in pesticides and feed for her cattle. With the extra profits she hopes she can purchase a cow and continue to provide her kids with an eduction. <\/p>\r\n<p>She is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Pesticides for rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-11T06:27:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aracely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-26T12:57:30Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:26:54Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31438},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:31:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40412},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:40:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53264},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:32:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73636},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:40:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88540},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:47:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99036}],"funded_date":"2007-05-12T12:57:30Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:47:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14142,"name":"Zarmena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zarmena lives in district 15 of Kabul, Afghanistan.

Gulom buys livestock, feeds it for 2-3 months to fatten it up and then sells the animals. The market where he sells the livestock is far from his home and so he has to rent a vehicle to transport the animals there. Gulom wants to have his own vehicle. He is asking for a loan to expand his sales so as to increase profits, to help him get closer to his goal of owning a vehicle for transporting his livestock to market.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":309126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Increase livestock sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-25T21:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084772},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000968}],"funded_date":"2009-04-26T02:18:27Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:33:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Olga Espira","image":null}},{"id":108374,"name":"Gara United Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Mohamed T. and Aminata J..

Oimniso is 45 years old and a very good entrepreneur. She is married and the loving mother of two children. Her husband has no fixed job and this is the reason why, twenty-five years ago, she decided to start her own business.\r\n\r\nOimniso started with very little merchandise but, little by little, her business grew and she also started to sell clothes with excellent results. She is very clear about the secret of success in a business. She knows it is the variety of products that she offers because if a client is looking for something that she does not have, he or she may never return to her. For this reason, she tries to always be with good stock. Oimniso is requesting a loan of $1,500 to purchase merchandise and new clothes for the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. was born on 29 November 1976 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Married to Abel Wenon, S\u00e9v\u00e9rine is the mother of three children, all of whom are in school. The family has lived in the Lokokoukoum\u00e8 district in the town of S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji for 9 years. The couple provide for the family together. S\u00e9v\u00e9rine only attended primary school. For about 5 years, S\u00e9v\u00e9rine has been selling various items (couscous, pasta, canned tomatoes and sardines, sugar, milk, rice, soap, mayonnaise, batteries, sweets, etc.) at her home. Additionally, she also sells ice cream and yogurt at her home. This activity allows her to meet her various needs. S\u00e9v\u00e9rine gets her supplies at Dantokpa, the international market in Benin, and in Lom\u00e9, Togo. S\u00e9v\u00e9rine has obtained three previous loans with ALID\u00c9 (one of Kiva's field partners). These three loans were all repaid properly. S\u00e9v\u00e9rine plans to increase the stocks of her products and better respond to the demands of her customers. It is for this reason that she is seeking a fourth loan with ALID\u00c9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

They will use the loan to stock up on more popular items like dresses, jeans, stoles, saris, and leggings. Sushilaben polishes diamonds, playing a role in the flourishing local diamond trade. She will use the loan to buy a special cutting machine, which will improve her productivity and income. Hasinaben is engaged in the local cottage industry of tie-dying, locally known as \u201cbandhani\u201d.

After she met her husband, she came to live in the neighborhood of Guachene in the Municipal District of Catembe. They had six children.\r\n<p>\r\nShe never had any training in terms of business management, and only attended the first year of elementary school.\r\n<p>\r\nBefore starting her fishing activity, she worked with the sale of seafood for two years, buying from the fishermen and reselling in Catembe and the city of Maputo. Her husband worked at the Cigarette Factory and when the company closed, he received severance pay. With the money, he bought a boat and 5 heads of cattle, and having arranged a second wife, he went to live in a neighboring area with his new wife. Joana was then living only with her youngest child.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the boat, she started to develop the fishing activity, having created two (2) jobs but it was difficult to get money together for the replacement of fishing nets and repair of the boat itself. Through some people in her area, she found out about HLUVUKU-ADSEMA and went there to request financing of 12,000.00 meticais for the purchase of fishing materials (nets and other consumables), which improved the work and production conditions  to some extent. With the credit paid off in seven months, rather than the sixteen months that were anticipated, she currently has a 5 meter boat. To expand, through this financing, she would like to increase production and create three (3) more jobs through the purchase of nets and painting the boat. She personally sells some of the fish in Catembe at a stand she acquired for that purpose, and the other part she sells to resellers. In addition to having generated jobs, her activity has a greater impact on providing seafood to improve the diet in her community (Catembe) and generates indirect jobs for the resellers who buy her fish and resell in the city of Maputo.\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nThe original business description in Portuguese is below:<\/b>\r\n<p>Localiza\u00e7\u00e3o: Bairro Guachene Catembe, Maputo, Mo\u00e7ambique\r\nCliente: Joana Luis M.\r\nSector de Actividade: Pesca\r\nValor  de Empr\u00e9stimo :16.385,00 Mtn (630.00 US$)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do montante de Empr\u00e9stimo: Compra de materiais de pesca e repara\u00e7\u00e3o de barco\r\nIn\u00edcio: 13\/11\/2006\r\nFim: 12\/11\/2007\r\n<p>\r\nJoana Luis M., de 48 anos de idade, natural do Distrito de Manhi\u00e7a, prov\u00edncia do Maputo, durante a sua inf\u00e1ncia n\u00e3o teve possebilidade de estudar depois que se juntou com seu marido, veio morar no bairro de guachene no Distrito municipal da Catembe. tiveram seis filhos. \r\nEla nunca teve nenhuma forma\u00e7\u00e3o em mat\u00e9ria de gest\u00e3o de neg\u00f3cios, estando a frequentar o primeiro ano de Alfabetiza\u00e7\u00e3o.\r\nAntes de iniciar a actividade pesqueira, dedicava-se \u00e0 venda de mariscos a dois anos, comprava nos pescadores e revendia na catembe e na cidade do Maputo.

He is a young man, who after his secondary schooling, sanctioned by the BEPC, launched himself into business alongside his mother. In very little time, he became very apt in this domain, however, he lacks funds to follow through his plans for his business. With as much good as bad and with all of the difficulties of life, he was able to set up a small business selling traditional style skirts(pagnes) in a small market in Lome. This activity is exposed to the elements, which makes it victim to sun and rain. To resolve his problems with his space in the market, he requests a loan of $1,000 to rent a storefront and to expand the stock of his merchandise. At this time of year, the sales of traditional style skirts is very high. \r\n<p>Translated from French by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur Fran\u00e7ois Djiwonou K. est n\u00e9 \u00e0 Vogan au sud du Togo le 07 janvier 1976.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":255671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 50 bags of rice in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T02:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica J\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436367},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130639},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027436},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613437},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010517},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232813}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T02:29:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":87910,"name":"Bernardina Delia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bernardina es socia del Banco Comunal Amor Divino.\nBernardina es casada, tiene 56 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Bernardina tiene una panader\u00eda en su casa en donde elabora todo tipos de panes, para lo cual cuenta con la ayuda de personal, sus ventas los realiza en su mismo horno.

Having lacked the chance to go to school, and after having done several kinds of work unsuccessfully, he got introduced over 25 years ago to commercial business, notably buying and selling electronic equipment (radios, cassettes, solar panels, satellite dishes, batteries, etc.)  He enjoys a fine reputation in this domain and receives many orders.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn his search for added financial resources, he applied to collaborate with the institution (Soro Yiriwaso micro-financing) and is now on his second individual loan, which will enable him to buy 15 radios of various brands, 2 solar panels, 5 shielded batteries, 5 satellite dishes, and 200 cassettes.  Supplies are gotten in Bamako to be sold in Sikasso in his shop located at the bus station next to the K\u00e8n\u00e8dougou Voyage company.  Along with his shop, he also sells mobile phones by special order.  For customers, he has travelers, bus drivers, etc.  Certain customers pay cash and others, on credit.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, he envisions realizing a monthly profit of 400,000 francs CFA.  With these profits in hand, he intends to cover most of his expenses and those of his family, to make the interest payments, and to invest the rest in his main business.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":290109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy radios, solar panels, satellite dishes, batteries, and K7 cassettes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salif ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":62912.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033734},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":62912.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621101},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":62912.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020067},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":62912.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242812},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":62912.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678425},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:01Z","rounded_local_amount":62912.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112460},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":62912.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028105},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":62912.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873483}],"funded_date":"2009-04-11T19:50:45Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":100198,"name":"Rosenda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosenda  inici\u00f3 el negocio porqu\u00e9 siempre le gustaron las ventas y adem\u00e1s pod\u00eda tener un ingreso extra que le permitiera ayudar con los gastos de la casa y tambi\u00e9n ayudar a sus hijas.

She began the business in March of 1989. She had a type of small store where she sold basic necessities. Then she started a tortilla shop because she realized that there wasn\u2019t one in the neighborhood, and she and her neighbors had to go a long way to buy them. For a while, both businesses worked well, but then she began to have problems finding trustworthy employees, so she decided close them. A year and a half ago, she began selling house wares and with this business she has been able to establish her work schedule and she doesn\u2019t have to have a fixed schedule. \r\n\r\nWhen she began this business, she had very few customers, but she began to offer her products to friends, neighbors, and previous customers. They found out she was selling these products and they began to buy.

housewife of Leomar D.. They live in a village of Brgy. Buliwao, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya with their four children. Being parents, they want their children to finish their studies so that they will be employed someday. Despite our economic crisis, they still have the strong determination to uplift their status of living.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farming is the common source of their income.

She owns a business venture, selling puletasi (Samoan formal wear).  Tatupu has many years of experience in this business.  Tatupu needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tatupu joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tatupu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tatupu M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She lives in Bais City, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari-sari (general) store and fishing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Felina is borrowing PHP 12,000 to purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Felina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

city of Mongolia.  She lives in a small house in the suburbia with her husband and two kids. Her husband works at furniture manufacturing company and daughter goes to a kindergarten while her son attends local public school. \r\n\r\nShe started running a clothing retail stall at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia, in 2006 with 200,000 Mongolian Tugriks (MNT) in her working capital. At the beginning stages of her business, she rented a stall at Narantuul from another person who had a rental contract with Narantuul. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time. At this time her stall had 1 million MNT in working capital. Usually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract with Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand.\r\nHowever, in 2007, Ms. Odgerel had the opportunity to sign a rental contract directly with Narantuul in order to make her business more stable. As a result of her hard work, today she has 2,500,000 MNT in her working capital. Besides that, with the profit of her business, she managed to build new small house for living and bought two yards to extend. Moreover, she has just bought a car, which is used for couple years, which has become essential need for her family. \r\n\r\nAltantuya is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT. With this loan, she wants to import more clothes for spring from Beijing, China. Her long term objective is to buy an apartment where her family can have a better living condition. Altantuya and her husband are trying their best to achieve their goals.

She rents a frozen food store, and this business allows her to cover the store rent costs and to provide for all of the needs of the family. She set up her store in a well-travelled road, which is why she sees good business.  She even receives orders for certain holidays in the district. Many people look to her because her meat are of good quality. She is currently in need to restock her supply, which is the reason why she is requesting a loan from Wages (Kiva Field Partner). She will purchase 25 boxes of chicken meat and 25 boxes of turkey meat. She is determined to pay off the loan on time.<\/p>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Erika Lindig, Kiva

They all help one another so that they can succeed together.\r\n<p>\r\nEach day Marcela wakes up early to get her children ready for school.  Afterwards she begins preparing the food that she will sell for the day.  Starting at 4pm and with the help of her children, she begins setting up the space outside of her home where she sells her dishes until midnight.  What she enjoys cooking the most are stuffed potatoes, tortillas, and fried chicken since they sell very well among her neighbors and customers.  They prefer the taste of her food, the good prices, and the extra serving of rice that she offers.  Her business is very profitable because the income enables her to support her children and provide them an education.  What she dislikes is waiting until the late night hours before all of her food is sold.  Therefore, she has plans to improve and expand the facilities at her kiosk so that she can sell more comfortably.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  Marcela is very grateful to everyone who made it possible for her to access a loan so that she could continue working.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 31 years old. Froilan is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Froilan owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Froilan has been engaged in his business for over 14 years. He also raises chickens and hopes to acquire piglets that he could also raise.\r\n\r\nFroilan joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Froilan has successfully repaid a previous loan  from CEVI. Froilan is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure and also feed for the chickens. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Froilan from CEVI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.
