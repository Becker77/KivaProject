Colette Titiola lives alone with her children and provides for them by herself. She has had a little bit of schooling.

Asad has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but with no success, his requests consistently rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nThe only source of family income is agricultural activities, including their two cows whose milk is used in cheese production. Asad owns 0.7 hectare of land upon which he grows alfalfa. He also has a greenhouse and sows tomatoes and cucumbers. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nAsad's loan request from Credo was approved within the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the loan, Asad will build a new greenhouse which will enable him to grow more vegetables and thus increase the income of the family. This new business initiative will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":1241908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to build a greenhouse and sow tomatoes and cucumbers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kirikhlo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":131,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asad ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968415},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748837},{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612753},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856500},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133194},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420106826},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254434},{"amount":1950,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449669883}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T03:06:30Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:05:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":499766,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is 34, a farmer in Nkubu county in Kenya where she lives with her husband and two children who are both schooling.

She has worked in agriculture and fishing for several years. She is a humble, dedicated, and enterprising woman who wants a better future for herself and her family. To her, this is the most important thing and it is what drives her to search for better alternatives. She lives in a rural area of the country and her home does not have electric lighting. These days, this is a basic necessity for the home, and Blanca knows that lighting is fundamental for her family to have a better quality of life. Therefore, she decided to request a loan from Integral. This loan will allow her to buy an environmentally-friendly lamp. This gives her an effective solution to her problem since it is low in cost, and it also uses renewable energy resources. This is just what she needs in order to have lighting at night in her home. Blanca Esther is very happy and enthusiastic for the help, and assures that she will pay off her debt.

For the past 3 years, Yisinta has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells flour, sugar, soap, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Yisinta has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more commodities like sodas, sugar, splash juice and cooking oil for resale, and will help Yisinta to generate greater profits and pay for her medical bills. Yisinta hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house and also make sure that she works hard to see that she educates her child. \r\n\r\nYisinta is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For several years he has earned his living by farming and fishing.  He's a modest, determined, and persistent man.  He wants a better future for himself and his small family, which is most important to him and impels him to seek better opportunities in life.  He lives in a very modest area of the country and his house doesn't have electricity.  In these times that's a basic home necessity and Le\u00f3nides is sure that it's indispensable if his family is to have a better quality of life.  That's why he decided to seek a loan from Integral.  The loan will allow him to buy a low-cost energy-saving lamp that will provide an effective solution for the home environment because it is priced accessibly and, because it uses renewable energy, it's exactly what he needs to light his house at night.  He is really excited and appreciates the support.  He assures us that he'll pay it off and at the same time he hopes God will grant his family the full life they

is 30 years old. He lives in the small village of Lagodekhi District in East Georgia. Besarion has a large family: a wife, two infant children, parents and a grandmother who is provided with a retirement pension. He requested a loan from the local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides that, Besarion has a 0.5 hectare vineyard and 27 persimmon trees. They produce wine and sell the cheese locally in an open market.  It is hardly enough food for such a large family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBesarion requested a loan from Credo to start-up his family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of thei low income. With the received credit, Besarion will purchase a car. As their existing income isn\u2019t enough for the family, and their living conditions are poor, Besarion decided to work as a taxi driver after buying the car. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

For the past 2 years, Margret has been working hard to manage her small clothing business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Margret has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Margret to generate greater profits and pay for her medical bills and her child. Margret hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nMargret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

That way she'll generate more income to provide for the financial well-being of her family.\r\n\r\nMaria lives with her husband, a twenty-four-year-old son who goes to the university, and a thirteen-year-old daughter who's in school.  Maria's professional dreams include being able to buy the shop so she can expand her business.  She is very glad and appreciative of the opportunity given to her by Fondo Esperanza because it will allow her to invest in her business.

With the loan she will buy hair stripper, oxidant, dye and coffee.\r\n\r\nOne of Maria\u2019s goals is to continue hairdressing and selling coffee to her clientele, and therefore generate a higher income to give her family good economic well-being and aim for a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nMaria lives with her husband and two children aged 23 and 17 who are studying. Many of her dreams are at a personal, family, and work level, but what she wishes for most is to give a good education to her children so that they have a stable profession.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and appreciative of the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has provided her since it has permitted her to invest in her business.\r\nFurthermore, she feels very comfortable in the company of the rest of the entrepreneurs of the group of the communal bank, since they share different activities and interests, which also have served her as moments of distraction. With respect to the training imparted in the meetings, she has learned the best way to manage her business.\r\n\r\nPadre Las Casas is a municipality in the south of Chile, neighboring the city of Temuco in the Araucan\u00eda region.

Zulafa hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house for herself. \r\n\r\nZulafa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is a widow and a mother to her children. She operates her business, while at the same time she manages her household, together with her children. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNelia owns and operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round, palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. Because rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that a person can buy, sometimes even from a peddler while riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Nelia is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy larger quantities of raw materials, like fabric and thread, to use in making rugs. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNelia hopes to increase production, and dreams of being able to do her family good through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

With the received credit Irma will purchase a milk cow and feeds for the cattle. She also plans to expand her shed and her dairy business.

Es divorciada y ha tenido que salir adelante con sus 4 hijos a quienes educa para un d\u00eda verlos convertidos en profesionales. Vive en el cant\u00f3n Pastaza ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta ciudad. La competencia entre microempresarios es muy grande, sin embargo cada uno ha puesto su valor agregado para ganar preferencia con los clientes. \nMar\u00eda Isabel ha buscado las formas de dar a sus hijos una buena educaci\u00f3n y adem\u00e1s la calidad de vida que ellos se merecen, es por eso que hace 10 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con un restaurant peque\u00f1o en donde ofrece comida r\u00e1pida y tradicional. Son 10 horas las que invierte en esta actividad, esperando obtener recompensa rentable. Su padre le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a llevar a cabo este negocio y est\u00e1 muy agradecida con \u00e9l, pues gracias al esp\u00edritu emprendedor que hered\u00f3 de su padre, Mar\u00eda cada a\u00f1o mejora su negocio y aun cuando se qued\u00f3 sin nada por un rob\u00f3 que sufri\u00f3 en el local, no se ha dado por vencida, inclusive ha buscado otras alternativas de generar ingresos como es la venta de ropa por cat\u00e1logo. En muchas ocasiones sus clientes compran los platos que prepara Mar\u00eda pero tienen que servirse sin la comodidad de una mesa o una silla, ya que las pocas mesas con las que cuenta en el local siempre est\u00e1n ocupadas. Es por eso que Mar\u00eda ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de mobiliario para adecuar su restaurant con las comodidades que demandan sus clientes. Ella encontr\u00f3 en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa la mejor opci\u00f3n para solicitar este cr\u00e9dito, ya que en esta instituci\u00f3n se preocupan porque las personas superen la pobreza y adem\u00e1s le brindan asesor\u00eda y facilidad para la obtenci\u00f3n de cr\u00e9dito. Mar\u00eda Isabel espera que con esta inversi\u00f3n sus ventas se multipliquen y su negocio genere m\u00e1s utilidades que le permitan reinvertir y tambi\u00e9n mejorar su estilo de vida y el de sus hijos. ","en":"Mar\u00eda Isabel is a thirty-eight-year-old woman, who, when she was young, did not succeed in continuing on to university studies and completed her studies after high school.  She's divorced and has had to get ahead with four children who she's sending to school so that one day they'll become professionals.  She lives in the Pastaza canton, located in the province of the same name, in the Amazon region of the Republic of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the canton is the city of Puyo, located in the middle of the of the Amazon jungle in the western portion of Pastaza Province and is at 924m above sea level.   The population is small, but there is a wide variety of areas preferred by domestic and international tourists, primarily for ecological activities and extreme sports.  It's a city that is growing by the day economically due to commerce, livestock, agriculture, and tourism, and so financial and commercial companies have established branches to take advantage of the economic activity the city supports.  Competition among small-business people is very stiff, yet they all offer up their added value in order to win clients' favor.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel has sought out ways to give her children a good education and the quality of life they deserve, so she has invested ten years running a small restaurant where she offers fast food and traditional food, waiting to earn a profitable reward.  Her father taught her how to run this kind of business and she's very grateful to him, because, thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit she inherited from him, she improves the business every year.  Even when the business was robbed and left her with nothing, she was not defeated, and has even looked for other alternative to make money, like catalog clothing sales.\r\n\r\nSo often, Mar\u00edas clients order the dishes she prepares, but have to be served without the comfort of tables and chairs because the few tables the restaurant has are always filled.  That's why Mar\u00eda is seeking loan, so she can buy furniture to outfit her restaurant with the comfort clients demand.  She found Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to be the best option for getting a loan, because the institution concerns itself with helping people overcome poverty by provides lending advice and facilitating loans.  Mar\u00eda Isabel hopes that, with the investment, her sales will multiply and her business will generate more profits that she can reinvest to improve her and her children's lifestyle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1242315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural

He is a single dad to two children who he loves and who are his driving force in life. Urbano is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who puts all his effort into getting his family ahead in life. Unfortunately Urbano was unable to finish primary school as he had to work from very early on to support his parents given that his family had a very low income, although he very much would have liked to have pursued a professional career in Accountancy. In his free time, Urbano likes watching television and on some occasions cooks a delicious dish of rice with duck to spoil his children as it is their favorite food.\r\n\r\nAt his own initiative, and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Urbano works providing his freighting services, and has a small motorcycle with an attached trailer which he uses to work. Urbano works every day from the early hours in the morning and he can do this for approximately 12 hours. He feels comfortable performing his job and thinks that it is going well because of the friendly treatment that he offers to his customers.\r\n\r\nUrbano is very grateful to the Kiva loan lenders as it is thanks to the help given that he will be able to repair and overhaul his motorcycle. In this manner he will be able to rely on his work tool that is in good conditions to continue offering his services. That is how Urbano will continue working and forging ahead to make his biggest dream come true, that of seeing his children become good professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1242362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Vulnerable

She has dedicated herself to selling fast food for the past five years. She performs her work Monday to Sunday from 11 AM to 12 AM at night. She has a lot of clients to whom she offers barbecued meat, full meals, french friends, ice cream, and drinks. Sometimes she works with the help of her daughter. She adapted a space in her house to sell the fast food.\r\n\r\nThe merchandise and ingredients she needs are used at various butcher shops, supermarkets, and at fairs where she finds potatoes at a low cost, which is economically convenient. With this loan she will buy potatoes and flour.\r\n\r\nOne of Norma's goals is to have the possibility of obtaining a larger location with more space to put her machines and better attend to her clients.\r\n\r\nNorma lives together with her four daughters and six granddaughters. Her dreams in regard to her work are to have a bigger business and to sell other supplies. At a familial level, she wants to provide the best for her six granddaughters and her daughters so that they have a good experience in life and a good education for their future granddaughters.\r\n\r\nShe is so content and grateful for the opportunities which Fondo Esperanza has provided her that she has allowed them to invest in her company. Furthermore, she is grateful for her personal development there because she has learned to organized and distribute her income and investments better.\r\n\r\nPadre Las Cases is a county in the south of Chile, near the city of Temuco, in the Araucan\u00eda region.

She lives in Borjomi District with her mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Irina requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because of low income and her family's poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is Irina's monthly income. She works as a shop assistant. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo's estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor income category. \r\n\r\nIrina requested a loan from Credo to restart a family business, which had recently been stopped because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision for business start-ups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Irina will purchase the shop where she works as an assistant. The current owner decided to sell the shop and move to a new residence. After Irina officially registers the shop, she will continue working there. Owning the shop will increase the income of Irina's family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of Irina's family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1242141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a shop.

desde temprana edad, en la situaci\u00f3n dif\u00edcil que se hallaban, por lo que solo termin\u00f3 sus estudios de la escuela primaria, por lo cual muchos de sus sue\u00f1os se vieron frustrados como por ejemplo el de ser un futbolista profesional. Sin embargo Luis estima que la recompensa de ver a su familia con una vida estable ha compensado el vac\u00edo de esos sue\u00f1os no cumplidos. Luis vive con su madre Cruz de 59 a\u00f1os quien se dedica a quehaceres dom\u00e9sticos en su hogar y tambi\u00e9n con su hermana Susana que es costurera y tiene dos hijos; Dayana y Jhon que se encuentran estudiando. Juntos viven en Quito en el sur de la ciudad.  Hasta hace pocos el sector sur de la ciudad de Quito, no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles. Chillogallo, en donde reside Luis, es un sector con una alta actividad comercial que es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y que aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios.\nLuis hace 2 a\u00f1os  con la experiencia y consejo de su t\u00eda, decidi\u00f3 establecer un negocio de comercio de frutas, verduras y legumbres a brigadas militares quienes compran al por mayor para abastecer en los cuarteles de formaci\u00f3n militar de la ciudad. Dedica 7 horas a esta actividad y recibe ayuda de su prima que tambi\u00e9n tiene experiencia en esta actividad. Ahora Luis desea comprar m\u00e1s surtido de sus productos para satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes y as\u00ed hacer que sus ventas se incrementen y poder retomar sus estudios y con la experiencia que tiene un d\u00eda llegar a constituir una empresa y adem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n tener la oportunidad de un d\u00eda demostrar su capacidad como jugador de f\u00fatbol. Para este fin, Luis ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para comprar nuevos productos. El considera que es una nueva oportunidad para salir adelante y adem\u00e1s piensa aprovechar al m\u00e1ximo este cr\u00e9dito y la asesor\u00eda que le brindan all\u00ed como herramientas para una buena administraci\u00f3n de su negocio. ","en":"Luis, 21, is single and pledged to help his family from a very young age because of the difficult situation in which they found themselves.  This is why he only finished elementary school.  As a result, many of his dreams were frustrated, such as being a professional soccer player.  Nevertheless, Luis values that seeing his family with a stable life has repaid the emptiness of his unrealized dreams.\r\n\r\nLuis lives with his mother, Cruz, 59, who devotes herself to the household, and with his sister Susana, who's a seamstress and has two children, Dayana and Jhon, who are students.  Together they live in Quito in the southern part of the city.  Until a few years ago the southern sector of the city of Quito was not considered one of the stronger economic sectors of the capital of the Republic of Ecuador.  Now this area is considered a force in the city's economy.  Here there are enterprising families who have struggled to get ahead.\r\n\r\nBetween the natives and migrants from other cities and countries, it has been a point of encounter of residents of several provinces and is built with wide streets.  Cillogallo, where Luis lives, is an area of high commercial activity that is strengthened more all the time and contributes to the city's economic growth.  This area stands out for its parks with expansive green areas where families go on the weekend.  There's access to all types of services, and the residents are enterprising people who make the most of every opportunity to set up new businesses.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, with his experience and the advice of his aunt, Luis decided to set up a business selling fruits, vegetables, and legumes to military troops who buy in bulk to stock the military barracks in the city.  He devotes seven hours to this job and has the help of his cousin, who also has experience in this work.\r\n\r\nNow Luis wants to buy more assorted products to satisfy customer demand and increase his sales, so he can take up his studies again.  With his experience, he hopes to one day set up a company and also to have the opportunity to demonstrate his abilities as a soccer player.\r\n\r\nTo this end Luis has requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to buy new products.  He sees it as a new opportunity to get ahead.  He also plans to make the most of this loan and the advice they give him as tools for managing his business well.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1242366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy assorted fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T23:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T23:30:04Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1542.3,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":240.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":252.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":256.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":261.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":263.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":267.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":242.17,"local_amount":240.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":242.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126213},{"amount":253.77,"local_amount":252.51,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":253.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516818},{"amount":257.49,"local_amount":256.21,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":257.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068674},{"amount":262.39,"local_amount":261.08,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":262.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494940},{"amount":265.09,"local_amount":263.78,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":265.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524869},{"amount":269.09,"local_amount":267.75,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":269.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133174}],"funded_date":"2012-12-22T05:07:36Z","paid_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":499998,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis is a 39-year-old businessman.

Lucy is 22 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, with two of them currently in school. For the past three years, Lucy has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Lucy has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more cartons of clothes for resale, and will help Lucy to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Lucy hopes that in the future she will be able to build a big commercial house of her own. \r\n\r\nLucy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

His household consists of his wife and three children aged between 3 and 7 years.  His business arose from family tradition since he\u2019s watched this activity since he was nine-years-old helping his family sell fruit.  This is why when he completed high-school he went into it with his father\u2019s support who lent him his initial capital to start earning income.  He sells bananas, mandarins, grapefruit, apples, pears and in general seasonal fruit.  He sells on credit and for cash from Monday through Saturday from 9 in the morning until 6 in the afternoon because he has regular customers.  They are employees in nearby firms and store owners since his sales point is located in a commercial corridor where there are many merchants.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s currently applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo by means of which he will buy in large volumes mainly grapes because the end of the year is approaching and tradition holds that they generate family prosperity for the following year so they must not be absent from the New Year\u2019s Eve table.  This is why he\u2019s earmarking his Kiva loan for this purpose thus insuring success, especially by paying cash and buying larger amounts than usual since his sales are guaranteed because his customers are waiting for their orders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1242489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy grapes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-11-23T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-23T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabian Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66582},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68136},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":69726},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71353},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73018},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74721},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76464}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.95,"local_amount":66582,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":72576.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130872},{"amount":40.88,"local_amount":68136,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":74270.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519743},{"amount":41.84,"local_amount":69726,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":76003.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071582},{"amount":42.81,"local_amount":71353,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":77777.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497798},{"amount":43.81,"local_amount":73018,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":79592.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527606},{"amount":44.83,"local_amount":74721,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81448.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928364},{"amount":45.88,"local_amount":76464,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83348.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705518}],"funded_date":"2012-11-24T10:57:12Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":500035,"name":"Harriet's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harriet is 20 years old and is single with one child.

She lives in the municipality of Soledad with her spouse and has three children whose ages range between 28 and 31.  Isabel started her business four years ago taking advantage of the fact that her neighbor was in the same kind of business and moved away leaving his customer base's needs unmet. She took advantage of this juncture and decided to go into this activity and has done very well with it and has managed to grow.  Her main customers are stores in her neighborhood and in other sectors as well as housewives and neighbors who are aware of the quality way she works with products derived from delicious, natural corn.

They have three children who are 15, 8, and 2 years old. Her family is what motivates her to better herself every day. She has her own house, but at the moment she is living temporarily with her mother-in-law. She works hard to obtain a better quality of life for all her family.\r\n\r\nJessi works selling regional products including bananas, cassavas, coconas, bijao leaves, and limes. How much she sells of each product depends on what is in season, as some of the products are more difficult to get in certain months and, on the other hand, sometimes she has an abundance of a particular product. She has a stall in one of the main markets in the city, and because so many people pass by, she sells a lot during the day. She has been doing this work for four years, and she has always done it on her own.\r\n\r\nShe really likes her work because she feels free and independent, and she also makes good money which makes her feel at ease. Her main goal is to expand her business and start to sell her products at wholesale by sending them to other cities. She is sure that this will increase her income considerably. This is her third loan with MFP and she is very happy with the financial support she is receiving because it makes her confident that her business is going to grow. She pledges to continue making her repayments on time and as agreed. She is delighted to be a member of her communal bank because everyone is responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 1500 soles, she will buy a larger quantity of bananas and cassavas, because there is a high demand for these products at this time of year.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1242490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy bananas and cassavas to sell at the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-23T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-23T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":217.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":241.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":247.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":250.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":267.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":275.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.98,"local_amount":217.45,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":225.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053885},{"amount":96.62,"local_amount":241.56,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":251.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188915},{"amount":98.97,"local_amount":247.42,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":257.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572812},{"amount":100.21,"local_amount":250.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":260.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122475},{"amount":106.96,"local_amount":267.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":277.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868296},{"amount":110.26,"local_amount":275.65,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":286.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577115}],"funded_date":"2012-11-29T05:07:58Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geraldine Pugh","image":null}},{"id":500219,"name":"Lais","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lais, de 21 a\u00f1os, es una joven emprendedora, buena, amable y muy responsable, aun es soltera pero tiene un hijo de tan solo 7 meses de nacido, vive en casa de su madre, ella es un apoyo muy importante en su familia ya que siempre est\u00e1 en constante aporte a la solvencia de su hogar y esto permite que tengan mejores ingresos econ\u00f3micos para mejorar su calidad de vida.\nNuestra amiga Lais se dedica a la venta de mercader\u00eda variada.

His name is Mulloabdullo, he is 20 years old, single, and lives with his parents. The economic situation of his family is very tough so 2 years ago, he went to Russia as a migrant worker. When he had earned a little money, he returned home and used his savings to pay for his family's necessities. Mulloabdullo had a difficult time as a migrant worker because he does not have a post-secondary education. This is why he entered the University of Mining and Metallurgy this year, where he is currently a successful first-year student. He now has to pay his tuition, and is seeking a loan for this purpose. Mulloabdullo is waiting for your kind assistance. Let's work together to help him become a skilled future

At the moment she does not have a romantic relationship but she has two children who are 9 and 11 years old, whom she has raised with much love and gives them all the attention they need.  She lives in her parents' home and together they work hard daily to get ahead in life.  The work that Rocio does is selling cosmetics; among the products she sells are face powders, lipstick, perfume, cologne, shampoo, talcum powder, and other items for skin and body care.  She has done this job for more than five years and sells mainly to her friends and family members through a system of credit delivery, later making the collection.  She says she works alone because this way her earnings increase.  On the other hand, in the mornings she works as a secretary in a public institution which allows her to also offer her products to her work friends.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is that it allows her to have time with her family, and it is going well because her earnings exceed her initial investment.  Later on she hopes to establish her own store where she offers her products with more comfort in addition to other accessories and feminine garments.  This is her fourth loan with MFP; she thanks those people who have offered her the loan that she needs to increase her working capital and she promises to make her repayments on time.  She is happy to belong to her communal bank because they are mutually supportive and responsible.  With the requested amount of 3000 soles she will buy a large quantity of personal care products like perfumes, colognes, shampoo, talcum powder, and others, in addition to investing in the purchase of shoes, wallets, and other accessories for women with which she hopes to increase her earnings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1242514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfume, cologne, shampoo, talcum powder, shoes and wallets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-23T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-23T01:50:04Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":434.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":482.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":494.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":500.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":534.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":552.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":359.42,"local_amount":917.67,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":933.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188917},{"amount":193.73,"local_amount":494.64,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":503.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572814},{"amount":196.16,"local_amount":500.83,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":509.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122477},{"amount":209.38,"local_amount":534.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":543.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868298},{"amount":216.31,"local_amount":552.27,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":561.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577117}],"funded_date":"2012-12-20T07:19:05Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":500046,"name":"Blerta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Blerta is twenty-six years old and married.

For the past three years, Florence has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells flour, sugar, soap, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more commodities such as sodas, sugar, splash juice, and cooking oil for resale and will help Florence to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child and other basic needs for the family. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to to see her children graduate. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

He lives in the small village of Bolnisi with his wife. He is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has 2 calves and a 0.3 hectare plot of land where he grows potatoes, cucumbers and peppers. The harvested products are sold locally at a good price.

She is kind and hardworking. She has been single for many years, but she has 4 children who she raised alone and with much strength. She lives in her own house with her youngest daughter of 15 years, since the others are independents. However, they always offer the necessary support to afford the household expenses. The primary occupation of our friend Rosa consists in the sale of groceries such as rice, sugar, milk, eggs, oils, and some regional products such as plantains and vegetables. She has a small shop which she has established in her house, and from there is open every day from early on. All that she offers to the public she renews daily, purchasing wholesale in the city marketplace. She selects the freshest and healthiest vegetables.  She works alone the majority of the time, but occasionally her daughter helps her when she has to do some errands outside of home. She has done this work for about a year and she likes the convenience and ease with which she is able to generate income in her own home.\r\n\r\nShe really likes what she does because the dividends that she obtains from the sale of her products, she is able to afford the academic expenses of her daughter and can also cover the basic necessities of her household. Later, she hopes to expand her small shop so that she is able to offer more items and her earnings will grow. This is her 4th loan with MFP. She is very grateful for the loan opportunity that they offer to her, and for the financial backing that she needs to get ahead. She promises to pay her monthly payments punctually, and to continue working with great responsibility together with the members of her communal bank. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 2000 soles, she will purchase more staple products, such as rice, sugar, eggs, milk, noodles, vegetables, and others. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1242518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, sugar, eggs, milk, noodles, vegetables, and others.

Shamila's work consists of food sales. The main dish that she offers her customers is \"chicken soup\" She has a stand in a busy street in the city that is adjacent to the fishing port and other public entities,  which permits her to have a great number of customers that go in search of the delicious and hearty soups, as only she knows how to prepare. She has done this work more than 2 years and it is going very well. Moreover, she has a mototaxi which she bought with the help of her spouse, and that generates an additional economic income. She really likes what she does since it allows her to have time available in the evenings and to be quiet in her house with her children. Additionally she feels that it is going very well since she generates economic income doubly for her household. She hopes later to have a business in her house related to the technical vehicular sector so that she can work together with her spouse. \r\n\r\nThis is her 4th loan with MFP. It is for this that she is grateful to all the people who have made her loans possible to continue doing her work with the greatest results.

Sierra Leone, is very pleased to present to you members of the \u201cGo Befo\u201d group. These are small-scale entrepreneurs, who have come to SMT\/Kiva lenders to seek a loan of 800,000 Leones (for each person) in order to invest in their businesses. This is the third loan that this group of entrepreneurs are accessing from Kiva lenders through SMT. With the help of the previous Kiva lenders' loan, they were able to increase their business inventories, make better profits and improve their living conditions. Having completed repayment of their last loan successfully, two members out of the five in the group would like to get a new loan, in order to further improve their businesses.  \r\n\r\nKadiatu is the featured leader of this group. Kadiatu is 40 years old. She is married and has five children, who are attending secondary schools. Kadiatu sells cooked rice with delicious sauce, and has been a businesswoman for 10 years now.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Rhodora is requesting a Php12,000 loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. <p>\r\n\r\nRhodora hopes to further expand, and dreams of giving her children a good quality education through all of her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<p>\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLoreta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Loreta's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Loreta is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLoreta hopes to expand her business and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and  she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1242553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

His two sons and the family of one of them are also living on his plot of land. His older son is single and runs a taxi business. His younger son has a family which consists of five members: his wife and three children. His younger son is a driver for a tour company and his wife doesn\u2019t have a job. \r\n\r\nBalganjav started to build a house for his younger son\u2019s family and the house is 20% complete. As every father loves his children, Balganjav is planning to build the house walls with materials such as cement, brick and glass-wool. This is to stop heat loss through the walls which, along with the house's interior decoration, will be built using energy-saving materials. A low-pressure furnace will be installed and this will emit less harmful chemicals into the atmosphere thus helping to save the environment. So that his grandchildren will live in comfortable conditions, Balganjav is requesting a 5,000,000 MNT loan to complete the new house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":1242588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"to complete the new house.

She is married to Ersus, a worker, and she is a mother to her children. She manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLutchie operates a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products from the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, etc. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with one-month's credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue and thus they earn the profits that they depend on as their income. Lutchie's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Lutchie is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, undergarments, etc. needed for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLutchie hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of her family having a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1242590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To buy supplies and merchandise products needed for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-23T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-23T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lutchie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1643.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960439},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095176},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3286.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484325},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3286.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036837}],"funded_date":"2012-11-23T16:20:45Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":500274,"name":"Babi Rahayu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As Ni Ketut has a local sow, she will use her new loan to purchase pig feed and renovate the barn.
