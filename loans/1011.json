Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity.  Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills.  Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing.  In Patan, the Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or carved in stone.  With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.  This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing their profit

Mr. Patricio is 53 years old, lives with his wife and three daughters.  \r\n\r\nHe works providing public taxi services on his motorcycle, a popular means of transportation in this country.

Ella en un espacio de su vivienda, ubic\u00f3 una tienda, en la que vende en peque\u00f1as proporciones,  los bienes de consumo diario, a  las familias de la comunidad, de acuerdo a sus capacidades de compra. Su iniciativa de negocio naci\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 1999, aunque tenia experiencia en tiendas desde el 1972, por eso ella comenz\u00f3 poco a poco, pero con paso firme; primero compr\u00f3 un enfriador, luego agreg\u00f3 arroz, aceite, az\u00facar y finalmente carnes, l\u00e1cteos y refrescos. Hoy en su negocio le va bien, vende diariamente desde las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 9 de la noche y unas veces de contado y otras a cr\u00e9dito, pues tiene una cartera de clientes que ya conoce y les financia sus compras diarias, para que le paguen semanalmente.

","en":"Carmen Elena, who is 62 years old, lives in the town of Soledad with her husband. They have two daughters, ages 43 and 29. She located a store in a space in her home. There she sells products for daily use, in small quantities, to the families of her community, in accordance with her capacity to make purchases. Her business initiative began in the year 1999, even though she had experience in stores since 1972. For this reason she began little by little, but with firm steps. First she bought a refrigerator, then she added rice, oil, sugar, and finally meat, dairy products, and soft drinks. Now her business is going well for her. Every day she sells from 5 in the morning until 9 at night, sometimes for cash and sometimes on credit, since she has a customer base whom she knows, and she finances their daily purchases, because they pay her weekly. Her customers are from the neighborhood where she lives and its surroundings, since they know that in her store they will find everything they need. Recently her customers have increased, and her working capital has become insufficient to meet their demand, because the turnover is very rapid and she constantly needs to be placing orders, which gets her behind in her sales tasks. This is why she is turning to a Kiva loan, with which she will buy milk products and sausages, in addition to a display case to improve the appearance of her business premises. With a Kiva loan, she will make this investment and will succeed in improving her stock and increasing her daily sales, because they grow during the Christmas and New Year's seasons, making the investment of a loan very effective."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1243039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

","en":"Indira is 33 years old, married, and has three children. According to the mother, the elder son is studying in the fifth class. He is very serious and clever. Her daughter and second son will soon go to school, but they are not like their brother and they love to play around and make noise. \r\n\r\nAs income for the family, Indira engages in the food trade. Thanks to her hard work, Indira's activities can bring in about 20,000 som per month, which covers the basic costs of food and household needs for the family. Given the special friendliness of the shop owner and a good assortment of products, Indira has many customers visiting her store, which requires the participation of her whole family in the business. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the store, Indira also has a public bath which in turn generates an additional 10,000 KGS per month. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Indira appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 90,000 som (KGS) to increase her inventory at the store and the expansion of the bath. Indira will use income from the loan to invest in a further increase in her business and in the long term to build a big house for her family and a barn for livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1242637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

","en":"Gregoria, 48, lives in the south of the city with her partner and her 20-year-old daughter. She hopes to see her daughter become a successful professional and this is what pushed her forward in her day to day life. Gregoria earns money for her household through a business in which she prepares and sells natural juices, soft drinks, candy, and fried foods. She also sells a variety of merchandise, like personal hygiene products, soaps, creams, disposable products, towels, tablecloths, etc. She sells for cash, working every day of the week. Her customers are mainly shopkeepers and residents of the neighborhood where she lives. Increasing her sales in the upcoming holiday season at the end of the year is proving to be a challenge. She doesn't have enough working capital to increase her inventory and earn more income, taking advantage of the season.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is resorting to a Kiva loan, with which she will buy personal hygiene products, like toothpaste, and ingredients to make sancochos (a traditional stew) and foods made with wheat flour, like arepas and empanadas, etc. With this investment, she plans to expend her sales and make more money than she usually makes at other times during the year. Her markets are the stores, workers, and patients in a nearby hospital. This is in addition to her neighbors, who like the products that Gregoria sells and buy them consistently.

Fatima's husband died suddenly. They started their own business together, but after his death she was left alone with the children with all of life's problems. The local administration paid benefits for a single mother of 3,500 KGS. \r\n\r\nDespite all the problems, she remains cheerful and upbeat. She firmly believes in the bright future of her family. \r\n\r\nAs the main source of the family's income, Fatima engages in raising livestock. Begun ten years ago, she and her husband bought a cow for 8,000 som (KGS) and today on her homestead she has two dairy cows and a horse. Her monthly income from the homestead is about 6,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the goal of developing her business, Fatima appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow and five sheep.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer (Minerva), and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than the retail prices in the catalogues, and this difference in the prices makes up the profits that dealers count on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional merchandise, like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other products her customers have ordered. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMinerva hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams that her youngest child will finish college. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1242782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

padres, que son sus vecinos trabajan. Astrid en esta actividad comunitaria, ha logrado conocer a muchas personas y se han convertido en sus principales clientes de su negocio, de venta de productos de tocador que distribuye a cr\u00e9dito. Este negocio lo aprendi\u00f3 de su madre, hace mas de 14 a\u00f1os, pues ella se dedicaba a la venta de mercanc\u00eda variada y la ense\u00f1\u00f3 a seleccionar a sus compradores de productos a cr\u00e9ditos, a recuperar las cuentas por cobrar y tambi\u00e9n sus padres le dieron un capital para que trabajara.

She learned this business from her mother more than 14 years ago since she worked selling assorted merchandise and taught her how to choose her beauty products credit customers, how to collect her accounts receivable and her parents also gave her initial capital to work with.  This is how she started and today it\u2019s a business that generates income she can support her home consisting of her spouse and three children aged between 6 and 15 with.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to multiply her sales and this is one of her greatest challenges because she does not have sufficient working capital to quickly increase them, especially during this end-of-year season when she\u2019s able to sell out everything she stocks.  This is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan to buy talc, cologne, shampoo, creams and hair products because her greatest goal is to expand her market; she will gradually accomplish this with well-applied business loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1243090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

en su domicilio, donde habita con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus dos hijos en las edades de 2 y 5 a\u00f1os, motores de su vida y la de su c\u00f3nyuge. Su experiencia data desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, porque su madre   tenia este taller , desde hace 18 a\u00f1os, por lo cual ella y sus hermanas desde su ni\u00f1ez permanec\u00edan entre telas y m\u00e1quinas de coser y se involucraron en este arte;  hasta el d\u00eda de hoy Marcela es la que mas se interes\u00f3 en convertir sus capacidades productivas de su taller,  en un generador de ingresos, para generar bienestar a su hogar. Ella presta el servicio de confecci\u00f3n de ropa femenina, masculina, a una clientela que ha construido poco a poco, entre vecinos, empleados de empresas, familiares y referidos y el de maquila, a empresas importantes,  adicionando con \u00e9ste \u00faltimo otros ingresos,  trabajados unida a su madre quien la asesora aun y a su esposo para que el trabajo com\u00fan sea m\u00e1s efectivo. Sus ventas las realizan  a cr\u00e9dito con una frecuencia semanal y trabaja en su taller desde las 8 e la ma\u00f1ana,  hasta las 6 de la tarde.   Su meta es ampliar el mercado,  incrementando la producci\u00f3n, especialmente a finales del a\u00f1o,  porque hay mucha mas rotaci\u00f3n de dinero y pedidos,  que los que  usualmente tiene en  otros periodos de a\u00f1o. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, con el que comprar\u00e1 telas, hilos, cierres y broches en mayor volumen y con ellos ganara muchos descuentos, pues los proveedores tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n haciendo sus mejores ofertas en esta \u00e9poca,  lo cual beneficia el potencial de \u00e9xito de su credikiva. ","en":"Marcela, who is 28, makes clothing in a little workshop in her home, where she lives with her husband and their two children, ages 2 and 5, the driving force for her life and that of her husband. Her experience dates from 10 years ago, because her mother had such a workshop for 18 years, and so she and her sisters lived among fabric and sewing machines and became involved in this art since their childhood. To this day, Marcela is the one who became most interested in converting her productive training in her mother's workshop into a generator of income, to create well-being in her household. She provides a service of making clothing for women and men for a customer base she has built little by little among neighbors, business employees, relatives, people referred to her, and assembly work for important businesses, which adds another source of income, as well as work she does with her mother, who still advises her and her husband so that the common work will be more effective.

","en":"Umeda is 21 years old. She is single and lives with his parents in the capital, where the economy and culture are developing rapidly. With the goal of receiving an education in economics, Umeda entered the Tadzikistan Technological University in 2008 with a major in World Economy. She is a fifth year student and is a very active participant in university life. She is an excellent student, and her classmates like her very much and value her friendship, for she is a good friend. She has lots of future plans and is trying to make these plans a reality. She wants to work in international organizations, since she is studying international economics. To realize these plans, she must graduate from the university and receive her degree, but her parents cannot afford to pay for her studies. Umeda's father works for an organization and is the family's only source of income; her mother is a housewife and earns no income. Umeda is applying for a loan of 600 US dollars to pay for her tuition. She is relying and depending solely on you. Let's work together and help such an outstanding, smart young woman play for her studies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1242770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Jihad is a hard worker, who puts much effort into developing his business, to provide his family a better living. Like almost all Palestinian refugees, he doesn't have a wide variety of business opportunities to seize -- that's why he has to develop what's available and improve it to be the best.\r\n\r\nJihad is requesting a Youth Loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to perform necessary maintenance on his house. He needs to keep it a healthy living place for his beloved family. This is his second cycle as Al Majmoua borrower, and he has a good standing repayment history. His previous loan helped him a lot in his business, by enabling him to renew his working tools. He hopes to stay capable of replying to his big family's needs, as much as he can.

She is married and raising two children. Her family lives under some very difficult economic and psychological conditions.  Her husband left for the Russian Federation to find employment as a migrant worker but he is not sending any money to help provide for the children.  She therefore tries to support the family by herself, without counting on any help from her husband.  She, alone, buys food, clothes for herself and the children, wood and coal for the winter.  She, alone, also has to pay for the children's school fees and to cover other expenses which require a lot of money.  She doesn't receive any money from her parents either, because their small income does not allow them to help.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at her options, Aydibegim has decided to focus on setting up her own business.  To this end, she enrolled in a course entitled \"Achieving Success\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and from which she has earned a certificate.  She can now start her business for good and become a successful entrepreneur.  She wants to get involved in animal husbandry, because she has experience in this field.  She will use her earnings to give her children a good education and to ensure that they eat a high-calorie diet.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 3,000 somoni to buy livestock to start her new business.  Aydibegim and her daughter are awaiting your kindness.

Blama. These teachers received a Kiva loan of 5,600,000 Leones, which they have repaid successfully. The 5,600,000 Leones loan has created a significant impact in the lives of these borrowers.

She is married. She owns a poultry farm \u2013 a business which she has been operating for two years. She employs two other people in this business. Her main challenge is the threat of poultry diseases, which can kill a whole batch, and the high cost of feeds. \r\n\r\nJosphine learnt about Milango from an employee who invited her to the group.

He joined the group because he believes women are trustworthy and hard-working, so he thought would take a page from their book and improve his livelihood and that of his family. Alex repairs shoes in the outskirts of his city, near a market. He started repairing shoes after realising there were no such services in the area, and yet the shoes bought by the low income earners in that area are not durable and therefore need constant repair. With the income from his repairs, Alex has been able to send two of his children to school. With the loan, he will buy a batch of old shoes, shoe polish and thread to increase his daily income. His dream is to change his business by buying a motorcycle; then if he accumulates enough profits, the motorcycle would help him to buy a plot of land and later build a house for his family. He is hard-working and forward-looking.

He is a hardware owner. His business has been in operation for four years. He is a married father of four school-age children. He joined Milango two years ago to access credit for business expansion. \r\n\r\nHe is applying for a loan of KES 41,850 to buy hardware stock, like timber and paints. Besides this business, Anthony is also a plumbing contractor. The main challenges to both businesses are high transportation costs and lack of capital for business expansion. \r\n\r\nAnthony\u2019s future aspiration is to sell the products both retail and wholesale.  He believes he can run the businesses fairly and buy a transportation machine from the additional income obtained from this loan. He is happy over such investment, for he knows this will help him provide for his

dedica a la venta de pescado, pero tambi\u00e9n es su socia  en la actividad que realiza. Tienen 3 hijos a quienes   cuidan,  protege y y esperan poder brindarles una buena educaci\u00f3n. El trabajo de Walter consiste en la siembra y cosecha de palma aceitera, se dedica al arado de la tierra, la fertiliza, etc. comenta que cuando sus plantas est\u00e1n en pleno proceso de crecimiento es necesario el riego continuo por el intenso calor que hay en la ciudad. Tambi\u00e9n tiene que cuidarlas de las plagas que atacan a esta especie de palmera.  El lugar donde realiza su trabajo esta a 50 kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad en una comunidad conocida como \u201cNeshuya\u201d, aqu\u00ed tiene 12 hect\u00e1reas de terreno los cuales esta cultivando y arando para la siembra.  Se inici\u00f3 en esta actividad  porque la mayor\u00eda de personas que viven en esta comunidad se dedican a este trabajo y hay facilidades que da el gobierno para conseguir semilla de esta planta.  Junto a su conviviente y  2 obreros los cuales contrata se dedican a la siembra, cuidado y cosecha de estas plantas. Considera rentable su negocio porque las \u201cFabricas Aceiteras\u201d est\u00e1n pagando un buen precio por la fruta de esta planta.

They have 3 children for whom they care, protect and hope to be able to offer a good education.  Walter grows and harvests palm oil.  He plows and fertilizes the land.  He tells us that when his plants are in the process of growing, it's necessary to irrigate them continuously because of the heat in the city.  He also has to protect them from pests that attack this species of palm.  He does his work 50 kilometers from the city in a community known as \"Neshuya.\"  Here he has 12 hectares of land, which he is cultivating and plowing for planting.\r\n\r\nHe started this business because the majority of people who live in this community do this work.  The government makes it easy to obtain seeds for this plant.  He does this work with his wife and two workers that he hires to plant, care for, and harvest his plants.  Before he started this business, he had problems generating economic income and couldn't support his family because he didn't have a steady job.  This is why he decided to start his own business to generate his own income.  He hopes in the future to increase his production and to increase his economic earnings.  This will be his fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He wants to keep making his payments on time.  He also knows that the group is made up of friendly and respectful people.  With the 1,500 PEN requested, he will buy manure, fertilizers, and tools like a machete, ax, etc.  And he will pay the workers that help him with his work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1243227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy manure, fertilizers, and tools like a machete and an ax.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-24T04:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-24T04:30:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":229.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":238.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":237.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":256.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":265.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":272.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":187.26,"local_amount":468.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":486.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188923},{"amount":94.97,"local_amount":237.43,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":246.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572820},{"amount":208.69,"local_amount":521.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":542.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868304},{"amount":109.08,"local_amount":272.69,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":283.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577122}],"funded_date":"2012-12-16T20:04:13Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":500663,"name":"Caroline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Caroline lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is home to the main campus of Moi University.

She lives in her own home together with her second husband who works in a sawmill and is also her business partner. She is raising two children for whom she hopes to provide a good education and quality of life. Lizbeth works selling baked goods such as orange biscuits, loaves of bread, manjar (a traditional dessert dish similar to pudding), marmalade, etc. She purchases these products from a well-known distributor called Productos Union. She works selling these products door to door, selling them to relatives, neighbors, and others. She got started in this line of work at her mother's suggestion that it was profitable, provided a flexible work schedule, and would allow her to be with her children. Her husband helps her distribute her goods, giving her a ride to the areas where her products are in demand. She notes that her business is indeed profitable because if she manages to sell all her merchandise she earns 50%. For this reason she works hard to get rid of all her goods. She describes how before she got into this line of work she had had a desire to help her husband with the daily expenses, but she was not able to because she didn't have a job. She is thankful for her mother who helped her get started in this work which allows her to earn income. She hopes to build her customer base in the future and to purchase her own vehicle for work. This will be her second loan with MFP. She enjoys working with this group because, despite being new, the people are kind to her and they assist her when she is in need. She is grateful for MFP for the financial support that it provides. The money requested will be used to purchase greater quantities of product such as orange biscuits, loaves of bread, manjar, marmalade, and other items.

He was asked to be an assistant and since then they worked as partners. Now he signed a contract with a company that requested the construction of 10 chicken coops. He has been working in this business for 21 years. He considers this job to be profitable since he makes more and more chicken coops and is called upon frequently due to positive references. He had financial difficulties starting this business and could not afford the tools he needed. This limited his work but now he expects to stay in this business to continue making money. At the moment, this will be his 10th loan with the MFP Institution. He is very enthusiastic and wants to continue being punctual. He is thankful for the institution since he was able to get a loan from them to acquire the tools he needed to work.

Her name is Aklimo.  She is 40 years old and is married with six children at home.  She does her best to stay on top of everything, from running her household to raising her children and also to starting her own business.  Her husband admires her, but he is not in a position to provide for her and the children's needs.  Aklimo has chickens which give the children eggs, but there is not even one egg left for her.  She should be able to give her children butter, dairy products and meat as well as clothing and education.  This is why she urgently needs to start her business and earn an income.  With this goal in mind, she completed the \"Get Ahead\" course organized by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She wants to start her business buying and selling livestock, as she has experience in this type of work.  With the income from her business, Aklimo plans on giving her children a good education and high-calorie foods.  She is asking for a loan of 2,000 somoni with which to buy livestock to start her new business.  She is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1242817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She has six children and has been doing this work for 19 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, crops, and her personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Gardening!' Her biggest challenge is 'Crop diseases'. She will use the loan to construct a dairy unit.\r\n\r\nLonah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Lower interest.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'I can develop myself through their funding.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

She is a widow with four children, and she is a very hard-working and cheerful woman who is always motivated.  She faces difficult living conditions, as there is nothing left from her husband.  She raised her children alone without any help.  Her children are grown, but to this day Oshurmo takes care of them herself.  She has very large expenses, as she needs to pay for her eldest child's wedding and her youngest child's education.  Besides that, the everyday expenses for food, clothing, mobile phone bills, transport and utilities fall to Oshurmo.  \r\n\r\nTo increase her income, Oshurmo plans to start her own business.

Her husband drives a tractor and she works as a teacher in a school, but receives a small salary.  Her husband's income is also not enough to provide for their family's needs, so Ravshangul decided to start her own business for the good of her family.  With that goal in mind, she enrolled in the \"Get Ahead\" course organized by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She wants to start a business buying and selling livestock.  With the income from this business, she plans to provide her children with a good education and high-calorie foods.  Ravshangul is asking for a loan of 2000 somoni to buy livestock to start her new business.  She is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1242857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She is 42 years old and has two children at home.  Her whole life she has shone a light on a school, which is to say that she is a high school teacher.  She loves her work very much and does it gladly, but her salary is very low and every year the economic situation of her family worsens.  Her husband also does not earn enough money to support the family, which is why Tahmina needed to find a source of income.  After much thought, she decided to start her own business.  With that goal in mind, she enrolled in the \"Get Ahead\" course offered by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She wants to start her own business buying and selling livestock.  This loan will help her start her new business and it will also open the door to economic development.  If her living conditions improve, then comfort and joy will rule her house.  Tahmina is asking for a loan of 3,000 somoni to buy livestock to start her new business.  She is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1242863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is extremely fertile for agriculture. She has four children and has been farming for 12 years. Her primary income sources are selling milk and eggs, growing crops, and transportation services.\r\n\r\nAnnlyne indicated that what is most enjoyable about farming is  'earning from the sale of milk!' Her biggest challenge is 'diseases in livestock.' One of the animals on the farm is named 'Lelmet'.She will use the loan amount specifically to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nAnnlyne was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'from  a neighbour.'  She was also asked about what she learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How to earn income from agriculture.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Annlyne replied, 'increased income to the family.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Annlyne owns the following: 'cow, poultry, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. Annlyne has the following items in her household 'mosquito net, solar power, TV' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine, DVD player'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and to send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1243289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"To

In 2006, she began her business with a start-up sum of only 3,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) She has managed to develop her farm, which now includes 1 cow and calf and 10 sheep, bringing in monthly earnings of 3,000 KGS. On her land, Nasipa grows barley and straw. She fattens cows and sells them at the local cattle market. For the purpose of further developing her business, Nasipa has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 30,000 Som (KGS) to buy more cattle.

named Akmaljon needs your help, since his parents aren't in a position to pay his tuition.  Akmaljon is 19 years old and a second year student at the Tajik Technical University.  He graduated from high school with excellent grades and presently, he is one of the best students at the university.  His classmates and teachers respect him for having all the traits of a good person:  tolerance, intellectuality, and motivation.  He recently had an end-of-semester assignment, for which he got good and excellent marks.\r\n\r\nThis talented student isn't subsidized by the government and must pay his tuition every year.  It's difficult for Akmaljon to deal with the expenses of student life as he himself has no source of income and his parents work in government bureaus where they receive small salaries.  He is requesting a loan for $1000 for the payment of his university tuition.  This loan will help him by paying his tuition to finish his second year and move closer to his goals.  He is relying only on you and he promises to repay the loan on time as his parents will help him with this.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1242800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

When they harvest the fruits, they transport them to the various markets of the city and sell them on a wholesale basis. She considers her business profitable, since the prices for citrus fruits are rising. When she began working in this area, she did not have sufficient knowledge about citrus fruits and did not have enough capital. Thus, she decided to become informed and get training, and she decided together with her partner to take out a loan to start her economic activity. She hopes to continue to maintain her business, which keeps growing day by day.

Maylin maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nMa. Maylin hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams of having their own house and lot. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1242005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To  purchase supplies and merchandise like perfume, powder, soap, deodorant, shampoo, lotion and other products needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-26T05:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-26T05:50:07Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

She previously accessed a loan of 15,000 PHP that she used to buy spare parts, accessories, and to maintain her tricycle unit. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and in their personal, household, and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 20,000 PHP loan to pay for spare parts and maintenance of her tricycle unit. The profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nSalvacion dreams of being able to give her children a high quality education through all her hard work. She hopes to have more tricycles.

When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Pamela replied, \"Assist in paying fees.\"\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Pamela owns the following: cow, bicycle, automobile, but does not own pig, poultry, pump, motorcycle. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

Her name is Turguntosh and she is 28 years old. She is married and has 3 children in her care. Her husband is a simple labourer, and his income does not allow him to provide his family with all necessities of life. Turguntosh had placed all her hopes in her husband and didn't find a job herself, but year after year their living conditions worsened. Turguntosh can no longer depend only on her husband, and has decided to start her own business cultivating crops such as potatoes, carrots, onions, grains etc. To this end, she took the course \"Bring It On\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained her graduation certificate. Now she is quite capable of setting up her own business and becoming successful. Turguntosh is planning to use her profits to provide her children with quality education and nutritious food.\r\n\r\nTurguntosh is requesting a loan of 1000 somoni to buy seeds and mineral fertilizers for her new business.

He started his business less than 2 years ago, taking into account the needs of his neighborhood for name and house number signs. He took charge of this and began to earn money. Today he has advanced with this business, since he has added alternative items for sale such as paintings on canvas and decorative ceramic items, which he sells door to door, sometimes for cash and other times on credit, working every day, 8 hours a day. His plan for the future is to achieve leadership on the national level, and for this he is working with efficiency and great responsibility. Currently, he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will use it to buy wood and ceramic bisque items, in addition to paintings. With these products he will maintain an inventory for his customers and will increase his potential sales in a market that is increasing each day. This is precisely his plan for success from the investment of the Kiva loan for which he is now applying.
