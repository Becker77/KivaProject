To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 2002, having started this business with 50,000 KGS.  The main business focus is selling meat and milk.  Thanks to Gulisar's hard work, today her business contains four dairy cows and five bulls, and the monthly income amounts to 8,000 som.  Her daughter and husband actively help her with the business.  In order to further develop her business, Gulisar requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy two bulls and two cows.  The bulls will be used for fattening up and subsequent butchering, and the cows for increasing milk volumes.  Gulisar plans to use the earnings from the loan to invest into a further expansion of her business by increasing the quantity of cows and bulls.

The car, which all Mongolian people\u2019s using, has too big engine, so it uses 10-12 liter petrol per 100 kilometer. The study showed that average car, which runs on petrol, emits 135g CO2 per km to atmosphere. And also the petrol contains harmful ingredients like zinc, lead and others, to people\u2019s health and the environment. Economically, riding a car with big engine in Mongolia is not rational, because Mongolia imports fuel products from the neighbors and its price always rises. \n\nAltantuya is asking a loan to buy a car, which runs on a natural gas. She already paid part of the money, but still owes 3,500,000 MNT to the seller. The reason he is asking for this loans is to pay the rest of the money for her car.

In winter, the heat goes out through the door and the house gets colder, so they need to use a coal-burning stove to keep warm. Coal burning is becoming the primary source of air pollution in Mongolia. \n\nTherefore, Delgerkhangai is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT so a small barn can be built where the house door opens outside.

Se\u00f1ora Elsa in particular is very sociable. In the photo she can be seen dressed in blue, on the left. She is 39 years old, is married, and has four children, of whom only two depend on her. Out of the need to progress and be able to give a better quality of life to her children, she decided to outfit part of her house and thus begin a food business, since she has a good sense of taste. \n\nThis is her primary activity. Her secondary activity is the sale of all kinds of decorations and ornmanents, but only in special occasions such as national holidays and Christmas. She will use the loan to buy some Christmas products and also for some of the essential expenses for things that her little children need. The group \"Vecindad del Cinco\" is grateful to all the people who help them through Kiva and Edaprospo. Se\u00f1ora Elsa gives a personal testimony and says, \"I feel happy and content that people from different parts of the world can help me to continue growing as a person, a woman, and a mother. I promise to continue advancing and within a short time I want to be able to open a bigger food business and share this story with you.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1243020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase toys and Christmas ornaments ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Vitarte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.033333 -76.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2012-11-26T16:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-26T16:50:18Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ermanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhojanna Dilsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1332},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1332},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1332},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1332},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1332},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1340}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":516.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":516.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":516.15,"local_amount":1332,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1340.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331113845},{"amount":516.15,"local_amount":1332,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1340.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339505385},{"amount":516.15,"local_amount":1332,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1340.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347057336},{"amount":516.15,"local_amount":1332,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1340.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355803067},{"amount":516.15,"local_amount":1332,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1340.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364511396},{"amount":519.25,"local_amount":1340,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1349.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372916794}],"funded_date":"2012-12-20T16:45:31Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:06:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":501092,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is 57 years old, married, and has two children.

Both sons have congenital eye problems: the eldest son is 27 years old with only 50% vision, while the younger, only 11 years old, has only 30% vision. Consequently, the family always has extra costs. \r\n\r\nMariya needs a loan of 15,000 hryvnia (UAH) in order to purchase seeds, chemical fertilizer, firewood for heating, and plastic sheeting for greenhouses. Mariya eventually hopes to build yet another greenhouse to expand her household business. With the additional profit from these investments, Mariya hopes to invest in vision correction surgery for one of her sons.

He is planning to acquire more acres of land in the near future in order to increase his farming. \r\n\r\nLike any other farmer, Obadiah has several challenges in this business. He has experienced several losses due to bad weather conditions and lack of enough money to buy farm supplies that will help improve his produce. He is grateful to Juhudi that now he will comfortably face these challenges with their financial support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1244020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

She has a nice life living with Wilmer, 28, and her one-year-old daughter, Maribel, who is her reason to live.  She lives with her family in a rented adobe house.  She\u2019s been growing organic cocoa beans for ten years which by the way is one of the best priced in the region for its unique flavor and aroma.  Her main, unfailing support is Wilmer with whose help she negotiates everything related to the crops; they almost always work from sun to sun including Sundays and holidays.  She does all this because in all the time she\u2019s been working in the fields she came to realize that as long as her health remains stable, she must get the most out of it with hard work and joy never forgetting that effort applied is reflected eventually in profits obtained that make it possible for her to save up in the long run.\r\n\r\nShe currently plans to make a list of tasks for the crops that includes replacing some of the coca leaf plants with cocoa bean plants because she considers them to be a bit obsolete.  This process requires the purchase of seedlings that have been raised technologically and she must add the respective weeding of the currently most productive plots.\r\n\r\nShe hopes in future to reach one of her dreams which is the purchase of a dwelling in her local residential area because it\u2019s one of the things she\u2019s always wanted for her daughter\u2019s wellbeing.  This will be her 4th MFP loan and she\u2019s grateful to be part of the financial institution and to have a good credit history.  She feels committed to the work the communal group has been doing because she feels motivated to work with people who are responsible and committed to their loans.  She will use the 500 new soles to add to her capital earmarked for seedling purchase and will use the rest to hire day laborers for crop maintenance and to weed the cocoa bean plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1244379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Barihan is a 47 year old farmer who lives in the village of Ak-Kolot in the south Kyrgyzstan. She is married and a mother of four children. Three of her children are adults and are taking care of themselves and their own families. Only Barihan's youngest son is still living at home. The entire family helps their mother during the spring planting season. Barihan has a calm, hardworking and responsive personality. She has been raising livestock since 1992 and the herd has become the main source of income for the family. After the fall of the Soviet Union Barihan received a plot of land from the co-op and also owns 30 sheep and 2 cows. In order to further expand the herd she has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She is planning to use the profits from this loan to buy even more livestock and hopefully marry off her last son next year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1244185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He owned a coffee shop for 10 years until he sold it to his business partner, and he has storage and warehouse buildings he rents out. After he learned about computer software by working at his church, Destin took a class on technology. He said he saw an opportunity for business growth and decided to change industries. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Destin owns one kiosk and says he has the approval to set up in his neighborhood mall. He provides options for clients, including already-made kiosks similar to ones seen at major department stores set to accept job applications - and a way-finder, similar to ones in malls, with informational slides.  \u201cI think what makes my business so unique is that it\u2019s an outlet to release information,\u201d Destin says.  \u201cIf you pass a billboard on the street, you may not get all the information, but a kiosk is more intimate. You can read and take it in.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about Accion Texas Inc. in a radio ad, Destin applied for a loan to get his business started.  He used the loan to purchase a demo phone-charging kiosk to pitch his business to potential clients. The charging port takes 15 minutes maximum to fully charge a dead smart phone and comes with Android and iPhone connectors. Without the help of Accion, Destin says, the momentum of his business would have slowed down.\r\n\r\nThough his business was registered only a year and a half ago, Destin plans to purchase iPads to include in kiosks for doctors\u2019 offices, in which staff can obtain patient information and patients can make payments.  As his business grows, Destin plans to hire staff, but for the time being he employs himself and his wife.

And as he wishes to better develop his work, he is asking today for a loan from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l to purchase needed tools and renovate his shop. This step will facilitate his business, allowing him to receive more clients and serve them rapidly. Kassem has just started his career; that\u2019s why a Kiva loan will be way good for him to expand his business and increase his earnings.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union Bubuhariya got her share of collective farm land, 25 years ago as her main source of income, Bubuhariya started engaging in animal husbandry and field crop cultivation, having started this business with the amount of 10.000 KGS. \n\nThrough hard work in her business Bubuhariya today has one bull and monthly income from the business is about 20,000 KGS. In order to further develop her business, Bubuhariya turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100.000 som (KGS) for the purchase of milk cows. Proceeds from loan Bubuhariya plans to invest in further increasing the number of livestock. In the future, she plans to build a house in the village for her son so that under the old age she can quietly look after her grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1239984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a milk cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Petrovka village, Chui region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-11-26T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-26T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":53.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bubuharia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25126.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458845},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":25126.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776916},{"amount":528.99,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25126.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.26,"payment_id":479053127},{"amount":479.85,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25126.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":51.4,"payment_id":561577947}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T09:53:02Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T10:49:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":501153,"name":"Oyunjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Oyunjargal is a 30-year-old single woman who lives with her grandmother in a ger (a traditional Mongolian nomadic felt housing tent, similar to a yurt)\tin the Uvurhangai province of Mongolia.

The job gave him and his family a stable source of income and allowed him to try to start his own jewelry repair business from home.\n\nJesus now operates the business together with his daughter from a small store front location. During the day, Jesus teaches his daughter the precise skills required for watch repair, with the dream that she can one day take over the business.\n\nHe still maintains his janitor job in the evenings, working many hours each day to continue to grow and further improve the life of his family. \n\nTheir $5,000 Kiva loan will give Jesus and Jessica the opportunity to purchase extra inventory so they can diversify their product and service offerings in time for the holiday season. They will also be able to purchase an engraving machine, which will generate extra income.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1241625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics

She sells ornamental saplings at the local open market. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was always rejected, due to lack of experience in a new business. Experience is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nLali requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with easier conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lali will purchase used clothing and sell it from her house among her neighbors. She will begin her entrepreneurial activity with a wide assortment of merchandise and high sales volume. This will increase the family's income. \r\n\r\nShe wants to develop her business further and reinvest the increased income in trading. The new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He lives in Martvili District, West Georgia. Avtandil has a large family: a wife, 2 children and parents, who are provided with a retirement pension. He requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from their agricultural activities. In particular, they have 2 milk cows whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides, Avtandil has a plot of land where 300 nut trees are growing. Harvested nuts and cheese are sold locally in an open market at a good price.  It is hardly enough for food for such a large family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAvtandil requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nAs their existing income isn\u2019t enough for the family, and their living conditions are poor, Avtandil decided to work as a taxi driver with his own car. Avtandil needs the requested credit for repairing his own car. Besides, he will purchase 2 pigs and expand his livestock. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the

The family runs an agricultural business and cultivates family-owned land growing eggplant, cucumbers and maize. The harvested products are sold at the local open market. Jumber also runs a small chemist\u2019s shop and has a monthly income. Several times, he has asked for loans from local financial institutions to start his new business but without success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of income requirements and a lack of experience in new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers.\r\nJumber\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit. The program extends soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Jumber will cover the costs of purchasing his stock of basic groceries for starting a grocery store. He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually.

She is married and has 4 children with 3 of them currently in school. For the past 2 years, Flavia has been working hard to manage her go\/retail shop, which sells essential goods like rice, soap, cooking oil, and so forth. \n\nTo help expand her business, Flavia has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to pay rent for her shop and buy more commodities like rice to be sold. This loan will also help Flavia to generate greater profits and add to her income. Flavia hopes that in the future she will be able to set up a wholesale store. \n\nFlavia is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Flavia who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1228010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

widow whose husband was murdered in 2009.  She was left with her six children of which three go to school.\nAnnet operates a small restaurant along the Northern bypass where she earns a living for her family. She started this job in 1996 as supplement to the husband\u2019s income before he passed on. Annet\u2019s major clients are boda boda (a cycle equipped with a passenger seat) cyclists, builders and passers by along the road.\nHer dream is to see her children successfully finishing school and getting good jobs.\nHer major challenge is lack of capital which slows down the growth of her business. This does not only affect her business but also her family\u2019s standard of living since she\u2019s now the family bread winner.\nAnnet is very hardworking, social and honest.

He lives with his wife and two children (2 and 4 years old) in Batumi city. In fact, the family doesn't have a source of income and they live in poverty. So, Jemal decided to move to his village and rent his house to get a monthly income. He requested a loan from local financial institutions for the business start-up without any success. His loan request was rejected because of his low income and lack of experience in the business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the loan, Jemal will cover the costs of installing natural gas piping inside his house.

They have been together for a considerable length of time, and their loving relationship has produced 4 children: Alfredo, Reyna, Edwin and Ruth. Their home was built using quality construction materials. \r\n\r\nShe is a tireless worker and puts a lot of effort and dedication into her work caring for and producing cacao. She has been doing this kind of work for 20 years on plots of land that she acquired in the days after their wedding. As many people know, working in the fields is both arduous and exhausting. For this reason, on more than one occasion it has been necessary to get additional support and help from local labourers. With their assistance unfinished tasks can be completed quickly. This can result in a higher quality harvest by the end of the season due to the attention given to the crop. She believes that this makes sense because when she sells her goods to the local middlemen she can make good earnings. This in turn helps stabilise her family\u2019s economic situation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the technical studies carried out by the institution expert in the field, she noticed that her plots of land did not offer the shade required in order for the cacao plants to develop strong pods. For this reason she must plant trees immediately that will give temporary shade and grow quickly, such as the banana tree. This is why she must take on extra staff, to support her and her husband with this task. She must also weed the plots, as the weeds compete with the crops for nutrients, and carry out other crop maintenance work. \r\n\r\nIn the future she plans to buy land in the city and to build a house there for her children. They are school age now and she thinks it is good to give them a quality education which would only be available in the urban part of her area. This will be her fourth loan.

convertirse en comerciante, est\u00e1 casado con Susana de 51 a\u00f1os, tienen 3 hijos ya adultos de 34, 32 y 21 a\u00f1os. Vive con su esposa en el sur de la ciudad de Quito capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, espec\u00edficamente en el barrio de Chimbacalle un barrio muy emblem\u00e1tico de Quito principalmente por ser la morada de la \u00fanica Estaci\u00f3n de trenes de la capital la cual se convertir\u00e1 en un museo ferroviario que a la par con los museos de su alrededor se ha convertido en uno de los lugares tur\u00edsticos m\u00e1s visitados del pa\u00eds. Sumado a este atractivo, en general, el sector sur de la ciudad de Quito en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente tanto urbana y econ\u00f3micamente, es as\u00ed que inversionistas han apostado para sembrar sus ideas en varios puntos clave de este sector. La competencia para microempresarios es muy fuerte, pues se puede encontrar negocios de todo tipo en cada paso.  Chimbacalle alberga grandes historias de hombres y mujeres luchadoras que han encontrado en este lugar alto de la ciudad, la oportunidad de ver sus sue\u00f1os cumplidos y adem\u00e1s de ser parte del crecimiento de este sector de la ciudad. \nJos\u00e9 se ha dedicado a comercializar verduras y frutas desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, cuando aprendi\u00f3 de un gran amigo de la Costa ecuatoriana a quien le ayudaba en esta actividad. No recibe ayuda de personas adicionales, solo en su local trabaja al menos 8 horas diarias. Muchas veces no puede abastecer los pedidos de sus clientes porque no cuenta con los productos solicitados. Sin embargo con su experiencia, \u00e9l afirma que sus ingresos mejorar\u00edan si invierte en surtir sus productos. Por esta raz\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 acudi\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito con el cual pueda hacer realidad esta idea. Jos\u00e9 espera que invirtiendo este dinero y poniendo en pr\u00e1ctica la asesor\u00eda que su ejecutivo le brinda con herramientas para la buena administraci\u00f3n de su negocio; \u00e9l pueda incrementar la utilidad de su negocio para tener un ahorro que en el futuro le permita adquirir un cami\u00f3n para distribuir al por mayor a otros sectores de la ciudad y de la provincia. Jos\u00e9 agradece la intermediaci\u00f3n de Kiva para que varias personas alrededor del mundo participen en el cumplimiento de sus sue\u00f1os. ","en":"Jos\u00e9 is a 54-year-old man who studied secondary education but later became a merchant.  He is married to Susana who is 51 years old.  They have three adult children who are 34, 32 and 21 years old.  He lives with his wife in the south of the city of Quito, the capital of the Republic of Ecuador, specifically in the neighborhood of Chimbacalle, a very emblematic neighborhood of Quito.  This is mainly because it is the dwelling place of the only train station in the capital which will be converted into a railway museum that, on par with the surrounding museums, has become one of the most visited tourist places in the country.  Together with this attraction, in general, the southern sector of the city of Quito in recent years has developed considerably, both in an urban and economic sense.  So investors have positioned themselves to sow their plans in several key places in this sector.  The competition for small-businessmen is very strong, as one can find all kinds of businesses at every step.  Chimbacalle harbors great stories of fighting men and women who have found in this high place in the city the opportunity to see their dreams fulfilled and also to be part of the growth of this area of the city.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has made a living selling vegetables and fruits for 15 years from the time when he learned from a great friend from the Ecuadoran coast who was helping him in this activity.  He doesn\u2019t receive any help from additional people, he works alone in his business location at least 8 hours a day.  Many times he can\u2019t supply the orders of his customers because he doesn\u2019t have the requested products.  However, with his experience he states that his income would improve if he invests in stocking up on his products.  For this reason Jos\u00e9 turned to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to request a loan with which he can make this idea a reality.  Jos\u00e9 hopes that by investing this money and putting into practice the advice that his manager provides him with the tools for good administration of his business, he can increase the utility of his business to have a savings that in the future will allow him to purchase a truck to distribute wholesale to other sectors of the city and of the province.  Jos\u00e9 is grateful for the intermediation of Kiva so that various people around the world participate in the fulfillment of his dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1244534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

He is Lebanese and single. He lives with his parent and two siblings, one of whom is working. His brother is supporting him, especially after finding it hard to cover the usual family expenses. \r\n\r\nHani has owned a cattle farm in his town, where he raised cattle from which he obtained dairy products. He has been involved in this domain for many years; he knows very well how to manage his work in a good way.

weren\u2019t run by him.  He is always looking for new challenges.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my passion to do business,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to sell and connect with people. It\u2019s in my blood to do business.\u201d His venture, GM Jewelry Watches, is an eBay.com business that sells brand name, warranty backed watches, which he purchases in bulk directly from the manufacturer.  Originally from Pakistan, Muhammad currently resides in Houston.\r\n\r\nIn order not to get lost amid the huge number of watches sold on eBay, Muhammad says he takes about 16 photos and leaves a detailed description of each item.  This allows for a better and more thorough online customer experience.\r\n\r\nWhen he first moved to the United States, Muhammad tried selling cars and auto parts and working in the construction business, but didn\u2019t like any of these career paths because they can be slow to return profits.  Then one day he looked into selling watches online and realized he could create a very positive and profitable enterprise. \u201cI sell my watches within three to seven days,\u201d he says. He credits his success to past customers who refer their friends and family members.  He sells about 90 watches a month.\r\n\r\nGM Jewelry was launched in early 2012 and, as sales picked up in the first quarter, Muhammad found he needed a loan to purchase more inventory.  In his native country, he had established a good relationship with a bank that worked with small businesses.  With no such contacts in Houston, he started searching online and spoke with various lenders.  He was eventually referred to ACCION Texas Inc.\r\n\r\n\u201cI went to Google to find ACCION\u2019s number, called it, and within three to four weeks, I was done,\u201d Muhammad says. \r\n\r\nHe plans to pay off this loan within six months and then apply for a larger one.  The loan will make a great difference to his business, he says, because he\u2019ll be able to purchase more inventory, make more sales and earn a larger profit. \r\n\r\n\u201cI was born in a business-oriented family and have 30 years\u2019 experience in business. I\u2019ve always done sales and marketing and I\u2019m very excited with my life.  I praise my God that he has blessed me with good companies like ACCION that guided me every step. This isn\u2019t my first loan, but it is my first loan in America.\u201d"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1244394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Houston, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2012-11-27T02:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-27T02:50:01Z","loan_amount":5200,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhammad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5175.41,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":5200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":151.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":185.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":187.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":196.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":193.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":197.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":198.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":203.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":204.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":207.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":212.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":213.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":218.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":219.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":223.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":229.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":229.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":233.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":236.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":240.31},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":243.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":246.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":251.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.47},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.8},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":501370,"name":"Ana Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana Banana\u2019s Snack Shop was established in 2012 by Ana as a snack shop that will provide Mexican and American themed meals and snacks.

They live in their wooden house in the ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity, in Kherlen, the third largest city in Mongolia. His son is studying at the university in Ulaanbaatar city and his daughter is attending secondary school. Geser's wife is a shop assistant at a local company, but a couple of months ago she had an operation on her stomach.  Geser is working as a watchman and working 24 hours. After work he is resting 48 hours and during this time he is running a taxi business in his own car.\r\n\r\nHe is very thankful to Kiva lenders for helping to expand his living conditions. In the winter, his house passes its heat through the door and gets colder, so they need to use a coal-burning stove to stay warm. The coal burning is becoming the primary source of air pollution in Mongolia, so Geser is requesting 3,000,000 MNT to build a small barn where the house door meets with the outside. By doing this, he can reduce the heat loss in his house, he will burn less coal and his family will live in comfortable conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2118.44,"image":{"id":1244625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is married to Ernesto and is a mother to her children. She, together with her children, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide an income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMyrna operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others. Aside from this, she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMyrna hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1244626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled

She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRebecca hopes to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

After her husband died, Aiymbubu was left with her son, who is a reliable support for his mother.  They have a small store in their village where they sell food products.  As the main source of income for her family, Aiymbubu also raises animals and manages the farm.  Beginning with the sum of 5,000 som (KGS), their household now brings in 8,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and dairy products.  Aiymbubu's farm currently has six dairy cows and 15 goats.  With the goal of increasing her business, Aiymbubu turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 55,000 som (KGS) to buy two bulls.  After fattening them up, she can resell them at the local market.  With this income, Aiymbubu plans on investing in further increasing her head of livestock and she dreams of buying an apartment in the city of Karakol."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1244843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bayzak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-11-27T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-27T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aiymbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":363.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":811.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":875.33,"local_amount":40973,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":41394.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776924},{"amount":95.92,"local_amount":4490,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4536.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942376},{"amount":30.98,"local_amount":1450,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1464.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552810},{"amount":172.77,"local_amount":8087,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8170.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178007}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T20:23:57Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:09:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":501549,"name":"Jonathan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Jonathan, 22, a resident of Cabrera, Philippines.

He has five children. He describes himself as a profit-oriented man. \r\n\r\nCrispin operates a retail store where he sells household items such as sugar, salt, maize flour, tea leaves, detergents, plastic items, cooking fat, etc. He has been involved in this business for 10 years. His business is located in a highly populated area and his primary customers are schools, residents and tourists.

She has raised 5 children, the youngest of whom is a student, while the rest are adults and earn their own living. Kenjebu's husband actively helps her around the house. Kenjebu has vocational post-secondary education. She is a very calm and positive woman, who always believes in the bright future for her family, but never forgets the harsh realities of life.\r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for her family, Kenjebu raises livestock and cultivates crops. Additionally, for many years she has been preparing and selling traditional non-alcoholic beverages. Her business, launched with an initial investment of 15,000 som (KGS) after the break-up of the USSR, presently earns roughly 15,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and dairy products. Currently, Kenjebu's farm includes 2 dairy cows, 1 mare, 15 sheep, 10 chickens, and one beautiful yurt.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Kenjebu has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 135,000 som (KGS) to purchase 3 dairy cows. The cows will produce additional milk, and so Kenjebu will be able to prepare a larger volume of traditional beverages."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":1244903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy RTW products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAlice hopes to be able to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1244767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional stocks of merchandise like undergarments, socks, jeans, dresses and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-27T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-27T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3418.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960454},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2735.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095205},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2735.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484354},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1367.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036866}],"funded_date":"2012-11-27T23:15:27Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":501772,"name":"Yelen Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Yelen est un regroupement de 6 femmes qui se sont connues \u00e0 travers des liens de parent\u00e9 et de voisinage.

Following several years experience with her sister, Korotoumou chose the same business, that is general trading in articles such as beauty products, food products, head jewelry etc. Having fully repaid the first loan, she is on her second loan with Soro Yiriwaso - which will be used to purchase twenty bags of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 (sort of couscous made from sweet potatoes), three boxes of hairbrushes, three boxes of toothpaste and two boxes of clothing dye.\r\nShe buys from wholesalers in Bamako, and makes her sales for both cash and credit, on a retail basis door to door, in the market in Ouelessebougou, and in surrounding fairs - to both male and female customers. \r\nKorotoumou hopes to generate a monthly profit of 60,000 FCFA which she will use to help her husband with the family's expenses, to repay the loan, and to invest further in her activities.

married with four children.  The three older children have families of their own.  Her eldest son works in livestock and helps her youngest son.  Her husband and younger son help out actively on the farm.  Thanks to her perseverance and diligence, the family has achieved a lot of success.  As the family's chief breadwinner, Hurihon earns her living growing crops and breeding livestock.  She started out forty years ago with 5,000KGS and today the farm brings in nearly 10,000KGS per month.  At present the farm has two bulls and five heads of sheep, and .91 hectares of land where the family grows potatoes and corn.  To further the business, Hurihon has turned to Bai-Tulum for a loan of 75,000KGS so she can buy three bulls to fatten up for sale in five or six months.  Her plans include building a fence around the house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1244968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 3 bulls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulbahor village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-11-27T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-27T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hurihon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":37000},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":38000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":789.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":810.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":789.33,"local_amount":37000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":37328.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631510},{"amount":810.67,"local_amount":38000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":38336.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776926}],"funded_date":"2012-12-17T21:45:24Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:17:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":501632,"name":"Margie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magie is a 46-year-old resident of Sto.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nGloria operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like rice, pork, vegetables, chicken, fish and other ingredients. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nGloria hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of having an abundant life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance
