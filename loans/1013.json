She is a great woman, and mother to Deyvis who is one year old. When she was 21 years old she was able to become independent, so that she could provide her little one with the best possible, as a result of her work and efforts. She currently lives in an adobe home, which she is renting. \r\n\r\nShe has seven years of experience cultivating cacao and other local products, thanks to a piece of land that her parents provided her with to be able to make her own income. She admits that it is not easy work, and that it is often necessary to hire local day laborers to remove unwanted plants that compete for the nutrients that are needed by the cacao trees in order for the fruit to have optimal growth.  \r\n\r\nShe is happy with her crops because a good amount of time has passed since her plants have been afflicted by anything bad or by tropical disease that directly harm cacao plantations. However, the rainy season does affect the normal care of the crop because the plot of land is positioned on an incline.  \r\n\r\nAfter all of these years of work, she has been presented with a good opportunity to buy a plot of land that will finally allow her to work towards her future plans of building her own home.

This passionate farmer is married to Mr. Cornelius and together they have been blessed with one 3-year-old child. She has been in this business for three years now and from the look in her eyes you can tell how passionate she is about farming. Her mixed farm, which is located in the outskirts of Kitale town in western Kenya, produces milk, vegetables, eggs, and chickens which are all sold locally.\r\n\r\nConcefta (pictured with her favorite dairy cow) has made her first loan request through Juhudi Kilimo of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings). She intends to use this loan to buy additional chickens and chicken feeds for her poultry farm. The income from the sale of eggs will boost her family's income and improve their livelihood. She plans to expand her dairy and poultry farm in the near future to increase her income. Her challenges are animal diseases and the high cost of farm inputs, which affects her production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1244894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens and chicken feeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2012-11-27T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-27T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concefta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.17,"local_amount":2157,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2161.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331168380},{"amount":51.66,"local_amount":4428.04,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T08:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4436.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347304802},{"amount":27.2,"local_amount":2331.06,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2335.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355845999},{"amount":28.5,"local_amount":2442.68,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2447.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768367},{"amount":29.25,"local_amount":2507.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516443},{"amount":30.02,"local_amount":2573.53,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2578.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960055},{"amount":30.82,"local_amount":2641.55,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2646.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390819780},{"amount":63.27,"local_amount":5422.76,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5433.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980411},{"amount":34.05,"local_amount":2918.76,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880439},{"amount":30.06,"local_amount":2531.87,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529077}],"funded_date":"2012-11-27T21:43:52Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T17:29:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morgan Kelley","image":null}},{"id":501678,"name":"Mila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mila is 55 years old and lives in the town of Arua hill in the Arua region of Uganda.

","en":"Victor, 61, grew up in a family of scarce economic resources so when he finished elementary school he started to help his parents working hard doing  heavy work.  Now, he\u2019s married to Georgina, 72, and they\u2019ve gone through obstacles together like the inability to have children since treatments were very costly.  However, they\u2019ve gotten ahead and live in Latacunga, capital of Cotopaxi Province, one of the provinces that make up the Sierra Region of Ecuador and that in recent years has developed significantly  and is now considered one of the region\u2019s most important thanks to the flower growing industry, mining, metallurgy, agroindustry, agriculture and animal husbandry.  In addition, there are businesses established here that generate important income transforming it into a commercial city with several opportunities for getting ahead.  Although there\u2019s a high poverty index, the enterprising spirit of its residents has made the city stand out.  Families can be found both in the rural and urban sectors that stand out because of their skills in taking off with an idea that can generate profits for them in order to obtain daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nVictor learned from his parents how to manufacture concrete blocks and thanks to his enterprising spirit has been doing this work for the last 32 years.  He works every day for between 10 and 12 hours and even this is not enough to meet customer demand mainly because production is time consuming and requires much care.  \r\n\r\nVictor is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a loan to buy materials and to pay a person to help him with production so that he can offer a larger number of bricks and attract more customers and increase his profits that he\u2019ll use to support him and his wife for a stable future with good health and also to pay some pending tax debts.  Victor is thankful for Kiva\u2019s involvement in being part of this step towards growth both in his work and in his family

She is 40 years old, married and lives with her family: her husband and two children (23 and 14 years old).  Her younger son goes to the local school. The main source of income for the family is the small monthly salaries of Nato\u2019s husband and her elder son. Her husband works as a cook and her son is an artisan.  Nato runs a small agricultural business. In particular, she has two milk cows whose milk is used in cheese products. The family sells hens as well and piglets seasonally.  \r\n\r\nNato has requested loan from local financial institutions several times for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers.  Her loan request with Credo was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo.  This start-up loan program envisages provisioning credits with soft conditions for business start-up and re-startup to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nNato will purchase clothes in Tbilisi for wholesale prices and resell them in her village for a profit. It will be hard work for Nato, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of her family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the clothing trading business to increase her stocks and sales volume. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living conditions, and Nato will be able to finance the education of her child. She awaits your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1245008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Benancio and his family share a home made of wood, which he acquired at a very young age with the help of his parents.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe inherited a few plots of land from his grandparents, but he was able to expand his acreage by purchasing some additional plots that adjoined that property.  Benancio has six years of experience in this line of work.  He has several cacao trees since this area is well-suited for producing organic crops that are of high quality.  In addition, farming is an activity that has been practiced by his family for many generations.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order for the work to be done correctly, Benancio needs the help of workers who are reliable people from the area.  They will be able to complete the outstanding tasks in a shorter period of time.  This type of uniform and efficient maintenance is reflected in the final harvest.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the next growing season, Benancio plans to hire outside help to maintain his cacao trees.  He knows that cacao groves require weed removal three times throughout the season.  The first removal is usually the most difficult and detailed.  In addition, he wants to have organic compost and small tools available so that the outstanding work can be completed.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis goal for the future is to convert his business into a small-scale collection center of agricultural products.  Benancio hopes that the large-scale distributors will want to work with him in the future, which will create an opportunity for him to improve his family\u2019s financial condition.  This is the second time he has requested a loan from MFP.  Thanks to this loan, he will have everything he needs to invest in his farming business so that it will run smoothly.  Benancio and his fellow Communal Bank members share the same motivation, so he is grateful to be part of a group that is responsible and demonstrates great camaraderie.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 1,500 PEN, Benancio will hire workers for the first round of weed removal from his cacao grove.  Any remaining funds will be used to buy sacks of organic compost, including bird droppings.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1245320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire workers and to buy sacks of organic compost.

Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. En esta ciudad muchas de las fiestas conservan un profundo arraigo y pureza muy cercanos a los or\u00edgenes hist\u00f3ricos o de la tradici\u00f3n ancestral. En cada fiesta la comida t\u00edpica, los bailes y las presentaciones art\u00edsticas son el centro de atenci\u00f3n de todos los habitantes y turistas.

","en":"Juan, 53, attended elementary school.  He\u2019s married to Carmen, 51, and they have two children who are 14 and 11 years old.  They live in Latacunga, capital of Cotopaxi Province one of the provinces that make up Ecuador\u2019s Sierra Region.  Latacunga has developed significantly in recent years to such an extent that it\u2019s considered to be one of the most important in the region thanks to its flower industry, mining, metallurgy, agroindustry, agriculture and animal husbandry.  Businesses that generate interesting income are also established here converting the city into a commercial center with several growth opportunities.  Many festivals occur in this city preserving the roots and purity of historical origins and ancestral traditions.  At every festival, traditional food, dances and artistic presentations are the center of attention for all inhabitants and tourists.  Some of the dishes that are served in this city are \u2018hornado\u2019 [roasted pig], guinea pigs, \u2018chugchucaras\u2019 [fried pork, 'mote'-boiled hominy, potatoes, fried plantains, turnovers, popcorn, and pork rinds; it is accompanied by aji, a spicy sauce made with hot peppers, tomatoes, cilantro, and onions], etc.\r\n\r\nJuan has worked for a year raising animals for subsequent sale.  It was quite a challenge for him and his family to start something new but the experience his friends and neighbors shared with him helped him to feel confident about continuing forward and he\u2019s done excellent work despite having worked for a long time manufacturing concrete blocks.  The little space he had available at home, however, made it impossible for him to continue with this so now he uses his free time to help out in nearby block factories.\r\n\r\nRaising animals has now become his main source of employment and he spends between six and eight hours daily at it; his wife helps him and they work together even at dawn to tend to their animals and care for their health so that they will be in higher market demand.  Juan is prepared to take the next step for his business\u2019 growth so wants to buy more animals to earn higher income that will help him improve his and his family\u2019s quality of life.  To reach this goal, Juan has asked Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a loan he can use to make this purchase and also to obtain the training he needs to correctly manage his business and the resources that are being invested in it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1245324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy piglets and chicks to raise and then sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-11-27T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-27T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":643.6,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":59.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":61.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.19,"local_amount":59.6,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":60.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126228},{"amount":61.69,"local_amount":61.08,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":61.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516822},{"amount":62.6,"local_amount":61.98,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":62.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068678},{"amount":128.62,"local_amount":127.35,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":128.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494944},{"amount":65.55,"local_amount":64.9,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":65.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524873},{"amount":66.34,"local_amount":65.7,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":66.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313721},{"amount":67.42,"local_amount":66.75,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":67.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565326},{"amount":137.59,"local_amount":136.24,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":137.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814373}],"funded_date":"2012-12-06T15:23:20Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":501933,"name":"Marco Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Marco, tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, tiene dos hijos, vive en el municipio de Taulabe, Comayagua. don Marco, siempre se ha dedicado al comercio anteriormente solo vend\u00eda y reparaba relojes y art\u00edculos pl\u00e1sticos.

She lives in her own home together with her second husband, who makes his living in multiple areas.  He is a construction worker and a taxi driver, etc.  They are raising their three children, who are 15, 6 and 3 years old.  All three go to school.  Martha's work is preparing and selling food, like fried chicken, hamburgers, fried rice, chicken stew etc.  She runs her business in front of her house.  Each day, at dusk, she takes out her utensils, like tables, chairs, plates, spoons, etc.  She started her business because she needed a way to support her children's education and also to have a job to help with the household expenses.  Martha and her husband do the shopping together very early every morning.  Her oldest son helps her to prepare the different food.  She thinks that her business is profitable because of the good flavor of her dishes.  She has more customers every day and her earnings reach 50% of what she invests.  Prior to starting her business, Martha had financial problems because she didn't have a steady job, which is why she decided to start her own business.  In the future, she hopes to build a restaurant in her home, to make a better living.  She is requesting a loan of 1,000 mil soles (USD $400), which she will use to purchase ingredients like rice, eggs, condiments, bread, potatoes, etc. to prepare different plates of food.  Martha is very happy to have financial backing for her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1245375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, eggs, condiments, bread and potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-27T22:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-27T22:10:10Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":152.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":165.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":171.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":174.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":183.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.12,"local_amount":152.81,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":158.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188950},{"amount":60.73,"local_amount":151.81,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":157.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572847},{"amount":66.21,"local_amount":165.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":171.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122506},{"amount":68.67,"local_amount":171.69,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":177.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868330},{"amount":69.88,"local_amount":174.7,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":180.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577157},{"amount":73.39,"local_amount":183.47,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":190.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529402}],"funded_date":"2012-11-29T15:12:19Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":501868,"name":"Fa\u00efda Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les quatre membres du groupe FA\u00cfDA sont des femmes mari\u00e9es avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 37 ans, et en moyenne 3 enfants.

Despite her age of 52, she is full of life and proud to see her children now productive, independent adults who are forging good futures.  She owns a house built of substantial materials that she managed to build little by little.  Up until a short time ago, she worked in agriculture and animal husbandry but then looked for a business alternative like the sale of fish and vegetables at wholesale.  She\u2019s been doing this for a year and she\u2019s met new customers who are now her friends.  She heads out by herself with help from transportation providers who cover her routes taking her products preferably on the weekend.\r\n\r\nShe likes her activity very much because she must rise at dawn often and cover several points in her location contacting many people who value her work very much and establish good friendships with her; it must be clear, however, that she ends her day exhausted after returning home where she stores her goods.\r\n\r\nAt the exact first year anniversary of her business, she plans to buy merchandise to supply more annexes and needs more capital to do so since one of her goals it to reach all the points in her location.

She is respected and known as a fair and purposeful woman. She is 41 years old. She is divorced and is raising three children. In her personal life she is not lucky, as her husband left her with three children, and does not even provide them with the necessary resources for living. It is difficult for Zulfiya to provide for the children. However her parents help her, even if she does not want help. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve their living conditions, Zulfiya decided to set up her own business for the good of the family. With this aim she attended the course \"Bring It On\", organized by the Association of Business Women and she received a certificate. Now she may organize her business and become successful in this area. \r\n\r\nZulfiya would like to set up a business of growing agricultural crops, as she has experience in this type of business. From the income received she plans to provide her children with a good education and proper food. She requests a loan in the amount of 1,500 somoni for the purchase of mineral fertilizers and seeds, in order to set up the new business.

I started buying finished carvings, and in the evenings I learned to carve these beautiful items. My background in auto mechanics became very useful at this point because of my knowledge in cutting and designing of metals, as well as the skill I learned from my father who was a blacksmith.

She decided to lead an independent life with only her four children by her side, two of whom are young and still require her support and attention. She is the owner of a wooden house where she performs her duties as a mother. \r\n\r\nMaria produces agricultural products, among which is her preferred product, organic cacao, because it is a fruit in high demand in her region and it is easily grown in the area considering everything required. She carries out her agricultural activities on parcels of land she acquired with the help of her ex-partner 20 years ago. In order to obtain the quality of fruits that she wants, she must rely on additional help from laborers on site to carry out distinct complicated tasks. \r\n\r\nShe likes to work in the fields because it reminds her of times when she was a child together with her parents doing the same activities. However, by the time the cacao is ready there is a certain decrease in the final price offered by stockpilers. She is hoping to improve the situation for the next season.\r\n\r\nFinding herself at the start of the season whose harvest is projected for next year, she needs to have capital in order to continue to expand her plantations and to replace old cacao trees respectively.

They decided to start together from a young age, driven by love and the special trust between them.  As a fruit of their relationship they have a precious little girl named Asulda, age 1, to whom they direct their future goals.  They live temporarily in an adobe house, which they rent.\r\n\r\nFor two years she has made a living with Ren\u00e1n in agricultural work on some plots of land her parents gave her because they're a young couple with a great desire to improve themselves.  Their main crop is organic cacao because it's very stable in the area.  As in any beginning they had certain problems trying to achieve financial stability for the future family.\r\n\r\nWhat's encouraging is that, in spite of starting out with little capital, they've managed to cover all the basic family expenses, considering that they already have the responsibility of their little girl.  Nevertheless, working together has been a great tool for unity because understanding and family harmony prevail in their family environment.\r\n\r\nA little while ago she received a proposal from a merchant in the area who offered to rent her his store for a long time because he plans to take a trip for a variety of reasons.  She considers it a good opportunity and plans to take it.

She lives at her husband's place with her children in a nuclear family located in Wayerma, in Sikasso City. After several unsuccessful businesses, Ms. Maminata was introduced to this revenue-generating business over five years ago. She enjoys a great reputation locally buying and selling condiments at the house and at the Lafiabougou market, where she has a spot. \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying her ever-growing customer base, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on her first individual loan. This loan will be used to purchase: 5 pails of peanut butter, 3 boxes of Magie [bouillon cubes], 2 boxes of tomato paste, 2 sacks of onions, and 5 boxes of mustard, in Sikasso. \r\n\r\nAccepting cash or credit, Ms. Maminata makes her sales to customers from all walks of life. With this loan, she envisions making a monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used to help cover family expenses and pay the loan interest. And the rest will be invested in her business.

After having lost her husband, Mrs. Mariam started selling food condiments. She sells at the M\u00e9dine market, where she has a store, and where she is heavily sought after by her clientele for the quality of her products. In order to satisfy her growing clientele, she decided to join microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso about two years ago. She has already benefited from three loans, which have all been successfully repaid. In the goal of continuing to improve her business, she is seeking a fourth loan, which will allow her to increase her business funds to be able to buy 15 sacks of fresh tomatoes, 15 sacks of onions, different grains, and a stock of condiments. Her products are bought on the spot by farmers coming from neighboring villages and brought back to sell in the weekly markets in Yorosso and Kouri near the Mali-Burkina Faso border, for retail and wholesale for credit on fair days to a clientele composed essentially of fairground people. She envisions earning with this loan a monthly profit of 110,000 FCFA, which will be used to contribute to family expenses, pay interest on her loan, and reinvest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1245233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Ulaanbaatar, the capital. His house is located in the boundary area of the city with no water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. Erdenekhuyag\u2018s family consists of four people: himself, his wife and two children who are students. In 2008 they bought the land and built a 60-square-meter wooden house. \r\nSince 2003, Erdenekhuyag has had a micro bus with 14 seats and with his wife runs a transportation business between Ulaanbaatar and a province 800 km away. He runs three times minimum in a month to Zavkhan province. \r\nAs his children grow the house is feeling smaller. Therefore Erdenekhuyag is planning to expand his house by building a new floor with wood and laying bricks on the outer side of the walls in order to stop the heat loss through the walls. By doing this Erdenekhuyag\u2019s family can improve their living condition and will have a spacious house that will serve them the rest of their life.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeonora hopes to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1245487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960461},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4093.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095212},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5116.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484361},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4093.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036873}],"funded_date":"2012-11-28T09:22:41Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Johnston","image":142987}},{"id":502013,"name":"Jeshty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeshty is a 32 year old married woman and a mother of two young children ages eight and four.

She is also a teacher at a local school in the same town. Judith, pictured at her sukuma wiki (vegetable) farm, has always been passionate about farming and has no regrets at all in investing in this type of business.\r\n\r\nShe has made her first loan request of 41,600 KES (Kenyan shillings) through Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow. This loan will enable her to acquire a quality dairy cow that will produce enough milk for domestic consumption and sale. The proceeds from the sale of milk will help improve the livelihood of her family. She is planning to expand her dairy farm by acquiring at least six quality dairy cows able to produce at least 20 litres of milk daily. Her primary challenge has been poor market prices for her farm

Thanks to the previous loan Olga was able to buy used arches for the greenhouse and complete the building of two large greenhouses as well as significantly increase revenue from the garden and buy a tractor for cultivation of land. Moreover the family could afford to buy an inexpensive vehicle of local make.\r\n\r\nThis time Olga needs a loan in the amount of 20,000 hryvnia to install heating in the greenhouse: to buy a boiler for 10,000 hryvnia and hoses for installation costing 10,000 hryvnia. This will give her the opportunity to sell early vegetables at a higher price. At this time one of the major current issues for Olga is the long distance from the road and the market which makes it difficult to export products. Sometimes she has to ask some of the neighbors to transport the produce. Over time Olga hopes to purchase a vehicle for business to solve this urgent

The only source of income for Marina is her small monthly salary, working as a servant-maid in a family. \r\n\r\nAs her income is not enough for everyday expenses and food, Marina decided to start a new business. She has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for the business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was always rejected, due to lack of experience in a new business and her low income. Experience is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with easier conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Marina will purchase used clothing and sell it from her house among her neighbors. She will begin her entrepreneurial activity with a wide assortment of merchandise and high sales volume. This will increase her income. She wants to develop her business further and reinvest the increased income in her business. The new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve her living conditions.

Kenya Region. She has been farming for the last twenty years, producing maize, beans and horticultural crops which she sells locally. She also operates a retail shop in the same town. She says that farming has always been her hobby and this has made it more successful than she ever imagined. She, like any other farmer, faces the challenges of lack of enough water for her crops and lack of enough capital for expansion.\r\n\r\nShe has made her first loan request through Juhudi Kilimo for a loan of 40,000 KES in order to purchase irrigation equipment, including water pipes and a pump. This loan will enable her install irrigation equipment at her farm which she can use during the dry season. She says that this will ensure constant production throughout all seasons. The increased production will increase her income and improve her living standards.\r\n\r\nRosemary would like to acquire a pick-up truck in the near future to help transport her produce to the market

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profits, which will help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nNarlina hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmily operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also has a thrift store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Php (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmily hopes to expand her business and dreams to have their own house and lot through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1245665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":1867,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1908.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960464},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":4666,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4769.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095219},{"amount":93.34,"local_amount":3734,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3817.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484368},{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":3733,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3816.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036880}],"funded_date":"2012-11-28T20:41:31Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":502116,"name":"Amon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amon lives in rural western Uganda and is a farmer.

She is married to Onofreg and mother to her children. Together with her husband, Marilou manages her household while operating a variety store. She works hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5-PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Marilou buys supplies at wholesale prices and sells by the piece. Her regular customers are neighbors and local community members and she earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nMarilou is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory and help continue her business.

She sells her milk to the local market. She faces the challenges of diseases and high cost of dairy feeds, which affect her production.\r\n\r\nShe has made a loan request of 52,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) through Juhudi Kilimo in order to purchase and insure a dairy cow. This loan will enable her acquire a quality dairy cow that will produce enough milk for domestic consumption and sale. The proceeds from the sale of milk will help her pay school fees for her children and improve the livelihood of her family. \r\n\r\nShe plans to increase her milk production by acquiring hybrid dairy

is 47 years old. He lives in Martvili District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and grandchild. The family runs a small dairy farm of two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. The cheese is sold at the local open market. \r\n\r\nBesides dairy farming, Besik serves the local people as a taxi driver with his own car. His wife is involved in a flower-trading business. She purchases flowers locally and sells them in the nearby district for a higher price. \r\n\r\nAll of the family members work hard, but the income is not enough for covering the everyday expenses. So, Besik decided to start up a new business. He has requested loans from his local financial institutions several times without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.\r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country, rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Besik will build a greenhouse. He will purchase building materials and construct it. Besik will plant different kinds of flowers, which will be sold by his wife at a good price. This will increase his income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. Besik awaits your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1245737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to build a greenhouse to plant flowers that will be sold by his wife.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Nagvazao","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Besik ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":213.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":204.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":209.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":224.27},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":220.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":228.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":231.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":239.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":243.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":249.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":257.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":261.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":269.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":274.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":281.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":290.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":303.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.57},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.51,"local_amount":213.87,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":214.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331182064},{"amount":124.04,"local_amount":204.83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":205.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565942},{"amount":127.09,"local_amount":209.88,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":210.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115515},{"amount":135.81,"local_amount":224.27,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:58:48Z","rounded_local_amount":225.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860995},{"amount":133.57,"local_amount":220.57,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":221.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569800},{"amount":2074.98,"local_amount":3426.58,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3439.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968438}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T18:54:34Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":502180,"name":"Flavia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flavia's group is comprised of 2 hard-working women.

She is single and has one child who is currently in school. For the past three years, she has been working hard to manage her restaurant, where she earns a living by selling cooked food. To help expand her business, she is requesting a loan for 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. She will use the loan to buy more food, including plantain, rice and beans as well as chairs and some tables. She hopes that these items will help her earn a larger income, which will allow her to pay for her child's education. Her goal for the future is to expand her business into a big hotel. Jackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to making microfinance loans, the program provides a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos.

","en":"Rosa, 57, went to elementary school, and then married young. She recently separated from her husband, which has been a very difficult situation for her, but she decided to keep moving forward with more determination and strength of will. She lives in the canton of Pastaza, in the provine of the same name, which is part of the Amazonian region of Ecuador. The capital of the canton is the city of Puyo, which is located in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, just west of the province of Pastaza at 924 metres above sea level. Demographically it\u2019s a small area, but it has a variety of sites that attract national and international tourists, especially ecological endeavours and extreme sports.\r\nIt\u2019s a city that grows economically every day because of commerce, livestock breeding, agriculture and tourism; for this reason, financial and commercial businesses have opened branches here to take advantage of the economic activity maintining the city. Competition between companies is strong, but each has promoted its own added value to gain preference with clients. \r\nAfter her separation, Rosa found herself insecure about her future; there in Pastaza she felt that she had no alternatives because of her advanced years. However, those limitations didn\u2019t last long when she put into practise the knowledge she gained from her parents, concering the undertaking of a business and selling spices.\r\nAfter the sun comes out, Rosa opens the doors to her business, which is located in a small space in the local market. She started her business 10 years ago with the help and support of her daughter. Rosa has become a determined woman and thinks one can always accomplish more and it\u2019s never too late to dream. With the 10 hours that she invests in her work every day, she knows her business can grow in some way. That\u2019s why she decided to request a loan to buy spices and herbs in order to increase her sales. \u201cFundaci\u00f3n Alternativa\u201d communal bank has offered Rosa the training and advice to correctly administrate her tangible and intangible resources. Rosa is grateful to the Kiva lenders for contributing their grain of sand to the accomplishment of her dream of being a successful small business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1245895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy spices and ingredients to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pastaza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa  Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":626.88,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":75.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":76.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.74,"local_amount":73.05,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":75.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126217},{"amount":78.39,"local_amount":75.6,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":78.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516823},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":76.71,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":79.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068679},{"amount":81.29,"local_amount":78.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":81.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494945},{"amount":81.9,"local_amount":78.98,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":81.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524874},{"amount":83.21,"local_amount":80.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133178},{"amount":84.3,"local_amount":81.31,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313722},{"amount":85.63,"local_amount":82.58,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565327}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T21:19:25Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":502195,"name":"Madona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madona is 36 years old, married and lives in Batumi city with her husband and two children (12 and 15 years old).

She also rents out a room in her house to earn additional monthly income. Madona requested a loan from local financial institutions for the business expansion, but without success. Her loan request was rejected because of low income and insufficient experience in her business.\r\nHer loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The program provides start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor. They do not have access to traditional credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nMadona requested a loan to equip the store with an additional refrigerator. She will keep perishable products there and will be able to sell meat which is in high demand. The existing refrigerators are inadequate to store all the inventory.

He has been running the business during five years and the project was profitable, but now it needs financial support. Several times, he has asked for loans from local financial institutions to develop his business with no success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of his low income.\r\nJansughi\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit, with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Jansughi will cover the costs of purchasing needed stock of books that customers often request. He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Jansughi will work hard, and he will be able to improve the living conditions for his family. With this loan, the family will generate enough income to access regular available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event it is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1245807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase books for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Zestaponi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jansughi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":82.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":96.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":101.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":107.12},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":110.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":119.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.15,"local_amount":82.15,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":82.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565944},{"amount":96.46,"local_amount":96.46,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115517},{"amount":101.85,"local_amount":101.85,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":101.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860997},{"amount":101.68,"local_amount":101.68,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569801},{"amount":105.13,"local_amount":105.13,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":105.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968439},{"amount":107.12,"local_amount":107.12,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":107.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748862},{"amount":110.54,"local_amount":110.54,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":110.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612776},{"amount":595.07,"local_amount":595.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":595.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856520}],"funded_date":"2012-12-03T00:27:31Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T14:44:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":502215,"name":"Cissy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cissy is 23 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda.

Despite that, she considers her production to be very profitable because she is located in a zone where the cacao is of a unique quality.\r\n\r\nShe wants to begin the cacao campaign in a different way.  She plans to replace the old trees and use the leftover stems to graft, so she needs to buy new plants, fertilizer, tools and hire trained people in order to get an optimal result and get the maximum benefit from her parcels.

The one thing that completes her happiness is her little Antony, 13. Together they form a family where love and work are their reasons for being.\r\n\r\nThanks to all their years of work and effort they have managed to finish building a home made from good quality materials. She farms the parcels of land that she and Manuel have acquired. For 20 years they have been managing to establish cacao plantings, which over time have achieved an enviable quality.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time she has had various life experiences, both good and bad, but always at the side of her partner. He in turn is her faithful work companion, not to forget the day laborers that she hires to help with the necessary work.\r\n\r\nIn beginning next year's cacao season, she has carried out the reconditioning of a part of her land to render it more productive, and ready for the planting of the seedlings or young cacao, for which she must acquire these plants and also buy sacks of organic fertilizer. \r\n\r\nAnother of the her requirements for optimizing her output is to bring in day laborers for the planting of temporary shade trees which are very necessary so that the sun doesn't directly affect the plantings.\r\n\r\nThis is how she carries on with quite a bit of motivation, since one of her long-term objectives is to acquire a home in the region's capital. This is so that  in the future she can send her son to a fine university for his post-secondary studies \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP. She is very happy and promises to be punctual in making her installment payments. She sees her fellow communal bank members as a good team; responsible and supportive, and this makes her feel very confident.\r\n\r\nWith the 1000 nuevos soles she has been granted, she will buy cacao seedlings, as well as sacks of organic fertilizer. The remaining money will help pay for the day laborers for the tree-planting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1245901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

He lives in Gori District with his wife and mother. George requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the monthly pension of George\u2019s mother. It makes a total of 150 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit George will rent space and start an auto repair business. George plans to purchase essential auto repair installations such as a tire changer and trim controller in order to respond rapidly to his clients' problems.

Both lead a harmonious coexistence and have, as the fruit of their love, their son Edwin, who is 6 years old. She has managed and worked together with her partner in their carpentry business for the last four years. The business started because the young couple was looking for a fixed income to support the family, because then Edwin was only working as a helper in other workshops. They decided later to become independent thanks to loans from MFP and their savings thereafter. \r\n\r\nThey consider their work an activity of family union. Rosmeri helps with the minor activities in the pair while Edwin is in charge of the main, required work. Working together in this way they have succeeded in converting their business in to their primary family income. However, sometimes delays in the arrival of their wooden blocks causes them to have to cancel certain orders. \r\n\r\nIn order to continue completing orders, they wish to continue investing in the purchase of blocks of wood for the fabrication of tables, chairs, beds, and more.

soltera y tiene un hijo de 3 a\u00f1os, para ella ha sido muy dif\u00edcil educar sola a su hijo, pero \u00e9l se ha convertido en la inspiraci\u00f3n de cada d\u00eda para salir adelante en su trabajo. Viven en Pastaza, un cant\u00f3n ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta ciudad. En cada negocio se encuentra personas que no se han dado por vencidas frente a la falta de empleo sino que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio para llevar una vida digna y hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os.\nMaricela emprendi\u00f3 con la venta de frutas y verduras de forma ambulante cuando qued\u00f3 embarazada, es decir hace alrededor de 4 a\u00f1os. La posibilidad de continuar estudiando se hab\u00eda desvanecido, primero por los escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos y despu\u00e9s por la llegada de su hijo. Sin embargo a pesar de los obst\u00e1culos ha salido adelante con su vida. Trabaja diez horas cada d\u00eda, su trabajo consiste en clasificar, limpiar y vender las frutas y verduras que ofrece, en sus salidas se ubica en lugares estrat\u00e9gicos de barrios en donde las amas de casa realizan sus compras. Aprendi\u00f3 este negocio de sus padres y ahora lo administra muy  bien. En esta temporada aparecen en el mercado frutas tropicales como ciruela y mango que son muy demandadas por los clientes. Es por eso que Maricela requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para abastecer su negocio con una cantidad de estas frutas y as\u00ed recaudar m\u00e1s ingresos para ofrecer a su hijo un estilo de vida digno y adem\u00e1s mantener un ahorro que en el futuro pueda invertirlo en la educaci\u00f3n de su hijo y as\u00ed poder darle la profesi\u00f3n que ella no tuvo la oportunidad de conseguir. Maricela agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes con agilidad y confianza le otorgaron el cr\u00e9dito y adem\u00e1s la asesor\u00eda para llevar una buena administraci\u00f3n y presentaci\u00f3n de su negocio. ","en":"Maricela is a 20-year-old young woman.  She finished secondary school.  She's single and has a child, age 3.  It has been very hard for her to raise her child alone, but he has become an inspiration every day for her to get ahead in her job.\r\n\r\nThey live in Pastaza, a canton located in the province of the same name, in the Amazon region of the Republic of Ecuador.  The canton seat is the city of Puyo, located in the middle of the Amazon jungle in the west of Pastaza Province at 924 meters above sea level.  Demographically it's small, but there's a wide variety of sites preferred by Ecuadorian and international tourists, especially for ecological and extreme sports activities.\r\n\r\nIt's a city that grows economically every day because of commerce, livestock, agriculture, and tourism.  For this reason branches of banks and businesses have been established to make the most of the economic activity here.  In every business there are people who, faced with the lack of jobs, have not given up but rather have undertaken ideas for businesses to have a decent life and make their dreams come true.\r\n\r\nMaricela started selling fruits and vegetables on foot when she was pregnant, about four years ago.  The possibility of continuing to study had disappeared, first because of her scarce financial resources and then because of the arrival of her child.  Nevertheless, in spite of the obstacles, she has gotten ahead with her life.  She works ten hours every day.  Her job consists of sorting, cleaning, and selling fruits and vegetables.  When she goes out to sell she stays in strategic locations in neighborhoods where housewives shop.  She learned this business from her parents and now manages it very well.  \r\n\r\nIn this season, tropical fruits such as plums and mangos appear in the market and are in high demand among her customers.  This is why Maricela needs a loan to stock her business with a quantity of these fruits and earn more income to give her son decent lifestyle.  She  also wants to maintain savings she can use in the future for her son's education, to give him a profession, which she herself didn't have the opportunity to have.\r\n\r\nMaricela is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, which adroitly and trustingly gave her the loan and the counseling to manage and carry out her business well.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1245913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Rosalind is grateful for the help Kiva investors offer those of few resources -- and poor countries like Nicaragua -- so that they can have a dignified work environment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":953524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"invest in business capital and stock her business with flip-flops for men, children and women, and shoes made of fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalina Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.21,"local_amount":1251.93,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1278.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331972513},{"amount":53.08,"local_amount":1248.91,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1275.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339564199},{"amount":53.22,"local_amount":1252.21,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-21T08:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1279.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347758071},{"amount":56.84,"local_amount":1337.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1366.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356526917},{"amount":53.43,"local_amount":1257.29,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364568127},{"amount":53.45,"local_amount":1257.65,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373162748},{"amount":53.39,"local_amount":1256.17,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1283.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381968543},{"amount":48.38,"local_amount":1138.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1162.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390830356}],"funded_date":"2012-12-09T22:13:50Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:28:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":502304,"name":"Analou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Analou is 37 years old and the mother of two young children who lives in Talibon, Bohol.

She\u2019s been in this business two years and is doing very well.  \r\n\r\nBeing alone and caring for her son\u2019s wellbeing is what led her to start this activity and it\u2019s become profitable because of the large number of customers she has.  She\u2019s recommended for the good flavor and she also makes birthday cakes.  Prior to starting this activity, she used to sell groceries but didn\u2019t do too well because of the location of her store which is why she decided to change her line of work.  She hopes in future to have a locale of her own that has a suitable environment for comfortable customer service.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this will be her 3rd MFP loan and she is very grateful to the institution for letting her be part of this group that supports each other and also because she now has back-up capital for her business.  She will use the requested 1,200 to buy an electric oven to quicken production.  She will also stock up on flour, eggs and milk, among others.  This will make it possible for her to increase her income.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1246025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy an electric oven, flour, eggs and milk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":177.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":190.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":189.14},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":206},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":214.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":222.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.13,"local_amount":177.16,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":181.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188962},{"amount":75.24,"local_amount":190.1,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":194.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572859},{"amount":74.87,"local_amount":189.14,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":193.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868342},{"amount":89.69,"local_amount":226.58,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":232.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577169},{"amount":132.63,"local_amount":335.07,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":343.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529414},{"amount":3.91,"local_amount":9.87,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091923},{"amount":14.92,"local_amount":37.69,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-08T10:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":38.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778586},{"amount":13.61,"local_amount":34.39,"processed_date":"2014-07-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-02T12:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":35.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504306716}],"funded_date":"2012-11-30T05:12:37Z","paid_date":"2015-09-02T12:13:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":502363,"name":"Rosalia Ramona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosal\u00eda de 37 anos de edad, casada sin hijos, del departamento de le\u00f3n, lugar que esta ubicado en la zona de occidente del pa\u00eds.

She says that because they had no jobs, she and her husband set up their business.  \r\n\r\nAt first they sold paint for shoes, shoe polish and shoe laces and then the people themselves suggested they start to stock things like screwdrivers, screws and many other things so she says she saved up a little money and went to Mexico City to stock up because all sorts of hardware and things sold in hardware stores are sold there; she decided to make her business grow and says that she\u2019s now asking Vision Fund for a loan to improve her stand.  She wants to make it grow by buying some packages of hardware she saw and she wants to buy a tarpaulin because the one they have is deteriorated because of the weather.  She says that the loans she\u2019s asked the financial institution have improved her business and her family conditions and now her goal is to have a larger stand.\r\n\r\nThe other group members\u2019 names are Alicia, Olivia, Leonel, Priscila, Rosa Mar\u00eda, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe and Juana and they will invest in their various businesses like stocking up on seasonal fruit and vegetables to sell,

Dice que a ra\u00edz de que su marido falleci\u00f3 ella tuvo que hacerse cargo sola de sus hijos ya que en aquel tiempo los tres estudiaban, dice que ahorita dos de sus hijas trabajan en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico como empleadas domesticas y ellas son las que le ayudan a sacar adelante a su hijo el cual estudia la preparatoria  con muchos sacrificios. Ella desde hace mas de 4 a\u00f1os se dedica al cultivo de aguacate, ella dice \u201cmi esposo me dejo un negocio muy pesado en mantenimiento pero gracias a este puedo sacar adelante a mi hijo que estudia ya que yo no puede estudiar por falta de recursos me tengo que dedicar a la tierra que me dejo mi difunto esposo que gracias a los 3 cr\u00e9ditos que me han hecho lo he podido sacar adelante ya que lo descuide un poco cuando mi marido falleci\u00f3 pero ahorita est\u00e1n en buenas condiciones\u201d. Dice que est\u00e1 pidiendo el cr\u00e9dito para comprar abono org\u00e1nico, fertilizantes e insecticidas para que no le peguen las heladas fuertes y puedan aguantar los granizos que caen en la temporada de invierno. Dice que ahorita tiene aproximadamente 200 \u00e1rboles y espera seguir sembrando m\u00e1s ya que su terreno  esta grande casi son dos hect\u00e1reas y quiere cubrirlo de este tipo de fruto, pl\u00e1tica que cuando es temporada de cosechar va a la central de abastos a venderlos por kilos ya que le sale mejor venderlos as\u00ed y dice que las ultimas cosechas le han ido bien en la corta porque a sacado bastante. Su mayor anhelo es que su hijo el menor tenga una carrera para que no sufra trabajar en el campo y que sus hijas vuelvan a estudiar porque no le gusta que est\u00e9n tan lejos de ella, tambi\u00e9n quiere seguir comprando matas de aguacate para seguir cultivando y dejarle a sus hijos un negocio bueno.

She\u2019s 44-year-old and a widow.  She\u2019s a member of the \u201cLos Encinos Ganader\u00eda\u201d group.  She says they gave it this name because where they live oak trees are common and the \u2018ganader\u00eda\u2019 part is because most of the members work raising pigs, cattle and sheep.  She says that at her husband\u2019s death, she\u2019s had to take on her children\u2019s care all by herself.  Back then, the three of them were students but now two of her daughters work in Mexico City as domestic employees and they help her support her son who is attending high-school with much sacrifice.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been growing avocadoes for more than four years.  She says: \u201cMy husband left me a business that requires much hard work to care for but thanks to it I\u2019m able to move my son, who is studying, forward since I was unable to study due to the lack of resources.  I have to devote myself to the land my late husband left me and thanks to the three loans I\u2019ve gotten I\u2019ve been able to move it forward even though I did neglect it somewhat when my husband died but now it\u2019s in good condition.\u201d  She says she\u2019s asking for this loan to buy organic manure, fertilizer and insecticide to protect against the chilling frosts and hail storms that are common in winter.  \r\n\r\nShe says that she now has about 200 trees and hopes to continue planting more since her field is large; it\u2019s almost two hectares and she wants to cover it entirely with this type of fruit.  She relates that when it\u2019s harvest time she heads to the wholesale food market to sell them by the kilo since it\u2019s more profitable to sell them that way.  She says the last few harvests have been good since her yields were quite large.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest hope is that her youngest son will have a career so he will not have to suffer working in the fields and that her daughters can restart their schooling because she does not like their being so far from her.  She also wants to continue to buy avocado plants to continue growing them and leave a good business for her children.\r\n\r\nThe other group members\u2019 names are Eulalia, Mar\u00eda del Carmen, Mar\u00eda Luisa, Mar\u00eda, Alicia, Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica, Lorena, Rosario and Sandra and they will use their loans to buy fertilizer, organic manure for avocado farming, will buy feed and vaccines for pigs, fertilizer and manure for tomato crops and will buy merchandise to stock a grocery

Ella es parte del grupo Invierno y dice que le pusieron ese nombre al grupo porque cuando tiene m\u00e1s actividad econ\u00f3mica su pueblo es en la temporada de invierno ya que donde vive se encuentra el santuario de la mariposa monarca donde a\u00f1o con a\u00f1o arriban las grandiosas mariposas para dar un espect\u00e1culo sin igual y donde miles de turistas de todo el mundo van a admirar las bellezas de la naturaleza. Dice que a ella le llena de orgullo ser parte de un pueblo como este ya que se conoce gente de todo el mundo y pueden ver los turistas las artesan\u00edas que hacen los pueblos ind\u00edgenas de Michoac\u00e1n. Dice que casi todo el a\u00f1o ella se dedica a bordar servilletas, manteles, almohadones con lo representativo de su pueblo, es decir, las mariposas monarca y que las vende en poblaciones aleda\u00f1as a su comunidad y que ahorita est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de material porque a partir del 20 de noviembre de cada a\u00f1o se abre el santuario y empiezan a llegar los turistas y quiere surtir para vender afuera del santuario  como playeras, recuerdos como llaveros, lapiceros, cuadros de madera con fotograf\u00edas de las mariposas ya que tiene su puesto desde hace mas de 14 a\u00f1os. Ella tiene tres hijos y est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Daniel quien trabaja como jornalero. Comenta que cuando termina la temporada de mariposa que es a mediados de marzo es cuando empieza a vender en su tiendita de abarrotes que tiene en su casa. Su meta en su negocio es tratar de conseguir un puesto estable en el santuario para que cada a\u00f1o pueda vender sus artesan\u00edas y no tenga que pagar tanto impuesto que le cobran por poner su puesto de artesan\u00edas y recuerdos de la mariposa. Las otras cuatro integrantes del grupo se llaman Teresa, Imelda, Rosa y Adela ellas invertir\u00e1n sus cr\u00e9ditos que les otorgaran en la compra de insumos para elaborar pan de rancho, para la compra de art\u00edculos para surtir tienda de abarrotes, para la compra de insumos para elaborar antojitos mexicanos.\n\n\n","en":"Elizabeth, 30, comments: \u201cThe very day when I\u2019m getting my new loan is my birthday and I feel happy and joyful because I\u2019m starting a new year of life very encouraged because thanks to what I\u2019m going to be lent I will be able to stock my business.\u201d  She\u2019s part of the \u201cInvierno\u201d (Winter) group and she says they named it thus because winter is when her town has the most economic activity because they live in a zone where the monarch butterfly sanctuary is located and every year the magnificent butterflies arrive to produce an unequalled spectacle that draws thousands of tourists from all over the world that come to admire nature\u2019s beauty.  \r\n\r\nShe says that it fills her with pride to be part of a town like this one that people from all over the world know about and tourists from all over the world can admire the crafts the indigenous peoples of Michoac\u00e1n make.  She says that she spends most of the year embroidering napkins, tablecloths and cushions with scenes representative of her town, that is, monarch butterflies that she sells in towns adjacent to her community.  She\u2019s now asking for a loan to buy supplies because starting on November 20th each year the sanctuary opens and tourists start arriving and she wants to be stocked up to sell outside the sanctuary.  She sells t-shirts, keepsakes like key rings, pencils, wood picture frames with photos of the butterflies, etc.  She\u2019s had her stand for more than 14 years.\r\n\r\nShe has three children and is married to Daniel who works as a day laborer.  She comments that when the butterfly season ends in mid-March she works selling in her little, home-based grocery store.  Her business goal is to try to get a stationary stand in the sanctuary so that she can sell her crafts each year and not have to pay the high taxes she\u2019s charged to set up her crafts and butterfly keepsake stand.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Teresa, Imelda, Rosa and Adela.  They will invest the loans they are granted into buying ingredients to make rustic bread, to buy grocery store stock merchandise and to buy ingredients to make Mexican fast-food snacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":1241440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy crafts and embroidery supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-29T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-29T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":3550,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":519.46,"local_amount":6731,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6776.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068163},{"amount":257.65,"local_amount":3338.62,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3360.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284901},{"amount":543.55,"local_amount":7043.24,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":7090.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199188},{"amount":288.06,"local_amount":3732.62,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3757.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595985},{"amount":462.1,"local_amount":5987.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6027.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663427},{"amount":205.78,"local_amount":2666.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2684.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840210},{"amount":1273.4,"local_amount":16500.28,"processed_date":"2013-08-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":16610.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698721}],"funded_date":"2012-11-30T23:42:54Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:46:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":502378,"name":"Aves De Para\u00edso Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Florencio tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad y es originario de una comunidad llamada Valle Verde un lugar lleno de vegetaci\u00f3n y donde la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes se dedica al comercio, platica don Florencio que tiene menos de un a\u00f1o trabajando con VisionFund y que le ha ido muy bien en su negocio a trav\u00e9s de los cr\u00e9ditos que le han hecho y eso lo tiene muy contento porque puede sacar adelante a su familia.

Florencio has worked with VisionFund for less than a year and the loans have helped his business go very well, so he is very content because he can make headway for his family. He belongs to a group called \"Aves de Para\u00edso\" (\"Birds of Paradise\"), which gave itself this name because their meeting place has a thicket of flowers of the same name that aren't very common in the region and are very beautiful. Florencio makes a living making ice creams and sorbets, with flavors like strawberry, coconut, vanilla, lemon, chocolate, apple, cheese, and many others, but these are the ones most requested by his customers, who are mostly children and youths since he sells outside of a elementary and high school in his community. He says that he is requesting the loan to purchase supplies to make his sorbets, such as milk, food dyes, fruits, ice, rock salt, sugar, cones and napkins. He says that he gets up very early to make his sorbets because they need to be ready by the time the children leave school. First he grounds the fruit or adds vanilla to the milk. The trick is with the ice cream. He says that he puts ice and rock salt inside a big pot so it doesn't melt too quickly, and then he puts another metal canister inside with the ingredients and slowly churns it as the ice cream freezes. He says he does this every day so he can take his delicious and rich ice creams to the school. He says that he started this job because he could not find stable work and a friend told him how to make ice cream, so he decided to take up the work. He says, \"I enjoy what I do because I already have my customers, and I'm my own boss and have time to be with my family.\" He has four children who are in elementary and high school, and for this reason he works very hard to provide them with the best and so they don't lack anything in regards to their education.

Mar\u00eda educa a su  nieto que tiene 13 a\u00f1os debido a algunos problemas que la madre del chico tiene con su horario de trabajo. Viven en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad. Cada familia de este lugar se esfuerza y busca todas las alternativas para mejorar su calidad de vida, por lo que se puede hablar de un cant\u00f3n emprendedor.\nMar\u00eda estableci\u00f3 su taller de costura desde hace algunos a\u00f1os, aprendi\u00f3 con la experiencia y poco a poco fue mejorando, ahora es toda una experta e invierte entre 8 y 10 horas en la elaboraci\u00f3n de ropa para toda ocasi\u00f3n, seg\u00fan la demanda de sus clientes.

Mar\u00eda se ha unido con amigos que tambi\u00e9n tienen necesidad de engrandecer sus negocios como es el caso de Jofre quien se dedica a la crianza y venta de cerdos, como lo hace Julio quien aparte de cerdos, vende pescado, y a esta actividad tambi\u00e9n se dedica Cruz quien comercializa cerdos y pollos Mar\u00eda quien cria pollos para su posterior venta, Teresa, Mar\u00eda y Ver\u00f3nica quienes venden ropa por cat\u00e1logo, al igual que Sonia quien a pesar de una discapacidad f\u00edsica tambi\u00e9n vende bisuter\u00eda de forma ambulante, Patricio y Angela cada uno con su tienda de v\u00edveres. ","en":"Mar\u00eda is 62 years old. She grew up in a poor family, so she only managed to get through elementary school. She separated from her husband a number of years ago, which was something very painful in her life and represented an obstacle in pursuing her business. Mar\u00eda raises her 13-year-old grandson because of some problems the boy's mother has with her work schedule. They live in Quinind\u00e9, a hamlet in the province of Esmeraldas that provides a number of cities in Ecuador with bananas, cacao, coffee, palm and forest products, and the majority of the inhabitants make a living in commerce. That has become even more the case since the roads into town were expanded, allowing a lot of commercial movement, especially on the weekends when merchants of all kinds go out to offer their products at the area flea markets. Tourism is another important industry because the natural ecosystem offers a wide variety of places to see waterfalls, rivers and forests full of flowers and animals. Every family works hard and looks for new ways to improve their quality of life, so one could call this an enterprising place. Mar\u00eda started her seamstress shop a number of years ago. She learned from experience and little by little improved her craft, and now she is an expert and spends between eight and 10 hours a day making clothing for all occasions, according to the demands of her customers. She is requesting the loan to purchase distinct fabrics and in this way she can offer a wider variety of styles. She hopes this will increase her income, since her goal is to have a big seamstress shop making clothes to sell all over the country, and with that she will be able to pay for her grandson's education until he becomes a professional. Mar\u00eda has joined with friends who also need to expand their businesses, as is the case with Jofre, who makes a living raising and selling pigs. Juilo raises pigs and sells fish, while Cruz sells pigs and chickens. Another Mar\u00eda raises and sells chickens. Teresa, Ver\u00f3nica and another Mar\u00eda sell clothing via catalog, same as Sonia, who despite a physical disability also sells jewelry.

Jos\u00e9 has been doing this type of work for 35 years and now he has the help of his son, who works as his assistant and is also practicing the trade at an institute.  He says that his business is profitable because he only had to make an initial investment \u2013 the purchase of the necessary tools for repairing vehicles.  Prior to pursuing this profession full-time, Jos\u00e9 thought he would start a business of buying and selling timber.  However, he did not know anything about this trade, so he ended up getting swindled and losing all of his capital.  After that, he made the decision to return to his previous skillset of repairing vehicles since that is what he knows best.  In addition, he would have the opportunity to work at home and be with his family.  He hopes to improve his shop in the future by acquiring a lathe and a grinder.  \r\n<p>\r\nJos\u00e9 is requesting a loan of 2,500 PEN so that he can buy spare parts such as spark plugs, chains, bearings, and other items.

In particular, they have two milk cows, whose milk is used in dairy products. Tengizi\u2019s wife produces cheese and yogurt and sells it at a good price with milk. It is hardly enough income for food for a four-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \r\n\r\nTengiz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Tengiz will purchase a minibus. After purchasing a minibus, Tengiz plans to go to the capital city with his minibus and sell milk, yogurt and cheese there.

Prudence is 23 years old and lives in the town of Kamwenge in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is married and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Prudence has been working hard to manage her small business selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prudence has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes to resell and will help Prudence to generate greater profits and pay for her medical bills and her children. Prudence hopes that, in the future, she will be able to educate her children up to the university level and also buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nPrudence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

He is married and has 4 children who are all currently in school. For the past 20 years, Herbert has been working hard to manage his farming, which trades in milk products like ghee, milk and skins. \n\nTo help expand his business, Herbert has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to get more animals for the business and will help Herbert to generate greater profits, sell milk products and buy all the necessities for the family. Herbert hopes that in the future he will be able to have a bigger farm. \n\nHerbert is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Herbert who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1242411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Olivia is 22 years old and lives in the town of Hima in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past two years, Olivia has been working hard to manage her retail shop, in which she sells flour, sugar, soap, and cooking oil.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Olivia has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more commodities like soda, sugar, Splash brand juice, and cooking oil for resale. This will help Olivia to generate greater profits and pay for her medical bills and her child. Olivia hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. She makes sure that she works hard to see that she educates her child.\r\n\r\nOlivia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1240419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

In the past 12 years, Parsiano has been working hard to manage his bar and restaurant, which sells variety of different drinks such as lemonade and beer . \n\nTo help expand his business, Parsiano has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to obtain more stock of drinks such as lemonade for resale, and will help Parsiano to generate greater and increased profits to live a better life. Parsiano hopes that in the future he will be able to raise funds to make a bigger bar . \n\nParsiano is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

Georgia. She has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times in order to start up a family business, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected every time because of the family's low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is Inga's work as a local cook. She makes a total of 250 laris per month, which is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo's assessment, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nInga has requested a loan from Credo for a family business start-up. Her loan request was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-ups, offering favorable loan conditions to poor rural people who do not have access to credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d. Using the loan, Inga will set up a new business trading in clothing and bed-clothes. She plans to purchase clothing from wholesalers and resell it locally. This new business initiative will significantly improve the income and living conditions of the family.

For the past year, Jamiila has been working hard to manage her small food stall, which sells raw food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jamiila has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food such as matooke (steamed green bananas) and sweet potatoes for resale. It will help Jamiila to generate greater profits and take care of herself and buy basic needs for the family. Jamiila hopes that in the future she will be able to own a bigger business than what she has now. \r\n\r\nJamiila is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Allen is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. For the past two years, Allen has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells all types of flour, sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Allen has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Allen to generate greater profits, which will be used to buy food at home. Allen hopes that in the future she will be able to earn more, which will help take care of her family. \r\n\r\nAllen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1246258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

For the past three years, Nadia has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells all types of flour, sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Nadia has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap. This will help Nadia to generate greater profits and expand her business into a bigger shop and to buy more items for the shop, which will increase her capital. Nadia hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nNadia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1246260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her economic activity is a newly started business. In particular, a grocery store. \r\n\r\nEva requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for further developing her business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of lack of experience in her business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers.\r\n  \r\nHer loan request was approved within the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Eva will cover the costs of purchasing her stock of basic groceries for starting a grocery store. She plans to work hard and increase the turnover in her business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, her family will generate enough income to

He earns an income as a taxi driver and provides services to local people. George's income is not enough to provide food for a three-person family and, according to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. George has decided to start a new business to supplement his income but his loan requests have been rejected several times by local financial institutions. He lacks experience with new business start-ups and does not qualify under income requirements. \r\n\r\nGeorge is requesting a loan under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This loan program envisions providing start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to many credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

Her loan request was rejected because of her low income and insufficient experience in her business. \r\n\r\nHowever, her loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Her working capital, though, is tied up in accounts receivable. She is seeking her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy clothing, underwear, and casual shoes. She is certain this investment will be successful because she will be meeting the needs of her regular customers, who live in the neighborhood where she has operated her business for two years. \r\n\r\nAt age 20, she started selling a variety of merchandise to earn income, and the business funds her daily needs and her dreams for the future. There is a small display case in the doorway of her house to attract customers to buy her merchandise. Mostly, Leyne sells clothing and shoes that she buys in the coastal city of  Barranquilla, which is three hours from her native San Juan Nepomuceno, and in Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia.

lives in the town of Nakifuma in the Mukono region of Uganda. He is married and has one child. For the past 3 years, Denis has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells sugar, posho, flour, and other items. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Denis has requested a loan of 3000000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. He will use this loan to increase his inventory of sugar, all types of flour and salt. This increased inventory will help Denis generate greater profits and improve his standard of living. Denis hopes that in the future he will be able to start a mini-supermarket. \r\n\r\nDenis is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).
