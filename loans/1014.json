Reyna makes and sells fruit ice creams using fruits like aguaje, coconut, and camu camu among others. She also sells different flavored sodas and different types of beer. She runs her business from a part of her mother\u2019s house. She started this business because she did not have enough income to be able to cover her children\u2019s study expenses. Her mother helps her to buy the drinks, and her children help her to make the ice creams.\n\nShe comments that her business is profitable due to the fact that her city is very hot, meaning that every day she gets more and more customers and her sales increase. Before she started her business, she had money problems because she could not afford to pay for her children\u2019s studies, and this worried her a lot. But her family decided to support her financially so that she could start a small business. She hopes to keep the business going because it makes good profits and allows her to cover her expenses.\n\nThis will be her third loan from MFP, and she is very grateful to the institution for giving her the opportunity to be a part of such a supportive group. This motivates her to continue making her repayments on time.\n\nWith the requested amount of 500 soles, she will buy fruits like aguaje, camu camu, coconut etc. to make more ice creams, and she will also buy sodas at wholesale so that she can increase her profits.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1246020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruits like aguaje, camu camu and coconut, and sodas for her ice cream business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-29T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-29T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":73.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":79.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":78.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":89.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":92.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":73.85,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":76.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188961},{"amount":31.7,"local_amount":79.24,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572858},{"amount":46.62,"local_amount":116.56,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":120.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868341},{"amount":19.26,"local_amount":48.16,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":49.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577168},{"amount":72.88,"local_amount":182.19,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":188.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529413}],"funded_date":"2012-11-29T20:17:04Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geraldine Pugh","image":null}},{"id":502567,"name":"Patricio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Patricio es un joven artesano ibarre\u00f1o que vive con su esposa y sus dos hijos \u00e9l se definen como una persona triunfadora, humilde, Patricio comenta que con fe y trabajo todo le va a salir muy bien y construir\u00e1 el camino para lograr sus metas.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito que el Sr. Patricio solicito a Fodemi se lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de materiales como hierro, \u00e1ngulos de metal, varilla y acero para la fabricaci\u00f3n de cocinas industriales ya que su trabajo est\u00e1 siendo muy reconocido en su ciudad y cada vez es m\u00e1s solicitado.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o que Don Patricio tiene es tener un gran taller de mec\u00e1nica industrial donde pueda fabricar todo tipo de artefactos en metal, y generar empleo para los j\u00f3venes que quieran aprender esta profesi\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Patricio is a young artisan from Ibarra who lives with his wife and his two children.

She has worked with VisionFund for four years although before she was part of a group called Barandillas. She decided to leave and ask for an individual loan with which she is very excited since she has faith in that her business will grow because of the new loan. For more than 21 years, she has had a couture shop in her home. She says that it all began because in high school she would go to the cutting and sewing workshop, and when she left high school creating clothing caught her attention. Therefore, she decided to enroll in a special school to perfect her techniques for the production of clothing. She says that she makes blouses, suits, pants, skirts, trousers, sheets, bedspreads, pajamas, etc. In the season in which the children and youths begin school, she goes to the schools to sell uniforms, and sometimes that same school will ask her to make daily and full-dress uniforms. Also, she makes suits for dances, costumes, fifteenth-birthday dresses, wedding dresses, and evening gowns.\r\n\r\nShe says that the loan that she is requesting is to buy material like cloth of different textures and colors, thread, zippers, buttons, needles, and many more things needed to make her clothing. She is very happy because she says that thanks to her new loan her business will improve a lot. Apart from this, she wants to buy a variety of cloths and materials because she wants to make bathroom, living room, and dining room sets, like Christmas table cloths since these are sold at a good price.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she will go to Mexico City and de Toluca where she will buy her material since one of her siblings will take her there to place the orders that afterwards they will bring to her house since she will buy wholesale. \r\n\r\nShe is the single mother of one daughter, and she says that she is making her want very much to come out ahead because she wants to improve her quality of life and to save money for her studies when she is older. She says that her recommendation letter is from the same people who recommend her to others since her products are very pretty and delicately made.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1245988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy material such as cloth of different textures and colors, thread, zippers, buttons, needles, and many more things needed to make her clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-29T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-29T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2729.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2820.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2965.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3226.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3285.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3480.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3635.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3836.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4021.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":211.58,"local_amount":2730,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2744,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068168},{"amount":218.56,"local_amount":2820.09,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2834.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284906},{"amount":229.85,"local_amount":2965.79,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2981,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199193},{"amount":250.27,"local_amount":3229.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3245.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595990},{"amount":254.66,"local_amount":3285.88,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3302.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663429},{"amount":269.75,"local_amount":3480.59,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3498.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840074},{"amount":578.68,"local_amount":7467.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7505.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698415},{"amount":311.65,"local_amount":4021.31,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4041.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944765}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T18:49:37Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T19:05:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":502513,"name":"Mildred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mildred, 50, lives in the town of Lugazi in the Mukono region of Uganda.

The only source of income for the family is the agricultural business, which is a plot of land where maize, laurel leaves, and citrus are grown.  In addition, the family runs a small dairy farm of 3 milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products.  The monthly income of the family is hardly enough to feed three people.  \r\n\r\nAccording to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category.  Maka requested a loan from Credo to start a dairy farm.  Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit due to low income (which labels them as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d).\r\nWith the requested loan, Maka will purchase a car which will be used to take the cheese to nearby villages for sale.  This will significantly decrease their transportation costs and allow additional savings for home renovation.

Cows are never raised for their meat but are used for their milk. Curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made from dairy cows. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about $0.50 USD. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung used in home construction, as fuel for fires and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

The house is situated in the small village of Guaraguaos Alto in Tambogrande District.  The area where Elsa lives is rural, but she does have electricity.  Elsa's business involves selling beer from her own home, where she prefers to serve her customers on Saturdays and Sundays. \n\nShe has built up a stable customer base in the area and has more than 5 years' experience in the business.  Her husband is a farmer who has his own parcel of land, on which he grows mangoes and lemons.

","en":"Leyla, 47, lives in the city of Cartagena de Indias with her spouse and three children whose ages range from 5 to 21 years.  She has a beauty shop there where she offers image enhancing services to all the surrounding families.  Her business started when she took an evening barber course at the age of 16 while working days because the teacher hired her when she saw her enthusiasm and capacity for applying the skills she was learning.  She gained vast experience this way and sometime later capitalized her business and has it to this day.  \r\n\r\nShe started out buying her work tools with her own income and continued taking refresher beauty courses and gradually expanded her growth possibilities; she purchased furnishings to organize her sales point.  Her drive for advancement led to her opening an academy and she taught courses.  Later on she became still better-known and she got a job that required her to travel frequently so she changed her business for a good job.  Five years after that, though, she returned to her original idea of having her own business.  She\u2019s done very well with this one and she simultaneously generates income by selling merchandise, especially those associated with beauty.  She\u2019s a beauty consultant and sells cosmetics and hair products at the same time and this is what her customers like best.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy hair treatments and cosmetics as well as a display case to keep her inventory well-organized.  Her Kiva loan\u2019s success rests on her vast experience and her managing to lower costs by being able to pay cash for larger amounts which is precisely what Leyla is

Without access to this student loan, she would need to focus less on her studies and direct her attention towards finding someone to help pay her tuition or risk having to drop out of school. For Silvia, a degree is an opportunity to earn a professional position and a professional paycheck. Putting school on hold would prolong her current financial situation, something she desperately wants to change. \n\nWithout the loan, Silvia thinks that she would need to ask her parents or other family members but worries that this may not be possible because her father is the only income generator in their family. He works as a carpenter while her mother tends to the house and family. Both her parents were only able to complete their primary education before they needed to enter the workforce. This loan will help Silvia to focus on finishing her law degree and become the professional that she aspires to be.\n\nSilvia has two brothers and one sister, but she will be the first student in her family to earn her college degree. She hopes to be an example for her siblings. With multiple college-educated people in the family, Silvia feels hopefully that together her siblings can change her family\u2019s status and provide a comfortable life for each other. She currently earns $350 per year, but she hopes to earn over $6,000 annually after she graduates.

He is currently enrolled in a degree program at the San Fransisco Xavier University but with his currently financial status he is unable to purchase the materials he needs, which is crippling his performance in school. Juan shares with us that without a computer it is difficult to learn and practice the practical component of his degree and it is inconvenient and even challenging to complete his thesis without consistent access to a computer and the internet. Much of engineering is computer based and without one, he feels that he is falling behind. \n\nAlthough Juan is the youngest of two, his household supports eight people in total. While both his parents are college educated, their family finances are very tight. With the aid of a student loan Juan plans to buy a laptop and the books and materials that will help him succeed. He chose commercial engineering because the field interested him and because he perceived a need for it in the job market. He hopes to be able to use his salary to help his family\u2019s finances.\n\nIn addition to his classes and study sessions, Juan holds a part time job. Currently he makes around $8,600 a year but with a degree in engineering he hopes to be able to double his salary, maybe even more. The prospect of a secure salary and in turn, a secure future for himself and his family is worth the sacrifice and extra work now. With the security of loan, Juan can be confident that he can afford his full education and be able to help move his life and his family forward.\n\nThis loan is administered by Vittana's partner Banco

Actualmente est\u00e1 divorciada y vive con su hija menor Diana en el sector sur de la Capital de los ecuatorianos; en Quito, espec\u00edficamente en Chillogallo. Hasta hace pocos el sector sur de la ciudad de Quito, no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles. \nSandra desde hace 12 a\u00f1os estableci\u00f3 un negocio de venta de frutas y verduras, uno de los obst\u00e1culos m\u00e1s grandes que ha tenido y que significaron un monto de dinero significativo, fue cuando detectaron a su hija mayor un c\u00e1ncer el cual fue tratado y ahora ella se encuentra estable con su salud. Sandra aprendi\u00f3 esta actividad con su t\u00eda que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 desde muy ni\u00f1a sobre los proveedores, las cuentas, etc. Sandra lo desarroll\u00f3 por sus hermanos para sacarlos adelante y luego por sus hijos. Es un trabajo muy duro pues requiere de esfuerzo f\u00edsico para cargar las cajas de frutas y luego clasificarlas, y aun el horario de trabajo requiere mucha fuerza de voluntad, pues al menos Sandra invierte 12 horas cada d\u00eda, desde que empieza a amanecer a la una de la madrugada, hasta las 13H00 o m\u00e1s. Sandra pide ayuda para obtener un pr\u00e9stamo el cual lo dedicar\u00e1 a comprar al por mayor frutas de temporada que son muy demandadas por los clientes. Los ingresos extra que se generen los invertir\u00e1 en el crecimiento de su negocio y en la educaci\u00f3n superior de su hija menor. Sandra dice que espera dejar huella en sus hijas y que cuando ellas se sientan realmente realizadas est\u00e9n convencidas que su madre cooper\u00f3 para llegar hasta all\u00ed, es por eso que inclusive planea capacitarse en donde aceptaron confiar en ella para prestarle el dinero, en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa una intermediaria de Kiva que capacita y fortalece los negocios de emprendedores con el objetivo de disminuir la pobreza en el pa\u00eds.","en":"Among the challenges all Ecuadoreans face to overcome the threat of poverty day to day is Sandra, a 42-year-old woman with many stories to tell but what\u2019s now of concern is her present and her and her daughters\u2019 future who even though they are now adults Sandra still hopes to see them reach their dreams since for her it was difficult to complete her schooling for lack of economic resources and because she took on the role of father and mother for her siblings since they were orphaned at a young age.  She\u2019s currently divorced living with her youngest daughter, Diana, in the southern part of Quito, Ecuador\u2019s capital city, specifically in Chillogallo.  Until a short time ago, the southern section of Quito wasn\u2019t much of a strong economic sector in the capital of the Republic of Ecuador.  Now, it\u2019s considered to be an economic strong point in the city\u2019s economy.  Enterprising families are found here that have struggled to stand out.  It\u2019s been a meeting point for natives and migrants from other cities and countries and for people from several provinces; it\u2019s been rebuilt with broad streets.\r\n\r\nSandra started a fruit and vegetable business 12 years ago and one of the biggest obstacles she\u2019s faced and one that meant a significant expenditure of money was when her oldest daughter was diagnosed with cancer which was treated and she\u2019s now in stable health.  \r\n\r\nSandra learned this activity from her aunt who taught her since she was a young girl about suppliers, accounts, etc.  Sandra developed it for her siblings so that she could move them forward and later she did it for her children.  It\u2019s very hard work that requires physical effort to lift the boxes of fruit to sort them and even the schedule requires much willpower because Sandra invests at least 12 hours daily from the moment she starts at one a.m. and goes until one p.m. or even later.\r\n\r\nSandra is asking for help to get a loan to buy seasonal fruit that has high customer demand at wholesale.  Extra income generated will be invested in her business\u2019 growth and in her youngest daughter\u2019s higher education.  Sandra says that she hopes to leave a print on her daughters so that when they are completely fulfilled they\u2019ll be sure to realize that their mother contributed to their getting there; this is why she\u2019s even planning on getting training where she was trusted enough to be lent the money at Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa which is a Kiva intermediary that trains and strengthens entrepreneurs\u2019 businesses aiming at lessening poverty in the country.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1246589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy seasonal fruit and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-11-29T23:50:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-29T23:50:32Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":626.88,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":71.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":76.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":78.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":80.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.49},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.42,"local_amount":71.77,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":74.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126220},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":75.78,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":78.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516827},{"amount":79.73,"local_amount":76.89,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":79.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068683},{"amount":81.49,"local_amount":78.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":81.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494949},{"amount":82.09,"local_amount":79.17,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":82.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524878},{"amount":83.4,"local_amount":80.44,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133182},{"amount":170.3,"local_amount":164.24,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":170.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313725}],"funded_date":"2012-12-09T23:43:15Z","paid_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":502519,"name":"Mame Coumba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mame Coumba est une femme mari\u00e9e qui habite au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

She buys chunks of wood from various sawmills located near her house and she takes them to her workshop to process into simple pieces, either slats or boards.  She then places everything she makes in her warehouse and then sells them from there individually.  She does all this process between the sawmills and the sales point at home.  \n\nShe\u2019s been working this way for a year and is doing very well.  She\u2019s very happy that she\u2019s doing well because her profit margin is good since she uses up all her product.

She has her ex husband\u2019s unconditional support and they work together to provide all the best for their family which is why she\u2019s asking for a 2,500 sol loan to buy lumber to start the process of turning it into slats and boards again.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1246623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy lumber.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-30T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-30T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":387.31},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":378.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":412.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":427.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":435.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":458.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":151.05,"local_amount":387.31,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":391.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188968},{"amount":147.53,"local_amount":378.29,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":382.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572865},{"amount":160.87,"local_amount":412.48,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":416.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122519},{"amount":166.87,"local_amount":427.86,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":432.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868347},{"amount":169.77,"local_amount":435.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":439.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577175},{"amount":178.91,"local_amount":458.74,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":463.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529419}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T14:32:38Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":502524,"name":"Nogaye","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Nogaye est mari\u00e9e et  habite au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

Hasta hace pocos a\u00f1os el sector sur de la ciudad de Quito, no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir.

She married young, but she was able to finish high school. She\u2019s currently separated and raising her children on her own \u2013 they\u2019re 13, 9 and 6 years old. Although the separation was a difficult time for her children and herself, together they have since become an exemplar family. They live in the Chimbacalle neighborhood that\u2019s located in the south of the city of Quito, which is the capital of the Republic of Ecuador. Up until the last few years, the southern part of Quito was not considered as playing a major part in the economy of the city, but now it\u2019s considered one of the city\u2019s economical strengths. In this area you\u2019ll find determined families who have fought to get ahead. From natives to migrants from other cities and countries, this area has been the meeting point of people from various provinces and has been reconstructed with extensive streets. Chimbacalle, where Lidia resides, is a very commercial neighborhood that is constantly growing and lends itself to the economic growth of the city. There are parks with big green spaces where families meet on the weekends. There is access to a great number of services and the people in this area, with determination, use every opportunity that presents itself to establish new businesses. In this area, you will see street vendors, working children and families in need.\r\nLidia is a street vendor and she's been selling casual clothing for 5 years. This undertaking was very important for her, as it was the only livelihood she had for her herself and her children since the separation. Previous to the separation, she worked as a street vendor and brought in some extra money, but it was more of a hobby; afterwards it became her fulltime job and the income now provides the education and wellbeing of her children. In the beginning, she sold only cosmetics, but there was demand for clothing, so she now dedicates about 6 hours or more each day to taking down orders from her clients, classifying the new clothing she has, delivering the orders to each address and collecting outstanding accounts. All of that work, while still attending to her children; helping them with homework, going over lessons and studying.\r\nLidia is requesting a loan to buy wholesale merchandise in order to get more discounts on her final bill. This will help increase her earnings so that one day she can accomplish her dream: owning her own clothing store that will help sustain her family and provide her children the opportunity to earn professional degrees that will take them further in life. Lidia is grateful that Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa believed in her enough to provide her with a loan and the training needed to visualize and project her business into the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1246486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She works permanently and has an established clientele.  She also raises small farm animals like pigs, sheep and barnyard fowl.  Norma has more than 6 years\u2019 experience in animal husbandry businesses.  Her husband works in agriculture on inherited land.  With the income they both earn they contribute towards moving their home forward.\r\n\r\nNorma would like day to day to tend to more customers with respect to the milk sales and this is why she wants to buy much more milk to resell later.

After starting this business with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS), through hard work Nazgul has developed it to the point where it currently earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Presently, Nazgul's herd includes 4 cows, 4 horses and 10 sheep. She sells their milk and dairy products from her home. Thanks to her business profits, Nazgul can pay for her family's main expenses.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Nazgul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional livestock. This will allow her to increase production of milk and, concomitantly, her family income. Nazgul plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business. In the future, she hopes to realize one of her long-time dreams and buy a

She works as a medical assistant in the local hospital. Her salary is 9,221 som. However, as Lena is the main income provider for her family, she also works in animal husbandry. She started her business with 5,000 som 33 years ago. Thanks to persistent work, she has been able to develop her farm so that milk sales provide her with a monthly profit of 6,000 som. Today she has one cow and three steer on her farm. \r\n\r\nWith long term development of her farm in mind, Lena turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 som to purchase four cows, which would allow her to increase her milk production and as a result her family's income. Lena plans to invest this new income to develop her farm and eventually to buy a home for her son.

","en":"Naarkul is a 58-year-old married woman. She did not complete her college education, but she has worked in farming for many years and has a wealth of experience. She started her business with 7,500 som in 1992. Thanks to persistent work, Naarkul was able to develop her farm and it now brings her a monthly profit of 5,000 som. Naarkul's husband and daughter actively help her run the business. They organize milk sales.

She is married and has two children, 21 and 7 years old. They are both school-going children. She has one additional dependent.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Rugiatu established her baby clothing and jewelry business. She began her business because her mother died when she was a child. Her father could not take good care of her, so he had to take her to a close friend who was a trader. She did not think it fit for her to attend school because she was not willing to pay her school fees. Instead, she was made into a house girl for several years. Later, he died and then her elder brother took her. They could barely feed her, let alone train her in school.  \r\n\r\nShe started trading with him in order to help in the running of the home. She has been a trader ever since she was a child and started her own business years later.  \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 740,000 every month from this business. Rainy season is her major challenge for her business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000. \r\n\r\nRugiatu has already received and successfully repaid three loans, and now she requires a new loan in order to purchase women's underwear - 40 dozen @ Le 18,000; women's blouses - 20 dozen @ Le 150,000; baby wrappers - 3 dozen @ Le 216,000. The balance of Le 132,000 will be used as transport. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Rugiatu plans to build a house and open a shop for her growing business. She wants her children to have a good education. The loan will help her as it is her only additional income. Her business is growing gradually and require enough capital to operate effectively, so she is looking forward to paying her loan in order to acquire subsequent loans. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1246337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is married and has eight children. For the past five years, Hajara has been working hard to manage her poultry farm, where she looks after chicks, raising both layers and boilers. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hajara has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

Papua is one if the poorest of Indonesia\u2019s provinces and is plagued by social unrest. By selling Nazava Water Filters Meteda and his wife can acquire additional daily income. In just 3 months, Meteda sold 100 water filters and provided over 500 people with access to safe and affordable drinking water. \n\nMeteda sells water filters to both rich and poor because everybody is in need of ways to clean their drinking water. Compared to buying water, households save $132 USD per year using Nazava water filters, which enable them to purify rain, well or river water and make it safe to drink. \n\nThe water filters that Nazava sells are assembled on the Indonesian Island of Java 3000 km from Mr. Meteda. Shipping them takes often more than 3 weeks. \n\n\u201cTransport takes very long and I currently have the cash for just 12 filters, that\u2019s why I often have to disappoint consumers because I quickly run out of stock\u201c, says Mr, Meteda.\n\nTo fulfill the high need of Nazava water filters in his region, Meteda desires to buy a larger amount at reduced transport costs. \n\nWith a 1100 USD loan, Mr Meteda can make safe drinking water available to 500 people in just 1 month. The loan allows him to purchase around 100 water filters at a reduced price and with reduced transportation costs. This will help more households in obtaining safe drinking water, augment their disposable income as well as the profit for Meteda\u2019s family.

She is not married and she lives with her parents.  She is a very focused and hard-working young woman.  Farogat did not have an opportunity to go to university and receive a higher specialization after she graduated from high school, so she decided to become an entrepreneur and to fulfill her plans that way.  With that goal in mind, she completed the \"Get Ahead\" course organized by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her business and becoming successful in that sphere.  Farogat wants to start a business buying and selling children's clothing.  She would like to use the income from her business to buy the necessary things for her dowry, such as clothing, items of gold, perfume, etc, as she plans to get married if she meets a good young man.  Farogat is asking for a loan of 3,000 somoni to buy the goods to start her business.  She is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1246274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

45-year-old, happily married man. He lives in the town of Pucallpa with his wife and four small children, whom he loves dearly and who are his main reason for living. He is a friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who, together with his wife, dedicates all of his efforts to ensure that his family get ahead. Rolando was not able to study to become a professional because, from a very young age, he had to work, in order to help his parents with the household expenses. However, he would very much have liked to have been able to study to be a car mechanic. In his free time he likes to play football with his friends and neighbours, and sometimes his wife spoils him and cooks him delicious chicken with rice.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of determination and dedication, and thanks to the help of a friend, Rolando set up his small business cutting keys. He starts work early in the morning every day. He has about 10 hours of work, and thinks that his business is going well because of the quality of his work and the friendly way he deals with his customers.\r\n\r\nRolando is very grateful for the Kiva loans, as thanks to the help that they provide, he will be able to make some improvements to his home by painting and decorating it. In this way, Rolando hopes to provide a more adequate and safe environment, where his family can live safely. In this way, he will continue working and striving to achieve his dream of owning his own hardware store and of seeing his children grow up to be good professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1224913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to make improvements to his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:10:50Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:10:50Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rolando Alcides ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":79.8},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":85.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":90.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.17,"local_amount":147.93,"processed_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":152.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089322},{"amount":33.02,"local_amount":82.54,"processed_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":85.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478859},{"amount":34.39,"local_amount":85.98,"processed_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031533},{"amount":36.14,"local_amount":90.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":93.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776028},{"amount":37.28,"local_amount":93.21,"processed_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482841}],"funded_date":"2012-12-03T22:35:39Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:44:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ana Maria Edlin","image":null}},{"id":489478,"name":"Fidencio Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. fidencio tiene la edad de 50 a\u00f1os y en esta ocasi\u00f3n esta solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo de Credituyo para equipar de mercanc\u00eda su dulcer\u00eda ya que se ah quedado con muy poca y desea un poco mas de ventas, el Sr. fidencio es casado con 2 hijos comenta que las ventas han estado un poco bajas por la misma raz\u00f3n de la poca mercanc\u00eda la dulcer\u00eda del Sr. fidencio tiene una antig\u00fcedad de 3 a\u00f1os.","en":"Fidencio, 50, is requesting this loan from Credituyo to stock his candy store with merchandise because he doesn't have very much and he wants more sales.\n\nFidencio is married and has two children.
