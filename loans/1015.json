She has four dependent children, all of whom are in school. To support her family, she plants cassava on a one-hectare farm and takes various jobs where she works for a salary. Each day, she is able to earn approximately 19,000 KHR and manages to save around 12,000 KHR after offsetting the daily cost of living. She has already taken out and repaid previous loans from VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), and has made good use of the money to improve her family's living standards. She is requesting a new loan to buy gasoline and to cover the cost of hiring people to work on her farm. She leads a four-person loan group whose members are requesting a loan for 4,100,000 KHR. Hieat strongly believes that she can use her portion of this loan, which is for 1,000,000 KHR, to provide her family with a better life. She will use the profits she expects to earn to bring her dream house to life and buy a new motorbike to make the transportation from her home to her rice field easier.

his parent's home in Ca\u00f1ete, which is in the district of Imperial. He is a kind, hard-working, and enthusiatic person. Elvis and his wife put all their efforts into providing for their family. Unfortunately, a lack of financial resources and the need to work to cover the household expenses meant he could not study for an Education degree as he would have wished and would have liked to have done. \r\n\r\nThanks to his committment, effort and the money he saved while working at a bakery, Elvis was able to buy his own motor-rickshaw which he drives and uses to provide a transport service. Everyday from early in the morning he drives through the city's streets searching for passengers. He believes he does well because he is responsible and because he treats his clients well. \r\n\r\nElvis is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help he will be able to carry out much-needed repairs and general maintenance for his motor-rickshaw. His tool of the trade will then be in better condition and this will help him increase his income. Elvis hopes to, bit by bit, ensure his young son's well-being and education, and perhaps, in the near future he will be able to achieve his greatest dream: to have his own house. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1230931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to carry out repairs and general maintenance for his motor-rickshaw.

She is able to save about 20,000 KHR per day after expenses for her family's future needs.\r\n\r\nMom has been with VisionFund for two cycles and completely repaid back her past loans, which have helped her relieve her family\u2019s burdens and improve their livelihood. Now she is leading her group of four to request a new loan. Mom, who is the leader, will use her portion to buy fertilizer for her farm; she will also use a portion of it to buy rubber seedlings for her rubber planting business. She hopes to gain a high crop yields from her plantation business, which she can sell for a good price. She will use the profits to improve her standard of living. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1231780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for her farm.

Cambodia. He makes a living through rice crops, which he has been doing for 4 years, and his wife also generates additional income through running a fee based boat facility. He is able to earn up to 8,900 KHR per day.  All of his income is used mainly to cover the daily food expenses for his three children as two of them are still in school and a remaining kid is a young little one.

She and one of her co-borrowers are each seeking 1,000,000 KHR while the other two members are requesting 1,400,000 KHR each.

Rem is now in need of money to support her rice field. Thus, she is leading a loan group of two female members, who both have been with VisionFund for a loan cycle already, to apply for a loan in the amount of 450,000 KHR in total. The past loan that Rem successfully paid back has allowed her to make the family's lifestyle so much better, which makes her so satisfied. Now with her new requested loan portion in this loan, which is 300,000 KHR, Rem will utilize it even more efficiently than the previous one. She will purchase fertilizer to help keep her rice field in good shape. Rem has high hopes that she can boost her income with the help of her loan portion and use the income generated by the rice-growing business, to send her beloved sons to school in the future.

Some of her children are employed as paid workers in Phonm Penh (capital city of Cambodia) and some are students. To generate resources needed for her home, Dieab has a business selling grocery items which enables her to earn around 26,000KHR per day. Dieab is leading a loan group of three female members, who all have been with VisionFund (Kiva's partner) for six loan cycles already, to take out a loan in the amount of 1,400,000KHR each. The previous loans have enabled the group representative, Dieab, to see the improvement in her family's living standard. Dieab will spend some portion of her loan portion on purchasing more grocery items such as sugar, salt, shampoo, soap, instant noodle, canned items, etc. to sell in order to make her customers satisfied.

In hope of helping her husband runs his business smoothly, Chreb is now leading a loan group of three members to take out a loan in the amount of 2,200,000KHR in total. This group representative (Chreb) will use the loan portion of her loan, which is 700,000KHR, to purchase fishing materials such as fish traps and cast net.

In 2011, the group was formed and functions as a joint liability group to help one another.\n\nMuonkim, with her hand raised, is the group leader. She is a widow and a mother of four sons. All her children go to an orphanage school nearby.  The eldest son, 12 years of age, is under the foster care of her parents. Muonkim lives with her other three sons and her mother-in-law. Being the sole earner of the family, her main source of income used to be a small shop where she sold cigarettes, paan and the like. \n\nWith her first loan of INR 5000 and help from her parents and friends, she started a clothing business because she believed she was able to make more profits to provide for her family. Initially, she sold clothes door to door, but now with her second loan of INR 10,000 and with some of her savings, she was able to construct a small store where she sells clothes now. She named her store \u201cFlying Business\u201d and employs one of her nieces to run the store while she is engaged in bringing in clothes to sell. She deals in mostly ladies garments such as warm pants, sweaters, tops, T-Shirts and half-pants for kids. To be precise, she sells clothes according to the season  \n \nShe usually goes to Dimapur in Nagaland, a neighbouring state, to buy clothes for her store. She also visits Moreh town (Bordering Myanmar- 180 km away) for the same purpose according to the demands and convenience.\n\nWith great hopes, she plans to save as much as possible until her children come of age where money will be a deciding factor if she will be able to support their higher education. She said, \u201cI dream that one day my sons will protect and feed me. It is my responsibility to give them a good education so that they may get employment opportunities when their time comes. This thought and hope wants me to live another day.\u201d\n\nShe requested another loan to increase her stock of winter clothing such as sweaters, warm pants, tops and warm stockings for ladies as well as for kids. She plans to invest the whole loan amount on these items. \n\nThe other group members are also working very hard and conducting group meetings twice a month to share and guide each other to do better with their respective business. They all needed another loan in order to stock their inventory with the Christmas celebration and Thanksgiving looming ahead. The group members' income-generating activities include a butcher shop, charcoal sales, supplying fresh and organic vegetables in the market and a clothing shop. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1234295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":" To buy winter garments such as sweaters, warm stockings, jackets and pants for kids to sell.
