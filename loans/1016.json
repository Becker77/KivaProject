She has a small farm and every three months she buys chicks to raise for two to three months and once they reach adequate weight she sells them either live or by the pound.  She sells to merchants and also sells at home to her local neighbors.  She buys the chicks from an incubator in Portoviejo and has been in this line of work for more than 14 years; she likes it because she can earn a little without having to leave home and with a minimum of effort.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy more chicks and feed for them since the Christmas and New Year\u2019s season is approaching and she sells quite a bit those days at good prices.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank for 9 years and likes it because the institution always follows through with the members.

He is a teacher in Ivirgarzama and has worked in this teaching unit for four years now. He lives near the highway to Puerto Villarroel where he has a small plot of land, and works together with his family. For three years now he has earned a living poultry farming. Every year he increases his production of broiler chickens. This year he has added a shed that is approximately 450 square metres with a capacity for 1500 chickens. \r\n\r\nBenjamin is a responsible person who is dedicated to his work. He does the marketing personally in order to have a higher income, saying that \"If I hire people, they do not work the same as oneself\". He is not a member of any association because he has a small, rustic slaughterhouse to slaughter the chickens and he has a fixed buyer. As he mentioned earlier he has increased his production. Now he does not have the money for the next phase of production, for this reason he needs the money to buy animal feed for his chickens.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1236151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animal feed for his chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:14:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:14:32Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benjamin Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125.02,"local_amount":850.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":863.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331103957},{"amount":124.98,"local_amount":849.89,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":863.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355790606},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1700.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1727.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382130952},{"amount":125,"local_amount":849.84,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":863.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399792994},{"amount":125,"local_amount":850.28,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":863.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419832990},{"amount":750,"local_amount":5099.72,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5181.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429487574}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T21:31:24Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T14:22:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Huras","image":null}},{"id":496286,"name":"Sabino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Sabino, tiene 56 a\u00f1os de edad, su unidad familiar est\u00e1 compuesta por de 4 miembros, es de una familia humilde de escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos por tanto cultiva superficies muy peque\u00f1as, vive en la comunidad de Sauces del municipio de Mizque del departamento de Cochabamba.

He used previous loans to buy a plot of land on which to build a house; to buy welding machines; and to cover household expenses and school fees. Said has successfully paid back all of his loans. \r\n\r\nSaid now hopes for a loan to increase his grocery inventory. His dream is to one day be able to own a hardware business. He will share this loan with his loan group, \"Mbayuwayu Group,\" which totals eleven members. The members of the group will hold one another accountable for paying back the loan.

As the group leader, Srey Nganh, will utilize a portion of her loan to purchase fertilizer and rice seed to help keep her rice field in good shape.  She will spend the other portion of her loan to buy gasoline.  This hard-working woman would love to see the improvement in her business as well as an increase in the profit she earns.  She will use the anticipated income to move her family ahead and, most importantly, to advance her beloved children\u2019s education as far as possible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1238785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizer and rice seed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:16:39Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:16:39Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Srey Nganh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1440000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1497000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841748},{"amount":250,"local_amount":960000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":998000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420332521}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T05:08:05Z","paid_date":"2013-11-19T10:39:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":497671,"name":"Franklin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Franklin lives in an area where the major source of income comes from the farming of corn crops.

greater Accra region of Ghana. This group is made up of 14 people who are searching continuously for opportunities to make a headway in business, and to bring a better future to their children through their daily efforts. The primary business activities of the members are, for example: food sales, sales of crafts, a grocery store, fuel sales, drinks, fish, meat, fruit, sandals, materials, and much more.\r\n\r\nMabel is a member of the group and her primary economic success has been in the sales of sandals and fruits like pineapple, pawpaw (papaya), grapes, and bananas. She runs a shop where she sells sandals and fruits, from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., at her residence. She buys items from the market and supplies part to her punctual customers and sells part to the nearby customers. It has been 10 years since she began this business, and it is going very well for her, thanks to the effort she puts into her work and the support she received from ID-Ghana through Kiva. At this time, Mabel is in need of a loan of 1,000 Ghana cedis (GHS) to buy enough fruits and sandals to supply to customers. With Christmas approaching, customers are demanding for childrens' sandals for the celebration.\r\n\r\nThe members as a whole are thankful for the opportunity that has been offered and promise to make payments of each of their different loans on schedule as arranged. The group needs a total amount of 9,800 GHS to improve their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5225,"image":{"id":1235836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

He is 52 years old, married and has three children.  One of his children is married. His second child is an overseas Filipino worker and his youngest is still studying.\r\n\r\nBenito's wife is a city aid in Santiago. According to Benito, he started cultivating his farm in 1980. For long periods of time, devoted by Benito in his rice field, he has been able to sustain his family's basic needs, send his three children to school and improve their financial stability. Benito is now happy to see that the fruit of his sacrifices and perseverance improves their lives.  He and his wife are not yet satisfied with their business career so he is asking for additional capital amounting to 20,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). This loan amount will be used to buy fertilizer and some of the amount will be used to pay for land preparation of his rice field. Benito hopes to obtain his requested loan amount in order to have a viable source of income and allow his youngest child to finish his studies.

He is not married and he lives with his parents.  Abdukahor has not received a higher eduction.  His business is buying and selling dried fruits (apricots) in the market.  He buys dried fruits and transports them to another town.  He has been in this line of work for more than seven years.  Aside from this, he also works in construction, but his main income is from the dried fruits.  Abdukahor is asking for a loan to expand his business; he wants to buy a few bags of dried fruits as they will be very useful over the winter.  In the words of this client, he is very grateful for organizations like MDO Arvand and he hopes for further cooperation with

She is married and blessed with one son. To provide a decent life for her family, Sophy has been working tirelessly as a rice farmer on a two-hectare plot of farmland for four years. She earns around 17,000KHR per day and is able to save approximately 12,000KHR after deducting the daily cost of living. This diligent woman has been with VisionFund (Kiva's partner) for one loan cycle already. She has succeeded in making her family's life so much better. \r\n\r\nNow she is in need of money to support her rice-growing business. This business provides the main source of income for her family. Sophy is leading a loan group of three female members to take out a loan in the amount of 2,500,000KHR in total. Sophy, the group leader, will utilize some portion of her loan to support her rice field by buying fertilizer and pesticide.

To achieve this, he needs to buy raw materials to begin his biggest dream: to have his own business.\r\n\r\nFabian began to set up his workshop in back of his house due to his current economic situation, but he dreams of soon having a location that will allow him to have access to a greater number of clients generating more income which will let him obtain a better quality of life for himself and for his family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1241549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw material for the manufacture of horseshoes.
