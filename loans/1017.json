The current business earns Hen about 8,000 Cambodian riels (KHR) per day; she manages to save about 2,000 KHR each day after daily expenses.\r\n\r\nHen\u2019s Group consists of four members who live in the same village. Hen has been with VisionFund for two cycles and completely paid back her past loans, which have helped her to relieve the burden on her family and improve their livelihood. Now she is leading her group to seek a new loan. As the leader, Hen will use her portion of the loan to buy fertilizers for her farmland. She hopes this loan will enable her to grow her rice healthily and also hopes to produce more rice to improve her family\u2019s standard living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1242017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Tbaung Khmum district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:21:39Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:21:39Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Men","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2800000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1001369.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381838166},{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":600821.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410225578},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1201643.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420332552}],"funded_date":"2012-12-01T16:52:13Z","paid_date":"2013-11-19T10:40:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Supryia Ray","image":null}},{"id":499911,"name":"Kilwin Benkadi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme MARIAM repr\u00e9sente le  groupe KILWIN BENKADI.

Babita is one of them. The lady standing second from left with yellow sari is Babita. She is 38 years of age, and is a straightforward, confident and hardworking lady, living with her husband, one son aged 15, and two daughters aged 17 and 12 who are studying in college.\r\n\r\nBabita is running a dairy farm with 15 cows. Her husband helps her in nurturing the cows and the milk supply. The primary work of Babita is to clean the cow shed every morning and keep the shed clean. Babita gets 20 liters of milk daily and supplies it to a sweet stall in her town. She gets payment from the stall owner on weekly basis. Babita earns a monthly net income of 6000 Indian Rupees (INR) but it is not sufficient to manage her household expenses along with the educational expenses of her children.

She\u2019s the mother of five children and sells food.  She came to this tropical area from Entre R\u00edos, looking for better work opportunities because the river floods really affected her community and crops.  There was barely enough left on which to survive.  She says that she arrived at her uncle\u2019s home with a just few pieces of clothing.  That is where she met her husband.  During her first few years she would work as a field hand on a parcel of her uncle\u2019s farm land.  She was not able to find steady work.  Little by little she began learning the food business and began to focus on this field.  She works very hard to get her children ahead so that they want for nothing in the future.  Over time she began saving up and now wants to buy a parcel of land.

Her husband is a taxi driver, but his income is inadequate to fulfill the family needs and household expenses. \r\n\r\nManseeda herself is an efficient and hard-working tailor. For the past six years she has been running a small tailoring business in her home. She provides tailoring services in her community. All of her customers appreciate her, for her efficient and excellent skills. Her income is playing a vital role in the family's income, so she wants to continue it in the future as well.\r\n\r\nBut currently her tailoring stock is not enough, and her sewing machine has stopped working. Therefore, she is unable to continue her business. She lacks the money she needs, to buy the things she requires to resume her business.

Nowadays she is facing difficulties in meeting orders on time due to a shortage of stitching material. Due to her trust in Kashf Foundation, she applied for a repeat loan of Rs 10,000. It would help her to purchase stitching material such as spools of threads with packs of buttons, laces and zippers in different colors.  She wishes to utilize part of the profits to provide quality education to her children.

A few years after finishing high school she met her current partner, with whom she has a 3-year-old dependant.  Although they live in one of her mother's houses, their goal is to be independent.  In order to achieve this they are seeking to increase their income.  The family worked together to be able to afford an agricultural plot.  After much effort they succeeded in buying two plots, on which they grow bananas, frying plantains and other crops.  However, in order to keep investing in their crops they need more funds.

She also has flooded fields, since the river passes through the area where she lives and she retains the water to irrigate the fields. She does this with the help of her husband. They have been doing this activity for more than 10 years. She buys the agricultural supplies that she needs for the planting in an agricultural services store in the city, which is two kilometers from her home. The loan will be invested the purchase of seeds, fertilizer, manure, pest and weed control so that the crop isn't damaged, lease payments on the land, and payment of laborers, among other things.\r\n\r\nThe main need that will be met with the loan is the planting of 7,000 square meters of corn, because the land is ready and they have the workers ready to carry it out. She is also forging the family's future since they will have a higher income that will help out a lot. With the sale of the corn, she will have the income to maintain the family and this way their quality of life will be much better than it is not. Her plan for the future (depending on how the sale of the corn goes) is to purchase 7,000 square meters of land to plant basic grains.

She has made tortillas for several years, and this has given her valuable experience that allows her to generate the most profit. Her business is located in her home, and she sells to all the people in the area. She is well known because her tortillas are the hottest and most delicious. She makes them with the finest quality ingredients and sells them at accessible prices. She also has the fastest service. Lorenza is determined and dedicated to her work.

She hopes that Kiva lenders will provide more funds to help others in order to lift their beloved family from poverty.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1243807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Though her sons and her husband are earning, still their income is insufficient to meet the family's needs. They are passing through a very difficult time because Nasreen has a big family and more people to eat than earning ones. \r\n\r\nNasreen is trying to contribute some amount to her family's income by stitching clothes at home. She provides tailor services in her community. Her monthly income is only 500 Pkr. She wants to generate more income by purchasing a new sewing machine.

With the passage of time her sales increased, as did her income. Now she has seven buffaloes and two cows. This has all happened due to her hard work and determination. Her husband is happy with her support and respects her a lot. While talking to the Kashf officer, she shared the feeling of achievement she got by renovating her house with the profit she earned through her business. She is in her 3rd loan cycle with Kashf Foundation and has shown good repayment behavior. She has some savings and applied for a loan of PKR 30,000 to purchase another buffalo. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.

She lives with her husband and parents-in-law, who are provided with a retirement pension. The family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they have a milk cow and a calf, produce cheese and sell locally in an open market at a good price. In addition, they have a vineyard and sell grapes locally.
