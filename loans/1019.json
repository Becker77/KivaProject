She is a very shy lady of 45 years who lives with her husband and one son who is 20 years old and studying in an engineering college out of state. She also has two daughters who are married and staying in their in-law\u2019s houses. The lady standing on the extreme right with her hand raised is Sujata, the leader of the group.\n\nKanak has been running a screen printing and polymer stamp making unit in her house with the help of her husband for the last 20 years. Kanak takes orders for printing invitation cards and making polymer stamps and supplies ready made invitation cards to the customers. Her daily net income in marriage season (December-June) is 2000 INR and in normal season is 500 to 1000 INR. Her husband purchases the materials like chemicals, paper, polymer, color etc from the nearest wholesale market in Bolangir. To help her with the screen printing, she has engaged two skilled workers. Due to the quality work and timely delivery, her business has name and fame in the locality.  With the loan, Kanak wants to purchase cards, polymer, color and chemicals in bulk to reduce the purchasing cost as she replenishes her stock frequently. Kanak says that with this business she married her two daughters in a befitting manner and was able to send her son to school for his engineering degree. Now she hopes to construct a pucca house as the present house is a tile one.\n \nThe other three members of the group are Sujata, Chandrama and Bhumi who run a General store, a Tent House and a fast food center.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1240486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase cards, polymer, color and chemicals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-12-03T08:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-02T08:10:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sujata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhumi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T03:36:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":499739,"name":"Geraldine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geraldine is a 29-year-old married woman and mother of two young children from Getafe, Bohol.

Both of them get a monthly salary.  \r\n\r\nAs the existing income is not enough for the family, Robert decided to start a new business.  In particular, he plans to renovate his house properly and rent the rooms. Robert has requested a loan from the local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but without any success.  His loan request was rejected each time because of lack of experience in his new business which is usually demanded by local credit providers.  \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.  With the requested loan, Robert will purchase building materials to renovate the house properly for satisfying the personal needs of his clients.  Robert hopes his business will be profitable and this will increase his income and the family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs, in order to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1247846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan families and are also used to make fresh punch.  Her monthly income is 80 AZN. Raising crops is taking a lot of strength and working in the open air, which is very hard for her and that is why her son helps Brilyant. \r\n\r\nShe needs additional capital to purchase seeds and fertilizers. This will allow her to improve the quality of products that she raises and increase the monthly yield.  For this purpose she applied for 1600 AZN.

People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan families and are also used to make fresh punch.\r\n\r\nAli sells his crop in the Bilasuvar central bazaar twice a month. His monthly income is 100 AZN. His father actively helps him to raise the crops.\r\n\r\nAs these products are in high demand, Ali wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover the market demand. For this purpose he applied for 1800 AZN. He will buy new garden tools, seeds and fertilizers.

She chose this business because it is profitable and her fresh crop is in high demand. People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan families and are also used to make fresh punch.\r\n\r\nNazima sells her crop and fodder in the central bazaar and from her home. Her monthly income is 150 AZN. Her husband is a builder, but does not have a permanent job, and he actively helps her to raise the crops.\r\n\r\nAs these products are in high demand, Nazima wants to expand the business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover the market demand. For this purpose she applied for 1800 AZN. She will buy new garden tools, seeds and fertilizers.

He lives in Bilasuvar, an IDP settlement, with his wife and three children. He is a farmer who has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the past 10 years. During these years, Vagif gained enough skills and experience to run his business. He chose this crop business because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. \r\n\r\nPeople use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan and are also used to make fresh punch. Vaqif usually sells his crops in the central bazaar every week.

En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles. Eufemia reside en el sector  de Chimbacalle, en la ferroviaria baja, un barrio ubicado en el sector sur de la ciudad, un sector con una alta actividad comercial que es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y que aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios. Los migrantes de varias provincias del pa\u00eds residen en este sector y ponen a prueba sus habilidades y destrezas para salir adelante con la puesta en marcha de negocios que son establecidos emp\u00edricamente en su mayor\u00eda. \nEufemia es una mujer de 60 a\u00f1os, trabajadora que nunca ha dejado de luchar por conseguir sus sue\u00f1os, termin\u00f3 el colegio y luego se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar porque la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en su hogar no le pod\u00eda proveer los estudios superiores. Siendo joven se cas\u00f3 y tuvo 3 hijos que ahora son adultos Edison de 42 a\u00f1os, Patricio de 40 y Juan Carlos de 32. Eufemia ahora est\u00e1 divorciada y vive sola, pero considera que independientemente de su situaci\u00f3n puede salir adelante y la prueba de eso es que hace 4 a\u00f1os abri\u00f3 un lugar peque\u00f1o en el cual vende comida r\u00e1pida y tradicional que era muy demandada en el lugar por estudiantes, vecinos y trabajadores del sector. Esta actividad le ha ayudado a tener una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y adem\u00e1s puede disfrutar en sus tiempos libres de sus familiares. En ocho horas del d\u00eda, Eufemia asea los alimentos, los prepara y atiende a cada cliente que llega. Ahora con la experiencia que ha adquirido est\u00e1 segura de que puede hacer crecer su negocio, por lo que acudi\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quien a trav\u00e9s de Kiva, le otorgan un cr\u00e9dito para que ella compre mercader\u00eda como golosinas o productos de consumo inmediato que se puedan combinar o complementar con el servicio que ella presta.  Eufemia espera incrementar sus ingresos para mantener un ahorro que lo pueda utilizar en los a\u00f1os que su edad y las complicaciones de salud que esto conlleva ya no le permitan trabajar.","en":"Just a little while ago, the southern part of the city of Quito was no considered one of the economic strongholds of the Ecuadorian capital. Now this area is an economic force in the city. There are enterprising families in this place that have fought to stand out. There are natives and migrants from other cities and countries, and it has been a meeting point for people from various provinces. It has extensive streets. \r\n\r\nEufemia lives in the Chimbacalle area, in Ferroviaria Baja, a neighborhood located in the southern part of the city, an area with a lot of commercial activity that keeps growing and greatly contributes to the economic growth of the city. The parks with their large green areas stand out in this zone. Families go to them on weekends. There is access to all kinds of services and its inhabitants are entrepreneurs who take advantage of every opportunity that presents itself when it comes to setting up new businesses. Migrants from various provinces of the country live here and they put their skills to the test to move forward by setting up businesses, most of which are established through experience. \r\n\r\nEufemia, 60, is a hard-working woman who has never stopped fighting to achieve her dreams. She finished high school and then started working, because the economic situation in her household did not permit her to study further. While young, she married and had three sons who are now grown: Edison, 42, Patricio, 40, and Juan Carlos, 32. Eufemia is now divorced and lives alone, but she believes that she can move forward regardless of her situation. The proof of this is that four years ago, she opened a small place in which she sells traditional fast foods, which were in high demand by the students, residents, and workers in the area. This activity has helped to give her economic stability and she can also enjoy free time with her relatives. \r\n\r\nFor eight hours a day, Eufemia cleans the foods, prepares them and attends to each one of her customers. Now with the experience she has gained, she is sure she will be able to grow her business, which is why she went to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa through Kiva. They give her a loan so that she can buy merchandise like sweets and goods for immediate consumption that can complement or be combined with the services that she provides. Eufemia hopes to increase her income to maintain some savings that she can use when her age and the health complications that come with it no longer permit her to work.

In search of a source of income for the family, Gulzat started working with livestock breeding. Having started with 30,000 som (KGS) in 2007, the farm today brings in around 20,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy products and reselling livestock. Thanks to Gulzat's persistent work, her farm today counts three cows and 15 sheep. \n\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulzat turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep at a very low price.

instituci\u00f3n aunque poco a poco ha aumentado el n\u00famero de integrantes. Los integrantes comentan que eligieron dicho nombre pues tardaban mucho en decidirlo cuando empez\u00f3 a atardecer y alguien finalmente propuso el nombre. Francisca quien es una integrante del grupo, com\u00fanmente conocida como Mary, tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Gustavo desde hace 20 a\u00f1os y han formado una familia con dos hijas una de ellas se encuentra aun estudiando una carrera universitaria. La se\u00f1ora Mary tiene una tienda de abarrotes desde hace 15 a\u00f1os  y la inicio porque quer\u00eda ayudar con los gastos del hogar, Do\u00f1a Mary comenta \u201cInici\u00e9 vendiendo afuera de mi casa dulces solo en una mesita chica donde pon\u00eda diferentes tipos de dulces pero poco a poco fui vendiendo m\u00e1s productos como huevo, leche, pan etc. Estos productos los compraban las se\u00f1oras y con los dulces me iba muy bien ya que cada vez que pasaban los ni\u00f1os me compraban, con el tiempo decidimos poner un local ya mejor establecido y gracias al cr\u00e9dito he podido levantarla poco a poco\u201d. Esta vez la se\u00f1ora Mary esta solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para poder abastecer su tienda de abarrotes ya que con el cr\u00e9dito otorgado podr\u00e1 comprar mas leche, huevo, pan, aceite, frijoles, lentejas,  etc. Aunque una de las dificultades de Do\u00f1a Mary es la falta de dinero para poder seguir invirtiendo m\u00e1s en su tienda de abarrotes porque muchas veces se le termina muy r\u00e1pido su mercanc\u00eda y mas los productos que se consumen. A pesar de las dificultades que tiene que superar Mary, su sue\u00f1o es que su peque\u00f1a tienda pueda llegar a convertirse en un gran s\u00faper porque a\u00ed podr\u00e1 solventar los gastos de la educaci\u00f3n de su hija Bianca para que pueda terminar su carrera en comunicaci\u00f3n.

The members say that they chose this name, as they were taking a very long time in deciding it when it began to get dark, and someone proposed the name. \r\n\r\nFrancisca is a member of the group, and is commonly known as Mary. She is 40 years old, and has been married to Gustavo for 20 years. They have created a family, with two daughters; one of them still at university. Mary has had a grocery store for 15 years, and started it because she wanted to help with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nMary says, \"I started selling candy outside my home, just at a small table where I put various types of candy, but gradually I started selling more products such as eggs, milk, bread, etc. The ladies bought these products, and the candy sales were going well, as each time the children passed by they would buy. With time, we decided to set up a shop, now better established, and thanks to the loan, I have been able to build it up little by little.\"  \r\n\r\nThis time, Mary is requesting the loan so that she can stock her grocery store, as with the loan she has been granted she will be able to buy more milk, eggs, bread,  cooking oil, beans, lentils, etc. One of Mary's difficulties is lack of money to be able to continue investing more in her grocery store, because many times the merchandise runs out very quickly, especially the products used daily. \r\n\r\nIn spite of the difficulties Mary has to overcome, her dream is that her small store can eventually become a large minimart. That way she will be able to cover her daughter Bianca's education expenses, so that she can finish her degree in communications. \r\n\r\nAlong with Mary, the other group members also have their activities: In\u00e9s will also invest in her grocery store, Victor and Eva will invest in shhep, M\u00f3nica and Maricela will invest in the sale of clothing, Graciela will invest in candy, and finally, \u00c1ngeles will invest in her recycling center.\r\n\r\nThe entire group is very happy and grateful for the successes obtained in their families and businesses, thanks to the credit that VisionFund and Kiva grant them.

This is his story:\r\n\r\nA great paradox is lived in Colombia: we are the second-richest country in flora and fauna and we possess minerals in great amounts but we have one of the highest poverty indexes in all Latin America and educational outcomes are among the lowest which show how little pertinence education has in this region.\r\n\r\nMy mother has always stressed: \u201cIt\u2019s not important how much you know if you don\u2019t put it to use serving those most in need,\u201d and this is why I believe that getting a Master\u2019s in Education Policy and Administration would make no sense if not aimed at improving the educational conditions existent today in my place of birth, in Choc\u00f3 and in Colombia.  In my understanding, a pertinent education does exist when it\u2019s aimed at exploiting all the abilities and realities the residents in a region have and directing them towards that region\u2019s development.\r\n\r\nAt my return to Colombia, I see myself generating new educational policies that will be aimed at a more pertinent education that will be focused on regional needs rather than on copies of foreign models that do not adjust to our own realities thus promoting the use of our strengths.\r\n\r\nWhenever I\u2019ve wanted to do something, I\u2019ve been able to and being a Kiva beneficiary would prove once more that where there\u2019s a will a path will always appear.  And even though the road and the work I have before me is long and hard, I will only give up when my last breath leaves my being because in the final analysis, \u201cvictory belongs to those who make the effort.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1248160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Since she was in secondary school she was interested in sewing because she was in the dressmaking workshop.  From there she began to design her first creations.\r\n\r\nShe says that she's asking for a loan right now to buy material such as zippers, fabric in different textures and colors, thread, needles, etc.\r\n\r\nShe makes pants, blouses, shirts, nightgowns, sheets, blankets, and many other designs.  She's going to go to Mexico City to stock up because they have lower prices and she'll have enough money to buy all the materials she needs.

She comments that this field gives her a lot of profits because the city is beginning to grow and there's more construction and a need for their services in the area of metallic carpentry.  The places where they're needed are farther away all the time, so they have a way to transport their welding machine, metal cutter, and other work tools.\r\n\r\nIt's going very well for her because she has more customers all the time, which allows her to generate a regular income.

Su \u00fanica dificultad es la falta de material ya que cuando tiene pedidos para entregar le hace falta dinero pero gracias al cr\u00e9dito que le otorgar\u00e1 la instituci\u00f3n podr\u00e1 entregar sus bordados a tiempo. La meta de Do\u00f1a Julia es que su hijo termine su carrera profesional y pueda tener una mejor calidad de vida. Las integrantes son Antonia, Marcelina, Julia, quienes tambi\u00e9n se dedican al bordado, ellas comentan que en la comunidad donde viven es lo que m\u00e1s se dedican porque muchas veces sus artesan\u00edas las ocupan para recuerdos de bodas.","en":"El Mirador Group had worked previously with the institution, only there were more members and they met every time they made a payment.  This time there are fewer people, but all of them are very responsible.  The members decided on the name, which they chose because they all know a ranch called El Mirador.\r\n\r\nJulia, 41, is the group representative.  She has been married to Valent\u00edn for 22 years and together they have formed a family with two children, one of whom is a student.  Julia has made a living for 14 years doing embroidery on napkins, textiles, etc.\r\n\r\nJulia commented: \"I started my job because my children were my motivation.  They were studying, and often there wasn't enough money to pay for all the household expenses.  I had to learn alone; also because my mother embroidered.\"  Her only difficulty is the lack of material because when she has orders to deliver she needs money.  Thanks to the loan from the institution, however, she'll be able to deliver her embroidery on time.\r\n\r\nJulia's goal is for her son to finish his professional program so he can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe members are Antonia, Marcelina, and Julia, who also make a living in embroidery.  They comment that this is what they do most in their community because often their handiwork is bought as wedding mementos.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1248182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Rosa lives in her own house along with her husband and her three unmarried children. \r\n\r\nShe makes a living selling cosmetics, perfumes, and female beauty products. Each day she goes out to visit different friends, neighbors, and family members with the hope of selling a perfume, talcum powder, or body cream. Sometimes she also receives customers in her home, since she has a wide glass case where she displays her products for sale. Rosa has been selling cosmetics for nine years. She enjoys working independently without the pressure of working under another person. In addition to these sales, she hopes to begin selling juice and empanadas as well. Over the years in this business, she has learned a lot and developed some of her own sales techniques. \r\n\r\nRosa is very thankful for how well life has been going for her and knows that she must work hard in order to be successful.

She lives along with her husband and children in her own home where every day they share the happiness of progressing and improving their living conditions.\r\n\r\nRosmery\u2019s work consists of food sales. She goes to the market very early in search of the best ingredients since she likes to provide the best to her customers. Once she has all of the ingredients selected by her magic hands, she begins to prepare the dishes that she will offer to her distinguished clientele. When she finishes her preparations, she brings it all to the city\u2019s sawmill where she begins to sell. She works only by request since her exquisite flavor means that she has many customers.\r\n\r\nShe began selling one year ago since she had the need to contribute economically to the home. She is very happy with her work because she generates her own source of work. She does it alone and it gives her time to relax peacefully and provides her the necessary time with her family. \r\nShe has many plans for her future. Among those is to establish a restaurant in order to not have to be going to distant places to sell, but she knows that for this she needs to count on the economic capital necessary. For this she will work hard to put together and consolidate her project.\r\n\r\nThis is loan number 3 with MFP. She is very excited and thankful for the economic backing that they offer her to continue with her plans. She does not want to quit paying because of lack of money, and it is because of this that she promises to be very punctual and above all very responsible. She is very happy to continue with this group since they are very thoughtful and kind.\r\n\r\n With the amount requested of 1800 soles, she will buy ingredients and consumables in order to continue with her work, such as rice, condiments, meats, and others, as well as some vegetables and non-perishable products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1248259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, condiments, meats, and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-04T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-03T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":278.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":272.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":296.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":308.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":313.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":330.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.43,"local_amount":278.82,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":279.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188991},{"amount":105.9,"local_amount":272.32,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":273.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572892},{"amount":115.48,"local_amount":296.94,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":297.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122543},{"amount":119.78,"local_amount":308.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":308.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868372},{"amount":121.87,"local_amount":313.37,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":314.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577203},{"amount":128.54,"local_amount":330.53,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":331.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529444}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T00:31:18Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":503408,"name":"Ruseli","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruseli, de 41 a\u00f1os, es una mujer amable y muy responsable, esta casada con Alfredo y tiene 3 hijos de 21, 17 y 8 a\u00f1os de edad respectivamente, tiene su casa propia que pudo comprar junto a su esposo y ah\u00ed comparten el mismo deseo por salir adelante y forjarse un mejor nivel de vida.\nEl trabajo de Ruseli consiste en la venta de abarrotes al por menor, es decir compra los productos en grandes cantidades y de ah\u00ed se encarga de venderlos al menudeo.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Lydia replied 'It will be easier to graze the animals since the land will be fenced.'\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Lydia owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

He has an income from his father\u2019s business. So, Suren decided to start-up his own business. He has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start the business, but he hasn't had any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his lack of experience, which local credit providers usually demand. Suren plans to set up meat store locally. \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved under the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Suren will purchase refrigerators, a mincing-machine and a truck for meat transportation. He will also use the loan to purchase a stock of meat. He has already renovated the store in the town centre. The place is profitable as it is populous, and it does not have a meat store nearby. This will increase sales volume. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of Suren's

She lives in her own home. Sylvia's work is designing, making and selling clothing for ladies, men and children.\r\n\r\nShe does this work at a shop inside her home and has been doing this for five years. She says that she started in this business because of the need to obtain employment, and as she had studied industrial dressmaking, she decided to set up her business. \r\n\r\nShe considers it profitable because companies request her services for making employee uniforms. She also sells her merchandise to friends, family members and neighbors. Before she started this business, her husband took care of the household expenses. To support her husband, she decided to move forward and and put into practice what she had studied.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to keep her business going, because it provides good earnings and she can pay her household expenses. Therefore, this will be her first loan with the Yehu Microfinance institution. She feels very grateful to the institution for giving her the chance to belong to a group where they support one another. This motivates her to continue being on time with her installment payments.\r\n\r\nWith the KES 25,000, she will buy material such as fabric, lace, elastic and thread, so that she can continue making clothing and finish the number of orders placed with her for the coming

He does all relevant agricultural work to ensure a good quality harvest. The harvested products are sold locally.  He also has six pigs and a milk cow, whose milk is used in dairy products. \r\n\r\nDimitri is requesting a loan for the start-up of an agricultural business. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, Dimitri will purchase a tractor. He will perform agricultural work with the tractor on the lands of nearby farmers, mainly on tilling and sowing seasons and will be paid by landlords.

She is divorced and has 2 children. She works in a hospital as a nurse in the emergency surgery unit. She is very hard-working, and her colleagues like and respect her. Feruza has always wanted her children to become good, well-qualified workers who can serve their motherland and people. With this goal in mind, she made it possible for her sons to enter university. Currently, her eldest son is in his 3rd year of economics studies at the Russian-Tajik University, and her younger son is in his first year at the Tajikistan State University of Commerce where he is specializing in the customs-related field. Feruza's salary is not sufficient for her to cover the costs of her children's education, and for this reason, she is seeking a loan to pay for their studies. Her hopes are only on you. Let's cooperate to help this caring mother so her children can continue their university education.

and has 2 children. Her life circumstances are tough: her husband has gone to the Russian Federation but is unable send enough money home to provide for the children. Dilorom urgently needs to find a source of income, and for this reason, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead,\" which was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she received a certificate.

She has 9 children, a fact that earned her the title of \"Mother Heroine\" which was awarded to mothers of large families. She is a calm, kind-hearted and hard-working woman by nature. As the main breadwinner of the family, 17 years ago she began to work in animal husbandry, starting her business with a sum of only 15,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Thanks to Gulkan's hard work and the help of her children, her farm now includes 2 cows and their calves, 15 sheep and 2 horses, and brings in a monthly income of around 12,000 Som from the sale of milk. For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulkan has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 95,000 Som (KGS) to buy more head of livestock. She plans to use part of the income generated by this loan to expand her farm, and she also dreams of purchasing electrical appliances for her house.

the mother of five children. During the Soviet  times, she used to grow produce at a collective farm. As an additional source of income for her family, five years ago she started raising livestock, having launched her business with the starting capital of 80,000 KGS. Thanks to Roza\u2019s hard work, she now has a very developed farm, with a large livestock headcount and a car. Every month,  she earns about 4,000 KGS only from the sales of dairy products.
