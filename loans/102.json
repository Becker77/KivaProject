It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The older, Carla, is 32 years old; she works and helps out with the household expenses.  The younger, Helen, is 20 years old and in her 4th year of Systems Engineering studies at the UPONIC University in Juigalpa.  Antonia works as a janitor, and she rents a small room to live in with her daughters.  Thanks to a project with INVUR and the city, she has managed to build her own home, which consists of only one room and a small living room.  She hopes to continue to benefit from Kiva to finish construction on an addition that will serve as a kitchen and an additional room.  With the previous loan she was able to buy metal and glass windows, and add gates.  Her main dream is to be able to finish her little house and live in it with her daughters.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Most of the residents here run various businesses such as the manufacture of ivory palm buttons, other crafts, and general trading.\r\n\r\nJohanna is 26 years old and has been married for 9 years. She and her husband have three children who are all in school. Her husband works in the fields, working when there is work; sometimes he goes a long time without work.\r\n\r\nJohanna has a lathe (a machine for cutting ivory palm) for roughly manufacturing buttons, a product that is delivered to merchants in Manta. She works about six hours a day, Monday to Friday, often by herself and sometimes with help from her husband when he is unemployed. She is going to buy the raw materials in the country, because she says it is cheaper to buy it from the growers, and this will provide greater earnings.\r\n\r\nJohanna will use this loan to buy raw materials. She wants to increase her production to take advantage of the good market prices for her product. This is her second cycle in the Bank, and she likes it because they do not request so many papers for giving out loans.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to provide a good education for her young children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel McRoberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":601580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing ivory palm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-09-17T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johanna Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407457},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407458},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388598},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388599},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388600},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682930},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422054},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195840857},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":45.87,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283355}],"funded_date":"2010-09-18T02:39:58Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel McRoberts","image":602385}},{"id":235894,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This Kiva borrower is a 38-year-old married man and the father of three school-aged children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi.  The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 29-year-old Salome M. from Mbozi. She is married with two children, ages 4 and 6. Salome has been running a retail shop business since 2007.

Salome currently earns about $250 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase shop items in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to improve the quality and range of products in her \"duka.\" Salome thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":368633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase shop items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-13T06:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salome A.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She considers herself to be a very hardworking and multifaceted person, as she has been working in all types of businesses for the past four years depending on the season.  She now works selling gelatin by foot, while her husband has a business distributing peeled and diced potatoes to restaurants.  However, in order to have more income, she set up a guinea pig farm six months ago, where she raises them and sells them when they reach the right weight.  The meat merchants in the area are her main buyers.  She considers this business to be very profitable and thanks to it, she is getting the financial stability that her family needs.

Boimahmad, who is married and has four children. He is 42 years old and lives in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where he runs a retail shop with which he supports his family. In his shop, Boimahmad sells spare parts for many different types of foreign cars. He has worked in this business for more than five years. He hopes to increase his income and send his older son to university. To do this, he needs a loan for $1,900 to buy more spare parts and enlarge his shop to better meet the needs of his customers. The loan will be repaid within 10 months. Boimahmad is happy to be able to apply for this loan and would like to thank everyone for this trust. Hr promises to be precise in making loan payments. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business plan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 47 years old and a widow with four children. To make a living she has to raise cattle. Because it is a very difficult activity for a woman, she gets help from her relatives. At the beginning, she did not have any idea how to keep and look after cattle. However, being a smart woman and having caring relatives, she quickly learned the necessary aspects and developed good skills. Now she has three sheep and wants to increase their number. \r\n\r\nHer plan is to achieve the desired population step by step. First, she hopes to obtain a loan and buy one calf. After feeding and resale, she is going to buy two calves for fattening and resale again and so on. Constant concern about her children\u2019s future and awareness that there is nobody except her to take care of them, strengthens her determination and makes her steadfast. One of her future plans is to build a new house for her children. \r\n\r\nBatima has three partners, Aina, Chynarkul and Zeinep. Aina, age 43, is married. Her husband works as a farmer. They keep twenty sheep at home and Aina has to look after them in addition to doing her duties. Aina wants to buy ten more sheep and thus increase their population. She hopes to do that by obtaining a loan.\r\n\r\nChynarkul, 52, is a widow. All three of her children are adults. To keep herself busy, she decided to undertake cattle breeding. Currently she has three calves and hopes to get a loan to buy two more. \r\n\r\nZeinep is the youngest partner. She is just twenty-one years old. She is married and has six-month old daughter. Being a housewife, Zeinep\u2019s needs a refridgerator, becaue it is summer and everything spoils very quickly. She hopes that, after getting a loan, she will finally be able to buy a new refridgerator.    \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":388041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase shop items in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T09:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tumaini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023047},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868288},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757484},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146578},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984723},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015396}],"funded_date":"2009-09-14T16:22:32Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":140897,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen is married with 4 children and she is 50 years old.

G. is 50 years old and lives in the Pablo Calero neighborhood with his wife, who works as a merchant.  They support one another with the household expenses.  Don Francisco has 5 children who are all married.  One of his grandsons helps him with the farmwork.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the past 30 years, Don Francisco has been engaged in agriculture.  Through his hard work, he was able to buy his own land for the purpose of growing crops.  He thanks AFODENIC for providing him with his tenth loan, which he will use to purchase fertilizers so that he can produce a better crop.  The income he generates at harvest time has enabled him to improve his living conditions.  The low interest rates and easy payments have also been a great benefit.

They are able to buy each sack of rice for 21 dollars and sell the rice in smaller increments for a total of 40 dollars per sack. \r\n\r\nMs. G. is requesting a loan in order to buy more sacks of rice.

Occidental. She is 65 years old but is still strong enough to manage her business. Her husband, Orlando, oversees their rice farm but cannot do it full-time because he previously suffered a stroke. The couple has seven adult children who also help them with their household needs. Merceditha wants her business to continue so they can have a comfortable way of living and save for their future. \r\n<br>To help her husband provide in preparation for their children's college education, Merceditha began a general store business. She started with a small store adjacent to her house and earned a small income, which was a big help in sustaining her family's needs, especially her children's. As time went on, she wanted to earn more by expanding their general store.\r\n<br>When Merceditha decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, she knew that the loan she got for her general  store would help her tremendously in increasing her income. She was able to buy new products to sell and set up a coffee shop within her store. As her loans continued, she purchased and managed fishponds that helped her with her other needs. The successive loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon brought comfort to Merceditha's family for the help they were to her businesses, and she now earns 14,000 PHP a month.\r\n<br>Her previous loan of 23,000 PHP was paid in full and on time within her loan term. Now, Merceditha is borrowing 26,000 PHP as additional working capital for her general store and fishponds.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project  <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <i>honorable<\/i>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> \u2013 a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard

She tells us that she used to sell outside of a street market.  Twenty years ago she had to opportunity to start selling her product at a stall located inside of the market.  This increased her sales.\r\n\r\nHer youngest child currently helps her get ahead in her business.  Very early everyday he goes to the fishing terminal in the city of Trujillo and buys the fish they will sell during the day.  Marcelina sells her merchandise until midday, and then she heads home.  This activity has helped her get ahead and to work for her children\u2019s progress.  She was widowed 20 years ago, and she had to get them ahead by herself.\r\n\r\nDue to the increase in the price of fish in the area north of the country, she has seen the need to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan for 1,000 PEN.  She will use it to buy more fish to maintain her business.\r\n\r\nMarcelina is a very responsible woman who is devoted to her work.  She has worked with our institution previously, and she has demonstrated herself to be punctual and responsible with her payments.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":510347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy fish to expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Paijan - Ascope - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":151.06},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":161.03},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":163.64},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":168.54},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175.49},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":180.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.87,"local_amount":151.06,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":151.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662339},{"amount":56.36,"local_amount":161.03,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":161.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695043},{"amount":57.28,"local_amount":163.64,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":163.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878088},{"amount":58.98,"local_amount":168.54,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":168.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618115},{"amount":61.43,"local_amount":175.49,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":175.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832517},{"amount":63.08,"local_amount":180.24,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":180.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099122}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T10:29:58Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":190861,"name":"Iyabo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iyabo is a hardworking woman and she is determined to pull her business and family out of poverty.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Caradio-an, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  Sugarcane plantation, rice field and fish selling businesses.  Her husband Simeon P., who is 34 years old, works as a Laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 7 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\nMelinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 which she intends to use as additional capital in her fish vending and to purchase fertilizer for her farm so that she could continue to save up for future house repairs and her children's education. \r\n\r\nMelinda P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Manapla, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Ernesto, who is 52 years old, works as an Inkarkado\/supervisor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children who are 12 to 29 years old. Two of the children have their own families, three of them work to help her and two are currently going to school. Arcenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arcenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future for her family and for educational needs. Arcenia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The couple started this business with the purpose of having an additional source of income four years ago.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\n\nWith income from maize sales, Janerose will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing.\n\nIn 2012, the members of Temakho B group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\n\nThe photograph shows the members of the group.

Earning very little from his work, he is having a hard time supporting his family, his wife having neither job skills nor money to open a small retail business.<p>\r\n\r\nIn order to increase his earnings, he is asking for a loan of $950 which will permit him to restock his shoe business in such materials as leather, soles, buckles, and even to buy some machines to make his work easier.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

H., 46, was born in Cartagena de Indias, a colonial and touristic city in the Latin Caribbean. It has a sunny climate beaches with warm waters, and is located in the extreme northeast of Colombia. Norbertina has a 19-year-old son, and lives in the Los Calamares neighborhood in the southwest of Cartagena. Here, the proliferation of enterprising businesses, the happiness of the residents, and the fulfillment of their credit obligations are the common denominators. For this reason, the support of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo is well known in the area.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age, Norbertina has been very enterprising. Her parents with great effort managed to provide her with a primary education. She then continued on her own with secondary school education and a career as an office technician. This experience taught her the importance of education, and she now directs all her efforts toward providing a university education for her son.\r\n\r\nWhen Norbertina concluded her technical career, she thought it might be more profitable to work independently, so started a business selling general merchandise. She began as a low-volume business, as her income did not permit her to buy in large quantities. She gradually built up her working capital and her customer base in the market until she was generating enough income to support her household.\r\n\r\nNorbertina felt she needed a strong push to generate more growth. At this point, she approached la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo who helped her with working capital and business training. Her first loan, in 1994, was for $110,000 COP, and since then she has added 25 more individual loans to her working capital.\r\n\r\nLike all persistent entrepreneurs, Norbertina says that it was difficult starting out from zero and she invested much time and effort to finding customers for her products. At the same time, she had the parallel responsibility of her home and son, as her husband works outside the city in the office of an ironworks. \r\n\r\nNow, her reality has changed. She says, \u201cMy family environment and my income have improved notably. I am thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With them, I have found the opportunity to work independently and to study a technical career. My advisors have been very special, and I have managed to pay for my son\u2019s university studies.\u201d\r\n\r\nNorbertina dreams of continuing to advance her son\u2019s education and of becoming a micro-business leader in the development of projects for other entrepreneurs. She would like to give back to society and the Foundation part of the benefits she has received. \r\n\r\nNorbertina would like to expand her business to all of the city of Cartagena and even other cities in Colombia, becoming a wholesale distributor of imported goods. She wants to generate enough income to maintain her home in the best possible condition.\r\n\r\nThis loan, for $1,200,000 COP will pay part of a semester\u2019s tuition for her son, who is in his sixth semester in the field of public accounting. The hopes of bettering the quality of life for the family are with him.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":473398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"University education for her son","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-01-21T14:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norbertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":189827},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":194991},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":198241},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":201545},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":204904},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":210492}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.87},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.97},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.72},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98.87,"local_amount":189827,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":194523.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913406},{"amount":101.56,"local_amount":194991,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":199815,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949012},{"amount":103.25,"local_amount":198241,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":203145.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677805},{"amount":104.97,"local_amount":201545,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":206531.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712177},{"amount":216.35,"local_amount":415396,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":425672.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895683}],"funded_date":"2010-01-21T15:25:58Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":174005,"name":"Karim","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0438\u0440\u0437\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0410. \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043c\u0438. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 47 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0437\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043c \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 16 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442. \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0437\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.

She is on her fifth loan, aged 42 and married. She is the mother of 10 children, among whom six are enrolled in school and three others are not because she can't pay school fees. Her husband has a little job working as a driver for an individual. \r\n\r\nAmani started up her little business selling charcoal with her own funds, received from her husband, in the amount of about 10 USD. Her business consists in selling charcoal in a little market located in the urban\/rural zone of Ndosho, 12 km from the center of the town of Goma. It must be noted that before opening this business, Amani had already begun selling tomatoes on a small scale. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from the MFI Hekima, Amani hopes to increase her turnover by buying six sacks of charcoal and 4 baskets of tomatoes. In future, she plans to buy planks to further the construction of her house and to be able to pay school fees easily for her children. She thanks Hekima for the loans that she has received without any tangible collateral, since thanks to those loans she has already bought 85 planks and 25 tin roofing panels which she will be using in building her house. \r\n\r\nThe \"Promesse\" group is composed of six members who are all women. Behind the group you can see stones from the Nyiragongo volcano. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":510458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"6 sacks of charcoal and 4 baskets of tomatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Iris).  She started when she was 24 along with her husband who had experience from his family in raising cattle.\r\nThey bought cows to fatten up and that meant that the cows weren\u2019t well-fed: they nourished them with grasses from the Sierra, and balanced food so that they could later sell them when they were fatter in the center of the city.  Some months ago they had a problem with grass scarcity in the Sierra because of the lack of rain.  The first loan that she received was to buy more dairy cows.  The milk that the animals produce is sold in the markets where it is used especially to make cheese.  In the past they wasted a lot because of having to transport the cattle to the markets in the capital.  Currently this has changed since they are the producers; they have their regular customers in the capital and these buyers sell it in the markets.  The cattle business served to educate their children who are today professionals and now they are able to support their parents.  It is wonderful for Benilda and her husband to have succeeded and they have also improved their house.  This loan will be used to buy Ciclozona, an effective medicine that helps debug the cows and also to avoid infection, colds and fevers when they travel into cooler temperatures.\r\n<br

It is a symbol of the region along with other symbols which characterize the town of Aculco which is considered a \u201cPueblo M\u00e1gico\u201d (Magic Town).

She has one child and has been selling tortillas for 7 years.  She is requesting this loan to buy corn at a lower price because during this harvest season in the region, the price of corn falls.  It is a strategy which she has used in the past and it has had good results.\r\n\r\nHer customers believe that Aurelia's product is good and has that special touch.  This is why they consume her product.  Aurelia delivers to people's homes in neighboring communities.  She also has customers in the State of Queretaro (who consume her product every week) and in the State of Puebla (who consume her product every fortnight).  Aurelia started selling tortillas from her home, delivering her product on a bicycle.  Through a lot of hard work she managed to buy a vehicle 5 years ago which has helped her a lot with her deliveries.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of requesting her loan, Aurelia feels sure that she can get ahead in life with the moral support of her fellow group members.

store. She lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari-sari store, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. \r\n\r\nEmma is borrowing PHP 9,000 so that she can purchase more inventory to sell. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Emma aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She enjoys her life being a farmer\u2019s wife and has raised three children. Now she is 56 years old, and her eldest son and daughter are both married and live on their own. Only her twenty-year-old daughter, a college student, lives with them. Apart from farming and growing various things in the field, among all the pleasures of life in a rural area there is one that rewards her financially: selling milk.  Azykbubu\u2019s daily milk sales constitute around ten liters, which earns her about $55 a month. \r\n<p>\r\nNo matter how \u201cimperceptible\u201d the gift looks, Azykbubu still remembers with delight and gratitude the day when her parents\u2013in-law gave her one cow and three sheep as a present. Since that day she and her husband have been breeding cows. The profits from this venture have allowed them to buy tractors, provide for their children\u2019s education and increase their herd. \r\n<p>\r\nNow, Azykbubu needs a loan to buy another cow. This would help her increase the size of her herd and the amount of milk she could sell. Azykbubu\u2019s main goals are to give her daughter an education, marry her off and increase the population of her herd.\r\n<p>\r\nAzykbubu has three partners: Satybek, Kaldykul and Burulcha.\r\n<p>\r\nSatybek, 52, is married.

Fabrica, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She is engaged in food vending as a source of daily income and raises pigs on the side as a supplement. Her husband Welfredo works as a carpenter. They are blessed with two children who are 15 and 20 years old and still going to school. The younger is in high school and the older attends college. It is Piladel's dream for her children to finish their studies and have a stable income from gainful employment or a stable livelihood, so that they will have a more comfortable life ahead of them.\r\n\r\nShe thought of going into business to augment her husband's income because she knew that her husband's work could be seasonal at times. And if they relied on only one source of income, she would not be able to fulfill her dreams for her children and their family. At first, she only raised pigs in her backyard, but the return on her investment took 3-4 months to pay off, so she decided to engage in food vending so that she would have a daily income. As her business continued to flourish, she soon needed additional capital to sustain her business operations.\r\n\r\nThis is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002. Her loans contributed a lot to increasing their income capacity by allowing them to raise more pigs and increase the variety of food that she sold. Now her minimum monthly income has increased to PHP 2,000 from her food vending operations. And her income from selling the pigs helps to pay for her children's education and provides additional income for their business.\r\n\r\nPiladel's previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used as additional working capital for her business. It was fully paid within her loan term without delay. Now she is borrowing her 15th loan in the same amount, PHP 19,500 to be used as additional capital for her pig fattening and food vending businesses. Some of the income will be set aside for her children\u2019s education and to pay for their family expenses. The rest will be plowed back as capital for their business operations.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":434572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Additional

She gets up very early to prepare the delicious pastries she sells daily to her community. With alacrity she immediately prepares breakfast for her children to send them off to school. She has had her business for five years. Her pastries are delicious and highly popular. But the activity which brings her the most earnings is the sale of Firewood. Melinda buys a lot of 100 trees which she cuts up with the help of laborers after which she sells them wholesale to the merchants who come to her home on weekends. She enjoys the sale of firewood very much. \"It doesn't take much work and is more profitable\" she states. In the future she would like to set up a small workshop where she could make benches, desks, furniture and other products. This is her ninth loan with MFP and as always she is sure her community bank will support her continued growth. With this loan she plans to invest in the purchase of a lot of 200 trees with which she will be able to supply the demand for firewood in her area. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":610648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 200 trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-07T03:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718180}],"funded_date":"2010-10-07T18:18:51Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":240063,"name":"Francois Xavier","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francois Xavier is 29 years old.

She runs a general store which she began 11 years ago when she lived in another suburb in the south of Barranquilla. Two years after she set up her business, Nancy moved to Malambo, taking advantage of the fact that her sister ran a well-known store in the area. It was actually her sister who recommended that Nancy join the Mario Santo Domingo foundation, as her growing client base wanted new products and her working capital wasn't enough to meet her customer's demands.  With the loans she obtained Nancy was able to keep her store continually stocked up with a diverse range of products for the home, which is still the case today. In spite of the challenges she has faced, Nancy has always been able to get ahead with the unconditional help of her children. Nancy accepts cash and credit payments from her customers who live locally in her area, which sees a lot of business. \r\n\r\nThis Kiva credit will be the third loan that Nancy has taken out with the Mario Santo Domingo foundation. With this loan she will buy stationery items for the home as well as clothing accessories. This investment is destined for success as it has been planned at a time when sales traditionally pick up around the Day of Love and Friendship, which is celebrated during the months of August and September.  \r\n\r\nNancy dreams of expanding her business, which is why she has her heart set on achieving sales goals in her general store.

She went into business in order to help raise her four children: Armando (19) is at university; Uriel (14) is attending secondary school; Luis (7) is in primary school; Marlen (5) is in pre-school. Martha's goal is to give them a good education and help her husband with the household expenses since his salary often isn't enough. \r\n\r\nShe started up in October 2001, selling just soft drinks and sweets. Later she started selling sandwiches and brand-name bread. Since she was doing well, she set up a store in the front of her house where she sells a broad range of products. She has been very successful since then. Some months ago, she started making tamales on weekends. \r\n\r\nShe needs a loan of 7,000 MXN, which she will repay in six months, to buy merchandise and re-stock her store, so as to have more and

There were many difficult days when he started as an assistant in the convenience store.  Later, he was promoted because of his work effort.  He has been happy because his income improved.  He got married, and he and his wife have a daughter.  But, they live in his mother-in-law\u2019s house.  This is pretty uncomfortable because they do not have the privacy they would like.  Since he started working, he has been gathering money to make his own house.  His wish is to be able to have his own.  He was able to buy the land with his savings.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan he will start to buy construction materials to start building his house little by little.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
