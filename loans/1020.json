All of the family members work hard, but the income is not enough for covering the everyday expenses. So, John decided to start up a new business. He has requested loans from his local financial institutions several times without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country, rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, John will build a greenhouse. He will purchase building materials and construct it. John will plant tomatoes and cabbage seeds in his greenhouse and sell the harvested products locally. This will increase his income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Her loan request was rejected because of her low income and insufficient experience in her business. However, her loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The program provides start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor. These people do not have access to traditional credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Lela requested a loan to start up a massage room.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 20 years old, not married and lives with her parents. Her parents could not afford to send her to a university, so she has completed a sewing class and learned how to sew traditional women's dresses. Now Mavtuna wants to become a successful business woman and earn income from her craft. She has received a certificate for completing the \"Get Ahead\" course offered by the National Association of Business Women. She can now start a business and become successful in this field. She wants to offer sewing services, because she has experience in this kind of business. Her sewing shop will be close to her house, and her neighbors have already promised to be regular customers since her work is very neat and beautiful. She plans to use her earnings to help parents improve their living conditions. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 Somoni to buy a sewing machine and materials to establish a new business. She's waiting for your

She lives with her parents in a rural district. She is charismatic and earnest. She supports her parents by working in the fields. Two years ago, she inherited a plot of land where she grows potatoes, lima beans, peas and corn. Once she started, she realized that a product is more lucrative when a larger quantity is harvested, so this year she grew potatoes, which she sold with success. This time she wants to plant corn and flowers because the climate and the month is right for good products and profits. Meanwhile, she also makes a living caring for livestock. For example, she sells milk and cheeses that she makes. Merlinia is constant in her activities and is requesting a loan to help her acquire more fertilizer to start planting corn and flowers.

She is a businesswoman of good repute and has run a cloth stitching business for 5 years. She buys cloth of different colors from the market and stitches it to make bed sheets and trousers for the people of her community. She started this business with the motive to help her husband in order to overcome financial problems, and now she is in a situation to further increase her business.

So, Slava decided to start a new business. He has requested loans from his local financial institutions several times without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country, rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, Slava will build a greenhouse. He will purchase building materials and construct it. Slava will plant different kinds of vegetables seeds in his greenhouse and sell the harvested products locally. This will increase his income.

She is married to Johnny, a cook, and is a mother to her children.  Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nErlinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is a place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Php-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales everyday.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a Php 25,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nErlinda hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1248490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He will use the loan to buy motorcycle parts for the maintenance of his tricycle unit. He has to maintain his unit in good condition in order to have a regular income for the daily needs of his family. \r\n\r\nAriel hopes to have a good life.

He has requested loans from his local financial institutions several times without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and a lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, Tamaz will cultivate a hectare agricultural land and sow cucumbers and peppers which will increase his income.

She is very motivated and has always wanted to do something to help improve her family situation. \r\nHer husband, a driver, had been the sole earner of the family, and it had been difficult to cover all household expenses from his income alone, so Saeedan took initiative and started a clothes retailing business. She purchases clothes in various designs and colors from the market at wholesale prices to sell to people in her community. She knows the tastes of her customers very well.\r\n\r\nShe is a mother of five, four of whom are attending school currently.

She has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was always rejected, due to lack of experience in a new business. Experience is usually demanded by local credit providers. Manana requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with easier conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Manana will purchase used clothing and sell it from her house among her neighbors. She will begin her entrepreneurial activity with a wide assortment of merchandise and high sales volume. This will increase the family's income. She wants to develop her business further and reinvest the increased income in trading. The new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

But when this happens she immediately takes them to the veterinarian and they recover easily. Mago says \"my goal is to finish building my house so that my children can have a dignified home, but I would also love for them to have successful careers and stable lives without economic struggles.\" For this reason Mago works raising sheep to add one more income to the family. \r\n\r\nGroup members Ren\u00e9 and Roberto will invest their loans in their grocery stores.

Do\u00f1a Luisa is her group representative and has been working with the institution for three loan cycles, in which she has requested loans to buy more sheep. This time, she is not sure how many sheep she will buy because she also needs to buy their feed, since even though she lets them graze in the afternoons sometimes that's not enough. She has been raising sheep for the last six years so that she can help out with household expenses, since for Do\u00f1a Luisa it is very important for her children to study and become professionally accomplished; her goal is for her children to have a better quality of life. Do\u00f1a Luisa's challenge is that she lacks money to fix her sheep pen so that they don't get sick very often, since if they get sick they could die and that would mean a loss of income. Do\u00f1a Luisa is very happy with the loan she received from the institution, just like the other group members: Do\u00f1a Juana, Guadalupe, Eteresa and Elodia will buy more chickens, while Do\u00f1a Pilar, Tomasa and Antonia are requesting their loans to buy more sheep, and Do\u00f1a Herlinda will restock her small grocery store. \r\n."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":1246734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy canned goods, milk, bread, eggs, and other products.

In winter, the ice cream business is quite good, so his family decided to buy a large amount of ice cream from Russia.

approached MDO Arvand for a loan to increase her herd of cattle. She keeps several head of livestock at home, and this is the main livelihood in the region where she lives. Fattening cattle is her sole source of income. This type of work is currently in demand, which is why her family is working hard at it, so they can support themselves in this way. They have a large family and there is not enough employment for everyone in the village where they live. Many villagers have to go to the Russian Federation to earn money as migrant workers, but Fotima does not want to send any of her family to a foreign country so she is trying to provide for them herself. For this reason, Fotima wants to get a loan from Arvand to buy several head of cattle to continue to develop her business.

She's married and has four children.  Her husband, Davlatali, is a very kind person but he is not able to provide his wife and children with necessities, especially as the children grow and require more.  Rajabgul lived in poverty many years and it was difficult.  With the goal of improving her quality of life, she started her own business sewing women's dresses.  She has a very old sewing machine which breaks frequently and doesn't stitch very well.  Because of this, she has few clients and can't grow her business.  She's planning to buy a new sewing machine to help her new business grow.  She is asking for 500 somonis to buy the machine.  With her revenue, she plans to provide her children with an education and nutritious food.  She awaits your

They live in a quiet community where the majority of people earn their living growing corn.  They selected the group's name from among a number of options; it was the one they liked best.  Lucero, one of the members, tells us that she's thirty-three, and has been married to Zeferino for several years, and together they have two children who are in school.  \r\n\r\nLucero says that, although she was born elsewhere, she came to live in this community. She makes her living raising and selling calves.  She buys them when they are small, raises and cares for them very well, giving them the food they need like corn and feed.  But she often needs to give them vitamins so they don't get sick and die.  She has been in business for seven years, having started out when she came to live with her in-laws.  She loved milking the cows, which she had learned while living with her parents.  Then, thanks to the first loan she received from the Institution, she decided to buy her first calf.  Although her in-laws had sheep, she didn't pay much attention because it was her dream to have calves.\r\n\r\nShe says, \"I really love cows and milking.  However, the hard part is when they get sick and oftentimes don't recover, and die.  It's an enormous loss of income, and I would like to get some kind of training so I can care for my animals better.\"  Difficulties aside, Lucero wants the business to keep growing so she can improve the corral; if the cow are doing well they'll produce.  Lucero is hoping that this will provide good security for her and her husband in their old age, and that their children will get professional degrees so they can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nOther members of the group have their own businesses, just like Lucero:  Ana Lilia and Vanessa will invest in their grocery store; Francisca and Roc\u00edo will invest in candy; Aurelia will buy sheep; Elena will invest in clothing and shoes; Josefina will buy chickens; and Margarita will buy bulls.  All the women in the group have a great desire make their families succeed.  They are very grateful to the Institution and to Kiva for the loan because it has been a big help in allowing them to improve their families' quality of life.

Do\u00f1a Juana who is the representative of the group is 46 years old and is married to se\u00f1or Fidencio.  Together for several years, they have a family, but currently do not have dependents.  \n\nDo\u00f1a Juana sells plastics such as fibers, buckets, and tubs as well as other things.  She started her business 12 years ago because she enjoys working.  Her goal when she began was to have a business in which she herself would administer her time, where she could open and close at the hour she wanted.  This time Do\u00f1a Juana is applying for the loan to buy more merchandise.  She is very happy and grateful for the loans from Visionfund and Kiva \"...because my business has been able to pick up and grow little by little.\"  Do\u00f1a Juana is a great person.  The only thing she desires is to ensure her quality of life for when she is no longer able to work.\n\nThe rest of the group also have their different business activities.

Together with her husband, she manages the household and runs the familiy business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMa. Teresa runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Yolanda\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked on a table or mat. Some special items are displayed in hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people buy their clothes used from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper than brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, Ma. Teresa is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan to buy additional stock of used, yet high-quality, clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. So, she plans to add more pants and jeans, as well as used bags and footwear. If she can continue the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nMa. Teresa hopes to give her children a good future and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This group is also a place where she can draw strength and inspiration from studying the word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1248393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional stock of used-but-quality clothes needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T03:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T03:10:05Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

Do\u00f1a Claudia, una de las integrantes, tiene 54 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Francisco desde hace 35 a\u00f1os y juntos han formado una familia con nueve hijos solo tres de ellos aun dependen de Do\u00f1a Claudia y Don Francisco. Do\u00f1a Claudia se dedica a la cr\u00eda y engorda de vacas lecheras, las compra desde peque\u00f1as las crece y engorda cuando ya est\u00e1n bien para que sean pre\u00f1adas por un buey macho hace que sus vacas sean pre\u00f1adas para que cuando nazca el becerro la vaca produzca leche, esta vez Do\u00f1a Claudia esta solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comprar una vaca lechera y su alimento Do\u00f1a Claudia platica que desde hace 30 a\u00f1os inicio con la crianza de sus vacas y la inicio porque quer\u00eda apoyar con los gastos del hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.

Las integrantes del grupo tambi\u00e9n desean superarse es por eso que est\u00e1n solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para invertirle en sus actividades productivas como las se\u00f1oras Raquel y Maribel compraran cerdos para cria. Nieves, Paula y Karina compraran borregos para cria y su venta, Esther comprara becerros para su cria y engorda para su venta, Carmen invertir\u00e1 en su tienda de abarrotes, Ariana invertir\u00e1 en bisuter\u00eda y Felisa comprara guajolotes para cria y venta. El grupo esta muy contento y agradecido con la instituci\u00f3n por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado y que para estas mujeres a sido de gran ayuda para mejorar la calidad de vida de nuestros clientes.","en":"The \u201cLas Mazahuas\u201d group has worked together for many years with the communal bank and comprises women who have always tried to give their families the best. Their group name was chosen because the mother tongue of many of the women is mazua. One of the members is Claudia, who is 54 and has been married to Francisco for 35 years. Together, they form a family with their 9 children, 3 of which still depend on Claudia and Francisco. Claudia breeds and fattens dairy cows: she buys them as calves, raises them and fattens them up; once they're ready for breeding, they mate with a bull; and when the calf is born, the cow will produce milk. This time Claudia is requesting a loan to buy a cow and cattle feed. Claudia says she started breeding cattle 30 years ago and she initiated this business in order to help out with the household expenses and the education of her children. Claudia comments, \"since I was little, I enjoyed watching the birth of calves\". Claudia's difficulties are many, like lack of cattle feed that she can't afford to buy in large quantities, and the income she loses when a cow gets sick and dies. Despite all of this, Claudia is enthusiastic and hard working and that's exactly why her goal is to own many dairy cows that will produce big quantities that she can sell to more people, and eventually make cheese with her cows' milk. All of Claudia's earnings would be put toward supporting her daughters who are currently students and who want to finish their professional studies. Each of her daughters has a different dream. The other members of the group also hope to succeed and that's why they're requesting this loan. The loan will be invested in their businesses: Raquel and Maribel will buy pigs for breeding; Nieves, Paula and Karina will buy sheep for breeding and selling; Esther will buy calves for breeding, fattening up and selling; Carmen will invest in her grocery store; Ariana will invest in jewelry; and Felisa will buy turkey for breeding and selling. The group is very happy with and grateful to the communal bank, which has been a big help in improving their quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6125,"image":{"id":1246725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives with her partner Nicanor with whom she has 3 children.  She has her own house in which she spends her days alongside her partner and children, who are the reason for her efforts, work and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nMartha's work is the sale of cosmetic products and other merchandise like clothing and shoes, which change according to the season of the year.  She goes out each day in search of customers, most of whom are friends, neighbors and acquaintances.  She has been doing this job for 5 years and has always done it by herself.  When she began in this business, it didn't go very well because she was only waiting for customers to arrive at her house in search of her products.  This didn't work because she didn't sell the quantity that they wanted, but in time she learned that to have success in this type of work, she had to go out in search of customers and have convincing techniques in order to be able to sell sufficiently, to obtain good earnings and, above all, to maintain her position as their preferred vendor so that later on they would return to make new purchases from her.\r\n\r\nMartha hopes to continue working and to be successful in the future.  Right now she has many sales and this means that she has more income, which helps improve the living conditions that she wants to offer her family.  This is her fifth loan with the MFP institution.  Martha is grateful to the people that make her loan possible and who give her the opportunity to continue working to achieve her objectives.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCresencia hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work in her business.

people to gather up their strength and galvanize the resources they have on hand. Dilafruz is one such person who is trying to improve her living conditions and stimulate the economic situation of her family. She is married and has 3 children. Her husband earns a small salary that is not sufficient to provide for all the family's needs, so Dilafruz has decided to help him for the welfare of the family. To this end, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" that was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate. She now wants to start a business selling food items. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to provide her children with a good education and nutritious food. Dilafruz is seeking a loan of 2,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy inventory to set up her new business. She is waiting for your kindness.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1247995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

married, and has 3 children. She sells children's clothing, and has around 14 years of experience working in this field. This is the first time she has come to Arvand for a loan. She heard from her neighbours at her business that it is possible to get a loan from our organization to increase her turnover, and she immediately submitted an application. Her husband works transporting construction materials such as sand, stone, cement blocks, coal, and so on. He helps and supports his wife in every way he can. They worked together to host the weddings of both their son and their daughter. Azizahon plans to use the loan to buy a new assortment of children's clothing so she can increase her turnover, thereby earning more profit which will allow her to save money for her youngest son's future. Azizahon and her husband are grateful to our organization for the financial help and support.

She currently lives with her parents, her brother and her brother's family.  \r\n\r\nShe and her husband divorced eight years ago and, due to a combination of circumstances, Marhabo and her two children were left without any shelter or support.  For the past eight years, Marhabo has been saving some money and running a little shop where she prepares and sells \"pirozhki\" (baked or fried buns).  However, she doesn't have quite enough money to buy an apartment, and this is why she is asking for a loan.  Her parents are both retired, and she cannot expect them to help her. \r\n\r\nThe photo is taken in the apartment that Marhabo would like to buy.

Mirelem is not alone in his business; his wife helps him to choose products for sale because she has good taste. \r\n\r\nMirelem knows what his customers need and which products are in demand, and he wishes to expand his business. For this purpose, he applied for a loan of 2000 AZN. He will use it to purchase more goods for his shop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1249204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrical Goods","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more goods for his electrical goods store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Sabirabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.012778 48.478889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirelem ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":426.07,"local_amount":334.17,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":334.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339453436},{"amount":211.44,"local_amount":165.84,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":165.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347006439},{"amount":212.51,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:47:19Z","rounded_local_amount":166.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355748905},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":166.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364453245},{"amount":212.51,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":166.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372857524},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":166.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381626304},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":166.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390489711},{"amount":212.51,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":166.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399738234},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":166.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410008761},{"amount":212.51,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":166.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419772013},{"amount":212.45,"local_amount":166.63,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T09:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":166.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430004446}],"funded_date":"2013-01-04T14:05:08Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T09:56:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neil Garvin","image":835015}},{"id":503966,"name":"Ma.

He is requesting a loan for 50,000 KES from Juhudi kilimo to buy dairy goats so that he can earn extra income by selling their milk. This will help him educate his children and improve his livelihood, and also allow him to feed some of the milk to his children, because he believes this will help them to grow and be healthy. His goal for the next five years is to buy another one-acre piece of land. His main challenges are the high costs of feed and a lack of nearby customers to buy his products.\r\n

She used the previous loan to buy more cleaning supplies (chlorine, air fresheners, etc.)\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to Ceprodel and Kiva for giving her the opportunity and for putting their confidence in her.  The loans have enabled her to expand her business, improve her home and provide better living conditions for herself and her family.

","en":" Zamira is a young woman, the mother of four children. She works as a kindergarten teacher. Her husband provides for the family by taking out private work assignments as a building contractor. Since their family is young, Zamira would like to improve their living condition and buy missing items of furniture. Her salary doesn\u2019t allow saving money for such major purchases.

In 2010, they come together to stand united for one another and form this group. They belong to a non-tribal community living here in Manipur state on the outskirts of Imphal East district located in the North Eastern part of India. \r\n\r\nThe woman pictured with raised hand is called Ngoubi and is the profile representative of the group. She is 20 years old and is mother to a two-year-old son. She still shares the same kitchen with her in-laws but did not get any financial support. Her husband, 22 years old, is a seasonal farmer. In the off season, usually, sand sieving is his way of earning income for the family.\r\n\r\n In order to supplement their income, Ngoubi started her line of weaving activities. She uses a handloom to weave. (A sample handloom can be seen in the picture behind the members.)\r\n \r\nWith her first loan, Ngoubi was able to increase her production as compared to before the loan. The cloth that she weaves includes bed covers, wrap-  around skirts, and cloth usable for towels and shawls. She supplies her products at the market at reasonable rates. She is happy that she is in good health to support the family income. With the profit that she earns, she usually puts aside some amount to deposit in the group savings on a weekly basis. In this way every time she gets a loan, she has been able to increase her production. She is happy that from her business earnings, she helped her husband purchase a new shovel and a filter bar for his sand-sieving activities. She has been saving most of her profits as well as her husband's income for a separate home very soon.

He is married and has three children. Work in education requires much sacrifice and follow-through in teaching\/learning. Shuhratjon works as a teacher at a school teaching youngsters of various ages where he imparts knowledge with dignity. His main concern is educating these people since they are future of the nation and improving standards of living. \r\n\r\nHe likes his profession very much and works with pleasure but his salary is small and he can\u2019t buy all the necessary things for his family. His wife is a housewife and has no source of income. Also, Shuhratjon\u2019s parents live with him. They are pensioners. \r\n\r\nSo Shuhratjon is the only breadwinner in the family.

All of them are happily married and have children of their own. They belong to a non-tribal community living on the outskirts of Imphal East district of Manipur state in the North Eastern part of India. \r\n\r\nSandha is the profile member pictured with raised hand. She is 31 years old and is a mother to two sons of 12 years and seven years old. Her husband, 37 years old, is a seasonal farmer by trade. In order to supplement the family income, in her previous business she used to sell jewellery by visiting house to house. Bangles, necklaces, earrings, etc. were some of the items she sold. Being a housewife, it was never easy for her to continue with this jewellery business.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2010 and with her saved money, she started a clothes business. She sells ready-made garments--kids' wear, vests, socks, and face towels (locally woven). She did well with this business and at the same time she was able to lend a helping hand as is required of her as a mother. The second loan helped her to increase her store's stock of clothes to sell and also helped her to renovate her store by extending their porch into a store. She is happy that she is making progress in terms of her business which enhances her security for the future. Unlike what happened to herself and her husband, she wants to provide her children a good opportunity for their education.\r\n\r\nSandha now needs another loan for her business. She will use the loan to buy more kids' wear to sell. She will also buy kids' shoes to resell apart from the usual items that she has been selling. She has plans to expand her business and specialize in kids' products down the road.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too are making improvements like Sandha and needed loans for their respective income-generating activities. Sand sieving activities, piggery farming, and pottery are the primary activities of the group members.        \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1249210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy more kids' wear such as shoes, shirts, pants, and vests to expand the range of products that she sells in her store.

She produces traditional wrap-arounds with a design called \u201cRani Phi,\u201d well known on the national market. It usually takes about 10 days to complete one wrap-around. Through the loan she actually produced 50 wrap-arounds to sell and earned a good profit. She helps her husband to buy poultry feeding requirements and supports her son in a tutorial class after the school hour. She is very happy with the progress she has made in her business. \r\n\r\nNow Ibecha needs another loan to continue her weaving activities. She will use the loan to buy more yarns of different qualities and colours to weave and increase the production of traditional tribal wrap-around skirts for her business. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too needed the loan to upgrade their respective business undertakings. Sand sieving, jewellery business, weaving, and vegetable selling are the primary activities of the group members. As a group, the members meet every weekend for saving a fixed amount of INR 50 per member. In this way they function as a group.         \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1249223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy yarns of different textures and colours to weave traditional skirts to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibemhal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sorojini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanatombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibecha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibetombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-05T23:38:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":504037,"name":"Noral","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noral is a 37-year-old lady who lives in Ground Bassa County, one of the counties noted for fishing.

Mongolia. She works as an accountant for a local bank and her husband renders a taxi service. Her mother works at a company that sells cosmetics. She has been working for four consecutive years in the banking sector, moving from teller to accountant. As winter comes to Mongolia, their home and automobile are freezing, so they decided to build a garage next to their house. The garage will keep the car unfrozen and stop the house from losing its heat. The constantly frozen car has several disadvantages such as emitting harmful chemicals into atmosphere and using more natural gas to operate. She is requesting a 2,000,000 MNT loan to buy construction materials and hire builders. If the garage is built, it will benefit many things such as the family's wellbeing, house heating, automobile operation and most importantly the environment.

With support from her husband and her father-in-law, she\u2019s attained great progress raising pigs despite low, mid-year prices.  She\u2019s requesting this loan to buy feed for the pigs that are still in the growing stage.  The pig farm has grown and needs economic support to improve the conditions of the two most important assets in her farm: the breeding sows and a stud male and the pigs that she\u2019s fattening up and are about 3-months-old.\r\n\r\nLidia has been raising pigs for three years.  She has the pigpens, pigs and needs money to have enough to buy feed for 17 pigs she\u2019s raising.  She hopes to finish with this litter in May and repay her first loan installment and then get the money to invest in more feed because then the insemination and care starts.  She hopes the new cycle will produce 24 pigs to raise.\r\n\r\nThis loan will increase what\u2019s set aside because it\u2019s needed to cover the next two Development and Fattening-Up periods with which the expected number of fattened-up pigs for May, 2013, would be obtained.  The loan is projected to be repaid in two, semi-yearly payments, one in June and one in December.  According to the farm\u2019s needs, this projection will allow for capital at mid-year to start a new cycle of raising pigs and making the respective payments.  Feeding will be complemented also with growing corn and bananas on the farm to increase their weight at the end of the period.\r\n\r\nThis is a family business and it\u2019s grown considerably because it has two breeding sows to care for piglets from birth to sale; the entire production cycle is contained within the farm.  An investment in these animals has already been made to improve the birth and development of the piglets.  Birthing units were purchased and a sector of the pigsties was equipped increasing to three the zones for raising pigs.  This gave an important growth impulse to the business last year.  A pedigree stud pig was also purchased to breed with the sows thus guaranteeing production of good animals that if fed properly will develop well and this is the part of the business that lack of liquidity creates problems for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1248197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy pig feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Sarapiqui, Heredia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":238095.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":261904.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":488.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":536.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":511988.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410095018}],"funded_date":"2012-12-05T22:08:53Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T13:26:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":504150,"name":"Jessica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jessica, de 24 a\u00f1os es una mujer trabajadora.
