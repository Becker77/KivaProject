They have a wonderful, newborn son together. Jumakan's husband helps her with managing her business, mostly with selling the products. In search of a source of income for her family, Jumakan started working with poultry farming three years ago, after having invested 10,000 som (KGS) in this business. Thanks to persistent work, Jumakan currently has a well-developed poultry business, which brings in around 30,000 som (KGS) per month through sales of eggs and chickens.\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Jumakan needs to get new chickens. Because her chickens are old, she only gets around 40 trays of eggs per day, instead of potentially 70-80. Jumakan turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of 200 chickens. By increasing the number of eggs, Jumakan can increase her income. Jumakan plans to invest the income from the loan in developing her business. She plans to open her own sales point for selling eggs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1249773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She used to work selling food in a nearby market but decided to change her line of work due to the high level of competition her business had.\r\n\r\nMotivated by her great capacity for good customer service she decided three years ago to manage her juice stand and soda fountain independently inside one of the local markets.\r\n\r\nShe likes her work very much because she\u2019s very skilled in making various regional fruit juices like papaya, banana and pineapple, among others.  Her customers usually accompany their delicious beverages with a sandwich or other things she makes so she must always have the necessary basic ingredients on hand to make them.  This is why she wants to have back-up capital to buy various ingredients and keep her business stocked.\r\n\r\nOne of her main goals for the not too distant future is to buy a lot and start to build her house for her family\u2019s wellbeing.  This is her second loan and she wants to establish a good credit history so that she will be able to access a larger loan.  She\u2019s a very participative as well as very punctual member at her group meetings.  She will use the 500 new soles to add to her capital to keep her business well-stocked with the ingredients needed to make the sandwiches and to buy fruit at wholesale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1250470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Eyad wants to buy some necessary home appliances such as a refrigerator and a heater to use in this cold winter.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose Eyad took a USD loan from FATEN, which will help the family to cover some of its necessary expenses and live in better home conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:  FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

","en":"Khursan is 54 years old, married, and has 4 children. This loan will be Khursan's second with Arvand, where she has been a client since 2011. She proved herself to be very reliable with her previous loan, never once violating the terms of credit. Khursan fattens and sells cattle. She also processes milk, using part for her own consumption and selling part to her neighbours. Her husband is a pensioner and helps her on the farm, mainly by looking after the cattle and taking them to market to be sold. Two of her sons have gone to the Russian Federation to earn money. They also help their parents by sending money home. Khursan plans to use this loan to buy cattle to increase her herd. She is thankful to Arvand for the financial support.

They all live in a small village on the outskirts of Bishnupur in Manipur State, which is in the northeastern part of India. They came together as a group to avail a loan in order to create income activities for themselves.\r\n\r\nBimota is the group leader pictured with a raised hand. She is 38 years old and is the mother of three daughters and one son. She lives with eight members as a family. Her husband's main lines of income are selling firewood and bamboo. However, this source of income is exhausted by itself and takes time to replenish. Therefore, in order to supplement the family income, she usually weaves traditional garments but could not produce much due to limited capital at her disposal. She initiated and formed the group to fulfill the capital needs for her weaving income activities.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2009, she bought all the requirements for weaving (loom, thread, needs). She started weaving four days a week and was able to produce six traditional wrap rounds of different quality and four shawls in a month and a week\u2019s time. Her husband helped her out with the loan repayments for the initial four months. With the profits, she was able to repay the loan and buy yarn to continue weaving. \r\n\r\nWith her second loan, she was able to produce more by employing one more weaver and channeling her sales by supplying a retailer as well as selling some herself. With her income, she managed to support her children's education better. She was able to pay the children's school fees on time. She is happy that her oldest son can continue his graduation class. She is very happy with all the support that she gets from her husband as well as her children. Her children did well by bringing home their friends to buy the traditional garments that their mother weaves. In this way, people know where to buy when they need one.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to continue with her weaving business. She will use the loan to stock yarn of different colors and textures to weave the traditional wrap round, shawls and vest coats that she has been weaving. She also means to use part of the loan for the children's enrollment fees for the next session.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members also need another loan to upgrade and do better at their respective activities. The group members' activities can be classified as spring onion farming, fishery, piggery and yam cultivation.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1250061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy yarns of varied colors and texture to weave traditional garments.

She was left her with six children, of which 5 go to school.\r\n<p>\r\nSarah is a vendor dealing in the sale of secondhand clothes in various markets, especially in Kamwokya. This is how she is able to earn a living for her family. She started this business in 2003 after her husband passed away. Sarah\u2019s clients are people who visit the markets and a few of her regular customers place orders for different clothes. Her dream is to have a permanent business place where her customers can find her on a regular basis and also to see her children having a bright future.\r\n<p>\r\nHer major obligations are paying school fees, feeding children and paying house rent for the family, among others.\r\n<p>\r\nHer major challenges are lack of enough capital to raise enough returns to meet her major obligations and the weather conditions, especially during rainy seasons since she works in an open place, which slows down the growth of her business.\r\n<p>\r\nSarah is very hardworking, social, and honest. She will use part of the loan to rent a small stall in order to get a permanent working place and the balance will be used to add stock in her business in order to earn enough income to support her family and provide for all basic needs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1250266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to rent a stall to do her trade.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rubaga Road","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hadijja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":616666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":616666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":616666.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":617833.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339635426},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":616668.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":617834.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347362410},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":616665.01,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":617831.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589627},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":616664.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":617831.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993588},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":616670,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":617836.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040307},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":616665,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":617831.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381830942}],"funded_date":"2012-12-17T14:24:51Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:56:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":504460,"name":"Loyola Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose, who is in her late 30s, is married and living with her husband with two children of whom one is in school.

She is applying for her sixth loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua in order to start a new business to increase and improve her income to make sure that she will have a stable financial situation especially that she is aging with no one to support her financially.  \r\n\r\nShe will start selling clothes and she hopes that the styles she is going to sell will attract customer's attention.  She is a good standing borrower with an excellent history of paying back her loans.  Her previous loans helped her a lot in increasing her business capital.

These Tribal women live in a small village at the outskirts of Bishnupur town in the state of Manipur located in the North Eastern part of India. Unemployment is a big problem in this part of the country. \r\n\r\nPouphanliu is the member pictured with raised hand. She is happily married and is a mother to two sons and two daughters. She teaches kindergarten in a private school nearby where her husband is the school principal. All her children go to the same school where she teaches. Her salary, put together with her husband's, is not handsome enough to sustain the family especially when the children come of age and require a bigger amount for their education. Keeping this in mind she has been weaving from time to time to save even before accessing a loan. She also cultivated a homestead garden where she grows vegetables for consumption purposes.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2009, she purchased weaving materials and employed two weavers to weave traditional garments such as mufflers, sling bags and wrap-around skirts. Samples of the traditional wrap-arounds, her finished products, can be seen in the photograph. She was able to repay her loan on time and increase her savings. She used the second loan for the same weaving activities and began employing the two weavers full-time. She supplied the finished garments to retailers from the main city, Imphal, for bigger profit and faster sale.\r\n\r\nNow Pouphanliu needs another loan to increase her production by expanding her weaving shed so that she can hire one more weaver. She will buy tin sheets for the roof and do away with the thatch roof.\r\n\r\nPouphanliu plans to open a vocational school starting with weaving and incorporating other activities down the road. She also plans to introduce the handloom method of weaving. She is very happy that through her income activities at least two women are getting employed apart from the retailer.

","en":"Kaliyahan is 53 years old, married, and the mother of two children. Kaliyahan has a degree in Philology. By character, she is a very calm, friendly woman who believes in a bright future for her family and the country as a whole. \r\n\r\nAs a source of income for her family, Kaliyahan in 2010 started to engage in field crops and livestock, beginning this business with the sum of 10,000 KGS. Through hard work, Kaliyahan today has in her farm five dairy cows, and a monthly income from the farm of about 10,000 Som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Kaliyahan appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 Som (KGS) to buy two cows. Kaliyahan plans to use income from the loan to invest in business development by purchasing additional livestock, saving up for her son's wedding next year.

Mazira is a very kind and hard-working woman, but her fate has been a difficult one. When she got married, she and her husband did not have a house, so for several years they lived in a camp in a field. With the help of her parents, 15 years ago Mazira began her own animal husbandry business. She sells cattle that she has spent several months raising, and has many clients at the market. For 5 years, she saved up her earnings from this business to buy a house. Now she owns a cottage that she wants to renovate. She also wants to buy more cattle to develop her business. Mazira is now seeking a loan of 3,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy cattle and to purchase building materials to repair her house. With the income generated by this loan, she plans to provide her children with a good education and modern technology. She is waiting for your kindness. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1249934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials to repair her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mazira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":204.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":221.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":230.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":230.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":237},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":245.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":253.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":259.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":266.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":274.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":284.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":292.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.85},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":142.54,"local_amount":657.87,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-27T09:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":680.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331162988},{"amount":49.92,"local_amount":230.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":238.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510130},{"amount":53.21,"local_amount":245.57,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":253.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915420},{"amount":52.64,"local_amount":242.94,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693131},{"amount":54.62,"local_amount":252.08,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":260.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390555940},{"amount":55.98,"local_amount":258.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":267.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549805},{"amount":241.09,"local_amount":1112.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1150.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410958782}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T23:10:50Z","paid_date":"2013-10-21T08:42:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":504829,"name":"Leticia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Letecia.

Diana\u2019s dream is to study for a Master\u2019s degree in the United Kingdom and Kiva\u2019s support will help her be able to pay the application fee for the TOEFL exam, for the translation of her transcripts into English, for her application fees to universities in the United Kingdom and for her visa.\r\n\r\nOnce she gets her Master\u2019s and returns to Colombia, Diana dreams with working in the public, private or academic sector as a city and opinion leader who will foster the development of public policy and strategy to promote education of the city\u2019s human resources and create strategies for effective jobs creation that will push development and improve the levels of quality of living in her city and in the country.\r\n\r\nThis is her story:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my family\u2019s support to reach this dream, my parents are unable to cover such high costs as these because of their limited economic situation.  Even though I have my job as a teacher, the resources I generate at present are to support my family and help pay for my brother\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nKiva would be of great help and encouragement for me to reach my dream of studying for a Master\u2019s in the United Kingdom.  I\u2019m convinced that in order for people to be able to develop new ideas and learn good development practices they must learn through their own experience what other countries have done in order to develop: new opportunities and new methodologies for \u201cdoing it better;\u201d and I know that thanks to my academic excellence and my proactivity to learn and with a great amount of effort, I can reach this dream.\r\n\r\nFor me, it would be a source of pride and satisfaction to contribute to my city\u2019s and my country\u2019s development and to be able through strategies and\/or programs in public-private alliances to impact positively in improving the quality of life of those most vulnerable and in my city\u2019s economic development.  I\u2019m aware that a Master\u2019s in Development from one of the best universities in the United Kingdom would give me the necessary tools and knowledge to reach this set goal.  The only guarantee I have is putting all my effort into it and giving the best I have of myself.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1250289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay application fees for a Master's in Economic Development.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1900000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":1900000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1903231.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833624}],"funded_date":"2012-12-07T19:25:25Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T13:41:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":504849,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is 69 years old, a mixed crop farmer, married to Mary, a farmer.

With his loan he will try to get rid of the weeds and do some labor like making contour lines to prevent erosion. He is also going to buy fertilizer so that his lands make it to the next harvest in good condition and without the use of chemicals so that he can conserve the better properties of the soil and be able to replant coffee of the red Catuah\u00ed variety. In this way, he will plant a harvest of the highest quality and in the shorter term have a big enough field. Other than purchasing some seedbeds to plant  he will also take advantage of the fertile soil and climate conditions and other factors that favor the cultivation of coffee. With improved harvests, he hopes to earn more and be able to improve his family's living conditions and also invest a little in his harvest and achieve some other goals. This is the first loan he is applying for with FUDECOSUR. He has not had any other loans from national banks, but FUDECOSUR has offered him a loan with better terms and much lower interest rates. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":418.42,"image":{"id":1251031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"harvest coffee beans.

","en":"Chynara is 51 years old and is the mother of 2 children. She is a calm and industrious woman by nature. She has a high school education, and has been involved in farming from childhood. From back in Soviet times, Chynara has been working in animal husbandry and growing crops, which is the main source of income for the family. She started this business with a sum of only 5,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Thanks to her persistent hard work, her farm now includes 2 dairy cows and 10 sheep, and brings in monthly earning of around 7,000 Som from the sale of milk and dairy products. For the purpose of further developing her business, Chynara has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 40,000 Som to buy 2 cows. She plans to re-invest the income generated by this loan into her business by purchasing more head of cattle, and in the future she also plans to repair her house. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1249947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 2 cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Uchkun village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T17:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T17:30:01Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chynara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":40257.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749294}],"funded_date":"2012-12-09T20:17:17Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T09:47:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":504880,"name":"Mastula's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mastula\u2019s group is composed of two hardworking women.

married, and has 3 children. Her husband is a businessman, but he does not support his wife. Dilshoda always tries to cope with her problems on her own. She is very grateful to her parents for giving her the opportunity to learn how to sew from a seamstress. Now she sews beautiful dresses and has her own clients. For the purpose of providing her family with all the necessities, 3 years ago she started her own business. Prior to that, she had been a migrant worker in the Russian Federation but was unable to find acceptable work. Dilshoda currently works from home sewing dresses, and thanks to her good service, she has a good number of clients. These clients are women of good taste who are very particular and can be difficult to please, but Dilshoda easily manages to satisfy their demands. She has big plans for the future. She wants to open her own sewing studio and work with new designs and styles. She needs a new sewing machine, but her income is not sufficient for her to be able to afford one. Dilshoda is seeking a loan of 2,500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy a new sewing machine. Her hopes are on you and your kindness. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1249953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy sewing machine to develop her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilshoda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":101.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":119.61},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":128.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":134.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":137.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":148.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":156.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":162.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":164.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740885}],"funded_date":"2012-12-16T04:34:30Z","paid_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":504885,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercedes believes that \"a hard-working person will have a bright future\".

For the past 6 years, Florence has been working hard to manage her small pig business, in which she rears pigs. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more animals such as goats, and will help Florence to generate greater profits and expand on the business. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to start a poultry farm. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

It is a group of 13 women and 5 men led by Sarah pictured on the right with her hand raised. She is receiving an input loan for \u00bd an acre of maize and sorghum cultivation. Sarah joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season.  Sarah joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer. Sarah also thinks that One Acre Fund will be able to help her.\r\n\r\nSarah described her harvest as very good last year as a One Acre Fund farmer and hopes for another good year in the 2013 Long Rains season. Her biggest concern is sending her children to school. She plans on using future profits from the harvest to support her children\u2019s studies.  Additionally, she would like to help the needy in the village and continue being a One Acre Fund farmer.

He runs a Zoona mobile money transfers shop in his hometown of Mansa. Golden started running his mobile money transfers shop three years ago. He says his business is the safest and cheapest way in which people can move their monies from one place to another. He is very pleased with his business because he has seen it grow in transaction value. He believes he has been able to stay in business because he is financially disciplined. Golden says his biggest challenge is that the phone he uses to make the transactions runs out of connectivity. This slows down the business. Golden is hopeful that once the Kiva loan comes in, he will be able to increase his working capital and make more profit so that he can purchase a new computer to make his transactions quicker. Golden says this loan will go a long way towards boosting his business. He thanks the Kiva lenders.

She is married with four children, all of whom attend school. She is not looking after any additional members of the family.\r\n\r\nMariam has been selling charcoal in the market at wholesale and retail for ten years, working seven days a week. She does not earn any additional income. She has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT-SACCO to enable her to purchase more bags of charcoal to sell. \r\n\r\nMariam's challenges include seasonality of supply and transportation.

She and her husband have one wonderful daughter.  With her husband, Nazgul started farming and raising livestock in 2010 as a source of income for their family, starting this business with a sum of 30,000 KGS.  Thanks to Nazgul's hard work on her farm, today they have a cow, five rams and one tractor.  Monthly income from their holdings is around 10,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products.  With the goal of further growing her business. Nazgul turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase one cow and tractor parts.

Thanks to Kubanych's hard work, today his business contains two dairy cows, five sheep and a horse.  The monthly profit from the business amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and dairy products.  In order to further develop his business, Kubanych requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a cow and repair a barn.  He plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing his business by buying additional heads of livestock and save for his son's wedding next year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1250002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has a secondary education and got married right after finishing school.  She is a very good person.  She has good references from her neighbors.  They love and support her.  To provide a source of income for his family, Mahabat became involved in farming and animal husbandry in 1998, having started this business with a sum of 5,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains one cow, and the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 13,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and dairy products and also from farming.  In order to further develop his business, Mahabat requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a cow and four sheep.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing his business by buying additional heads of livestock.  Taking care of the children and providing them with a good education is the primary goal for Mahabat and her husband."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1250026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow and four sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Namatbek village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-07T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-06T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahabat ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10064.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862981},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10064.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013861},{"amount":850,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":40257.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426693}],"funded_date":"2012-12-08T19:34:06Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:12:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":504985,"name":"Thomas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thomas is a resident of Changamwe, Kenya.

Now he needs money to buy goats and feed for the livestock.  In the winter he will shepherd the livestock so that he can sell it in the spring for more money.  His parents do not work and because of this he needs to provide for them.  Also, he would like to get married in the spring and he needs to save a set sum for this.

She is 44 years old, married, and lives with her husband, Zviad, and three children (19, 13, and 12 years old).  Mtvarisa is unemployed at the moment. \r\n\r\nThe source of income for the family is an agricultural business. In particular, they grow nuts on the family-owned land and sell the harvested products locally. In addition, Mtvarisa has a milk cow and produces cheese with the received milk. \r\n\r\nMtvarisa and Zviad decided to start their business because their existing income wasn't enough for the family and their living conditions are poor. Mtvarisa's loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provisions of business start-up and restartup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nMtvarisa has noticed that there is high demand for fish in the market. In response to the local market demand, she has requested credit to finance the costs of constructing a dam, which she will build in her garden. She will purchase local species of fish and raise them in a pond. Beginning in the spring season, the fish will start to spawn, then they can be intensively sold. \r\n\r\nMtvarisa expects that development of the fish farm will raise the income of the family. Part of the increase in income will be reinvested in the same business and the other part will be used for improving the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1250912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

He is a very smart and capable young man.  After finishing school he enrolled in Tajik State University of Politics and Business in the department of Accounting and Auditing.  Right now he is a first year student.  He actively participates in all university events and deserves respect.  His teachers praise him for his work and decency and say: \"He is one of our best students.\"  His parents earn a small salary and are not able to pay for Dustmurod's education.

Since their income is not enough for the family's needs, Nikoloz decided to start up a new business. He went to a local credit agency to get money for this business start up, but without any success. His loan request was always rejected because of his low income and lack of experience in starting a new business. He received the loan in the framework of a start-up loan program that was initiated jointly by Credo and Kiva. This program aims at the provision of business start-up funds for the Georgian rural poor, who do not have access to regular credit products, as they live in poverty and are regarded as \u201cborrowers with a high risk.\" With the requested credit, Nikoloz will purchase chickens and raise them. After 4-5 months, he will start to sell them. The hens will be sold on the open market in a nearby town by Nikoloz. He will reinvest the profit for the further expansion of the farm.

She has a high school education. After graduating, she got married. She is a very quiet, friendly person. 15 years ago, as the main provider for her family, she started growing crops and raising livestock, starting with the purchase of 15 sheep. Thanks to her hard work, Baktygul's farm business now has 50 sheep and two dairy cows, and the monthly income from selling milk, dairy products, and livestock is about 15,000 soms (KGS). With the goal of expanding her business, Baktygul has turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 20,000 soms (KGS) to purchase 4 sheep.

Although both Ketevan and her husband work hard, they still live in poverty. \r\n\r\nKetevan requested a loan to start a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with reasonable terms to start-up businesses. These loans are provided to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low incomes. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ketevan will purchase a milk cow. She will place it in the old cattle shed located in her yard. She will start producing cheese and will sell it at the local open market. The family's income will increase by 150 \u2013 200 Laris, which is a 45 \u2013 60% increase.

He is 30 years old, married, and lives with his wife and 7-year-old son. Kakhi is, at the moment, unemployed. The only source of income for the family is the small income earned by Kakhi, who is involved in a frits trading business. The family lives in poverty. According to Credo estimations, they belong to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nKakhi decided to start his business as their existing income isn\u2019t enough for the family and their living conditions are poor. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of a business start-up and restartup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Kakhi will purchase a metal and plastic workshop.

He has children, but they do not live with him. He has been growing organic cocoa for thirty years, in a parcel located one hour walking from where he lives. He considers this an easy activity, without pressure from third parties.\r\n\r\nBecause he lives in a sylvan area, fruits like the ones from the cocoa tree grow optimally, which results in a good business alternative for all producers, like him. He wants to invest in grafted cocoa, and for that he needs to hire day laborers, who know the technique, in order to perform this task as quickly as possible. He also needs to buy compost.\r\n\r\nOne of his dreams, for the future, is to build his house with solid material, which will benefit his children. He pays for their education, although they do not live with him.\r\n\r\nThis would be his fourth loan with MFP. He deeply appreciates the opportunity of having access to these loans, and he does his part by keeping a good record.

Ten years ago, the company that both he and his wife worked for closed down all operations in Mexico, leaving them both unemployed. They decided to take the plunge and move to the US with their two small children.\r\n\r\nJesus now works as an operator of shipping construction machinery. His sons are now teenagers and his daughter is 7 years old. Not wanting to be dependent on one job, Jesus started a brand new business on top of his full time job.\r\n\r\nBlue Party Rentals, named after his daughter Azul (means blue in Spanish), rents out jumpers and jukeboxes for parties. His clients are primarily from the Latino community in San Diego, because he says, \u201cthey love to sing.\u201d What Jesus likes about his startup business is the interaction with clients who are generally in the party mood, and that he can mostly run the business during the weekends. \r\n\r\nHis Kiva loan will be used to equip his new entertainment business with 3 jumpers and 3 jukeboxes and to pay for liability insurance. Blue Party Rentals started operations in December 2012.\r\n\r\nJesus dreams of growing Blue Party Rentals to make it his primary occupation.  He wants to offer a one-stop-shop for event organizers by also renting out tents, tables, chairs and other party equipment. He hopes to continue providing for his family, and maybe one day even buy a home and send his kids to college.\r\n\r\nFind Blue Party Rentals on Facebook at:
