Both have been making and selling pies, hamburgers and hot dogs for many years, and this business is their only source of income. Salvadora is a hard-working, honest, and business-savvy lady, who won the loyalty of her customers thanks to the quality of her products. Building on her already existing customer base, she approached field partner INTEGRAL for a loan to invest in buying more ingredients to make her tasty products, such as bread, sausages, meat, sauce, etc. This way, she will be able to keep offering her customers, who are loyal and whose numbers are increasing, products of the highest quality, which will in turn increase her income and improve her life.

Our borrower has been involved in animal husbandry since 1996, starting in this business with an initial capital of 8,000 som.  Gradually developing and increasing her working capital,  she has also increased her cattle headcount and built a house.  Eager to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use the whole amount of the loan to buy three cows that she will raise and resell.\r\n\r\nTurgunbu's future plans include the creation of a large farm to raise cattle and other small livestock.  With the profits received from this activity, she is planning to marry her son and buy a truck.\r\n\r\nDuring the period when all necessary documents were prepared for this loan and a financial analysis was performed, our borrower gave a very positive image.  She appeared as a responsible, honest, conscientious and enterprising woman who knows how to properly run her business and invest her money wisely.  The borrower owns a barn and can provide all the necessary conditions for cattle grazing and management. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1250150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy three cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jalal-Abad town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-10T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-09T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Turgunbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":30192.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862984},{"amount":850,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40257.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426695},{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":30192.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749298}],"funded_date":"2012-12-16T10:04:59Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T09:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":505368,"name":"Corina Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Corina Guadalupe de cuarenta y seis a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus hijos en casa propia;  cliente posee un Chalet de golosinas, panes, bebidas entre otros en un centro escolar ubicado cerca de su hogar, ya tiene mucho tiempo de trabajo que le ha regalado  experiencia en las ventas y eso le permite obtener las mejores ganancias, ya tiene mucha clientela fija pues los estudiantes la prefieren porque comercia  productos de calidad, a precios accesibles pero sobre todo con un excelente servicio;  Corina es una mujer emprendedora con muchas ganas de salir adelante, tiene muchos sue\u00f1os que desea alcanzar y esta dispuesta trabajar duro para lograrlo, pues sabe que solo as\u00ed obtendr\u00e1 el \u00e9xito, como toda buena comerciante quiere acrecentar su negocio pero necesita de capital por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar golosinas por mayor, bebidas, panes, galletes etc. Corina Guadalupe tiene buenas referencias de pago y muy buena moral asegura que podr\u00e1 cancelar la deuda y al mismo tiempo tiene la confianza que podr\u00e1 darle a su familia una vida plena.","en":"Corina Guadalupe is 46 years old and lives with her husband and children in a home of her own.

He has been providing taxi services since 2010, and recently purchased plot of land where he built his own house. But due to a lack of finances, some of the construction work is incomplete, and as winter comes to Mongolia, he urgently needs to insulate and finish the remaining work. So Batdelger is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to buy insulating and construction materials. The finished house will ensure the well-being of his family members and, most importantly, will prevent heat loss and reduce the consumption of coal as a heat source. This action will certainly contribute greatly to environmental protection

","en":"Zainura is 53 years old and married. As her main source of income, Zainura raises livestock. Having started this business 17 years ago with a sum of 1,500 som (KGS), through hard work she has been able to make it grow so that it presently brings her 12,000 som (KGS) per month. Currently, Zainura keeps 1 cow and 11 sheep. She raises sheep of the Gissar breed for subsequent sale, and also sells milk and dairy products from home. Thanks to her business profits, Zainura can pay for her family's basic needs.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Zainura has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional sheep, whose price is low this year. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business, and in the future hopes to realize her long-time dream of performing major renovations in her

They live comfortably in their home. \r\n\r\nDoris sells groceries from a shop in her home, where she serves her customers; mainly her neighbors.  She started this business two years ago because she needed an additional income.  She used her own savings to start this business and was able to grow it and attract more customers.  She had problems with capital at first, but she got a loan to be able to start the business.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it allows her to work from home and she can count on an income.  It also allows her to use her spare time on other things and in caring for her home.  On the other hand, she doesn\u2019t like when her customers ask for credit because she had already had bad experiences with this type of sale and people didn\u2019t pay their debts.  Now she won\u2019t sell this way and only accepts cash and has had better results.  She plans to continue growing and expanding her business.  This will be her first loan through MFP and she is grateful for the financial support in solidifying her plans.  She also feels comfortable with the communal bank and with its members because she considers them to be responsible and united.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 1,000 PEN from this loan to buy primary needs products in quantity, finding better prices so that she can increase her profit.

Thanks to her persistent hard work, her farm now includes 4 dairy cows, 15 head of smaller livestock and 1 horse, and brings in monthly earnings of 15,000 Som from the sale of milk and dairy products. For the purpose of developing her business, she has now approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som (KGS) to buy 2 cows. She will use the income generated by this loan to further increase the number of livestock she owns, and to save up money to buy a vehicle.

Therfore purchasing a new sewing machine will help them to save time and stitch up more dresses in less time. This will also help them to satisfy the needs of clients more professionally and efficiently which will gradually increase their net income and savings as well. Farzana hopes that the loan will be beneficial to them.\r\n\r\nNote: In the picture Farzana holds a passbook in her hand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1251992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase fabric and a new sewing machine for her tailoring business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Rawalpindi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2012-12-10T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-09T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farzana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kiran","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marayam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1039},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4253},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":5540},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3448},{"due_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4747},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6185},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5156},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5349},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6969},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5814},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.24,"local_amount":4213,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-17T09:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4282.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331586809},{"amount":53.02,"local_amount":5050,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5132.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339471300},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":3016,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3065.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347023976},{"amount":49.07,"local_amount":4673,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4749.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356461253},{"amount":63.93,"local_amount":6089,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6188.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364472942},{"amount":53.29,"local_amount":5075,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5158.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372877343},{"amount":79.81,"local_amount":7601,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7725.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381648898},{"amount":73.17,"local_amount":6969,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7083.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390511061},{"amount":61.05,"local_amount":5814,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5909.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399759530},{"amount":15.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T10:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1524.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410032455}],"funded_date":"2012-12-10T19:08:05Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T10:56:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":505466,"name":"Ronah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronah is 27 years old and lives in the town of Kabwohe in the Kabwohe region of Uganda.

Her family also earns some income from a boutique and retail shop. Florence learned about Milango through a friend and she joined to access credit to improve her business operations. Florence's business challenge is the occasional low demand for her stock.\r\n\r\nFlorence is requesting a 31,450 KES loan to buy wholesale vegetables, greens, fruits, and clothing to sell. The extra income from her loan will be added to her savings to expand the business and pay for her children\u2019s school fees.

Approximately four years ago, she decided to operate a store out of her home in order to be able to take care of her children and help pay for their education. Milena is an educated woman with certifications in beauty salon and nail services. She is a woman who strives to excel and always improve. Her newest business has allowed her to financially support her children in their education. She manages her store in a very organized manner, every day she records her daily and monthly accounting so that she can track exactly how money comes and goes in her business. Her business is registered with the city and she has obtained all the legal permits necessary to operate it. \r\n\r\nMilena started this store with 70000 colones given to her from her husband so that she could buy merchandise. From there she began to develop her business and equip herself to diversify her services, for instance, by offering manicures and pedicures. She owns salon equipment and is currently taking her third course in a well-known cosmetology school. Two years ago, she began offering her manicure and pedicure services. Milena manages a portfolio of credit customers, those who patronize her business regularly, thanks to the ease of payment. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy merchandise (clothing, perfume, cosmetics, lingerie) and equipment (enamels and other foot and nail products). With this, she hopes to increase her profits since recently she has had limited working capital. After attending a meeting with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and hearing about its partnership with Kiva, she saw the possibility to realize her dream of saving money to buy her own house and be able to give her children a better quality education so they will become professionals.\r\n\r\nThis year, her husband's illness left her to confront their household expenses alone. Thanks to her hard work, she was able to overcome this situation and now her husband is back to work in his transportation

sons and 3 daughters. Her youngest son lives with her and helps her, and her other children are already adults. As the main breadwinner of the family, since 1997 Pazilat has worked in animal husbandry. She began this business with only 15,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS), purchasing 1 young calf and sheep. Thanks to her persistent hard work, today she has 10 sheep with lambs, 2 cows, and 1 horse. For the purpose of further developing her business, Pazilat has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 Som (KGS) to buy 15 head of sheep and feed for them. She plans to use the profit generated by this loan to expand her farm. She and her family have a long-held dream of buying a car.

married. As the main source of income for the family, 17 years ago she started her own business in animal husbandry and growing crops. Thanks to her persistent hard work, from a start-up capital of only 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS), she has managed to develop her farm to now include 2 dairy cows and 20 sheep, which generates an income of around 10,000 Som from the sale of milk and dairy products. Every year, the family work 2.8 hectares of land, where they annually grow beans and perennial herbs. For the purpose of further developing her business, Rakiyabubu has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som to buy bulls, since the prices are now low and a future rise is forecast. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to increase her herd, to host her son's wedding, and to build a large barn. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1248584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 3 bulls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ozgorush village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-10T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-09T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":101.96,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rakiyabubu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50297.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426687},{"amount":960.54,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50297.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":101.96,"payment_id":579488568}],"funded_date":"2012-12-26T03:20:22Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:50:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":505542,"name":"Darejani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Darejani is 53 years old.

Also, the family grows peanuts, maize, and different kinds of vegetables on the family-owned land. Darejani sells cheese and peanuts at the local open market. The harvested maize is used by the family for feeding the cattle. \r\n\r\nAll family members work hard, but the income is not enough for the six-member family. Darejani requested credit to expand a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions. These would be made available to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Darejani will purchase a milk cow. She will place it in the old cattle-shed located in her yard. She will produce more cheese and sell the cheese on the local open market. The income for the family will increase by 150 \u2013 200 GEL (Georgian Lari), a 45% to 60% increase. The living conditions for the family will significantly improve and the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1252111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To

His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with reasonable terms to start-up businesses. These loans are provided to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low incomes.

She is 38 years old, married and lives with her husband, 18-year-old daughter and mother-in-law. Olgha\u2019s husband works as a driver and her mother-in-law is a cook at a restaurant. Both of them get a monthly salary. As the existing income is not enough for the family, Olgha decided to start a new business. In particular, she plans to renovate her garage properly and rent it for a good price. \r\n\r\nOlgha has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. However, her loan request was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, for they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this loan, Olgha will purchase building materials to renovate the garage properly so that it satisfies the personal needs of her clients.

She lives with Lino, who is a fisherman and is the father of her 5 children: Kety, 15, Marjory, 11, Karol,  8, Cintia, 5, and Mateo, who is 3 years old.  It is for them that she exerts herself, so that she can provide them with a better quality of life.  The family lives together in their own home, which was purchased with a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nMaribel has a business selling fresh fish.  She starts working very early when she goes to the port to receive the fish that her partner has caught, so that she can later sell it from her stall in the busiest market in the city.  She provides her customers with friendly service, knowing that in this way she will gain their preference so that they will keep buying from her.\r\n\r\nMaribel started this business more than 5 years ago with her own capital, which she invested in fishing supplies for her partner so that she could sell the fish that he caught.  Later, seeing how well her business was received, she started increasing her sales.  She considers her business to be quite profitable, because of the good earnings she gets and the strong demand for her products, particularly at times when there is a shortage and she can raise her prices.  \r\n\r\nMaribel decided to start up her business so that she could support her partner with the household expenses and support her large family.  Now, seeing the good results that she has, she wants to keep the business going and continue with it, as it is her only means of generating income.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Maribel's 4th loan with MFP, and she expects that with this small loan she will be able to meet her goals.  Also, she comments that she enjoys working with her communal bank, because she considers it to be a group of people who are united and cooperative.  With the sum of 1,200 Peruvian soles that she requests, she will purchase fishing supplies for her partner, such as: nets, harpoons, traps, fishing lines, fish hooks, and other supplies.  This way, she can obtain her main product, which is fresh fish.  She is hoping to increase the volume of fish that she sells, so that she can increase her earnings.

Fares would like to complete his house and make some improvements by buying some construction supplies like cement, steel and other building materials . \r\n\r\nFares took a USD loan from FATEN to buy construction materials he needs to complete building his house.  This loan will help the family to live in suitable conditions and enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\nFares is photographed in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She\u2019s separated from the father of her 7 children.  She lives in her own house in the company of four of her children and her mother and father who support her in the care of her younger children.\r\n\r\nThe activity Cecilia does is crafts; she makes necklaces, bracelets and fabric with native designs and others.  To do so, she has a small workshop at home where she makes all her products that she then sells from place to place being very kind and gracious towards her customers who for the most part are tourists whose preference she\u2019s won over; she also goes to sell in other cities.\r\n\r\nShe started more than 18 years ago with her own capital and making small amounts.  She learned from her mother and now, seeing the good response she\u2019s had to her business, she\u2019s decided to continue and to date her little children help her produce; she does the selling by herself.\r\n\r\nShe considers the business to be quite profitable because she almost always sells out everything she makes producing good profits.  She decided to start this business because she needed to have an occupation and a source of income to cover her and her children\u2019s expenses since she separated from her spouse.\r\n\r\nSeeing the good results she\u2019s had with her business, she plans to continue with it and make it grow.

She has been working as a librarian at a library for over three years.  She loves her work of providing and recommending useful books to readers.  She respects well-read people very much.  Umedakhon's salary is not enough for normal living and this is why she wants to start a new business in animal husbandry, especially because her local climate is quite suitable for growing agricultural crops and for animal husbandry.  She has a large garden, where she can grow hay for livestock.  She wants to sell milk to her neighbors.  She wants to organize and develop her business, but does not have enough financial means for this.  Umedakhon is requesting a loan in the amount of 3000 somoni to buy livestock.  She plans to use the resulting income to provide her children with a good education and current technology.  She awaits your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1250723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

school. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income, Bubuya has been engaged in raising animals since 1992, starting this business with 1,000 KGS. Through hard work, Bubuya today has in her homestead ten dairy cows with offspring, eight heads of bull, and five horses. Monthly income from the business is 25,000 Som from mile sales. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Bubuya appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som (KGS) to buy livestock. Bubuya plans to invest income from the loan to further increase her number of domestic animals in order to increase revenue from milk and to save enough money to repair her home.

As a main income for the family, Gulnara works with livestock breeding and crop planting. After having started this business 18 years ago with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS), Gulmira has been able to develop her business thanks to persistent work. The monthly income is in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Today the farm counts 2 cows, 1 horse, 5 sheep and one tractor. Thanks to the income from the business, Gulmira is able to pay for the family's basic needs. Gulmira sells milk and dairy products from her home, as well as vegetables in the spring and fall. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulmira turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional livestock. This will increase the amount of milk and accordingly the family's income. Gulmira plans to invest the income in further developing her business, and in the future would like to repair her

","en":"Anar is 43 years old, married, and has six children. All the children and her husband help Anar with her business. Anar works with livestock breeding, which is their main source of income. \r\n\r\nAfter having started this business 12 years ago with a sum of 25,000 som (KGS), Anar has been able to develop her farm through persistent work. The monthly income is 4,000 som (KGS). Today the farm has 3 cows, 2 horses, 22 sheep and 3 calves. Thanks to the income from the farm, Anar can pay for the family's needs. Anar sells milk and dairy products from her home. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Anar turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of calves and lambs. This will in the future increase the amount of milk and therefore the family income. Anar plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business and in the future would like to fulfill her dream of repairing their house.

Yanush breeds cattle and keeps 90 lambs, 20 chickens and five cows. He sells milk and milk products as well as provides beef to local butchers. Yanush has 17 years of experience in this field thanks to his father, who taught him how to look after cattle. Selling milk and milk products to local markets helps Yanush earn a monthly income. But unfortunately, it is not enough to cover his big family\u2019s everyday costs. So, Yanush has applied for this loan. With the loan proceeds, he would purchase 25 lambs. He will raise and fatten them for five to six months and resell them at a profit in the local livestock bazaar.  This will significantly increase Yanush\u2019s income and will enable him to ensure a better future for his four children.

He serves his clients well, he has always a clean car and therefore the clients can have a nice ride in his car. \r\n\r\nSafar gets up early every day and washes his car and with an open mind and a smile on his lips goes to meet his clients. Thanks to his good service he has many clients, but lately his car, an Opel Vectra, has not been in a good condition. He urgently needs to repair it. If he does not repair it, he will lose clients who are very valuable to him. If he loses his business, the family's situation will be very difficult, as his wife's income is very small, and she is not able to support the family. \r\n\r\nSafar requests a loan in the amount of 1000 somoni for the repair of his car. This is his second loan, and he has a good credit history. Safar promises to repay the loan on time.

She is not married and lives with her parents.  She is a very hardworking and active woman.  She has had a lot of interest in sewing and cutting since childhood.  Thanks to her parents, she studied sewing from a seamstress.  Gulnoza is currently a capable seamstress.  To provide the family with all of the necessities, she started her own business four years ago.  She has her own sewing factory and apprentices.  Thanks to a good service, she has a wide circle of clients.  She teaches apprentices and serves her customers at the same time.  This year, her students learned a lot and started to help her.  Now she wants to expand her business.  She needs a new sewing machine for this, but her income does not allow her to purchase it.  Gulnoza is requesting a loan in the amount of 1500 somoni to purchase a new sewing machine.  She relies on you and your

He is married and has children. Ahmadjon's wife is a homemaker and is mostly concerned with raising the children. Ahmadjon is a very hardworking and responsible person. He tries to work a lot in order for his family not to need for anything. \r\n\r\nSince in his time Ahmadjon could not get an education, he has been engaged in selling yarn. According to his stories, this business provides a good income. Therefore, Ahmadjon is trying to develop this business as this is the only source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nWith the credit received, Ahmadjon wants to buy yarn and rope. He hopes that, with the help of this loan, he will be able to realize his plans. In the spring, he plans to give his eldest daughter in marriage, so he is buying thread and to save money until spring for the event. Ahmadjon is very grateful to Kiva for the financial support and understanding.

is a wonderful woman with a beautiful soul and beautiful thoughts.  She is 31 years old, married and raising three children.  All of her children are adolescents.  Her husband is a very kind person, who works on a construction crew.  He is an ordinary construction worker and earns a small salary, which is not enough to support three children.  To improve their living conditions, Anastasiya has been working as a janitor at one of the secondary schools in her town for over four years.  She does her work very well, and this is why all of the students know her as \"auntie cleanness.\"  She likes when she hears this response from the students.  Anastasiya's salary is small and not sufficient to purchase all of the necessary items or for repairs.  She and her family live in an old house that does not meet the minimum living standards.  The floor of her house has holes, and she needs to urgently install another floor because roaches come out of the holes all the time.  Anastasiya is requesting a loan in the amount of 3500 somoni to purchase construction materials in order to install the floor.  This loan will help her to repair her house; thus, bringing convenience and comfort to her house.  She has a lot of plans for the future, such as buying new technology for home and furniture.  Anastasiya and her children will wait for kind creditors to help them resolve the housing problem.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1250729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She has worked in different places and made hand-to-mouth a living. With much difficulty, she raised her children. \r\n\r\nHer children are not able to provide for their mother and so Roziya is planning to start a business.

He owns an adobe house given to him by his parents.\r\n\r\nHe learned the various techniques for getting a good cacao crop from a very young age, thanks to always participating in the ancestral work of his parents in the fields.  Generally, to finish the routine tasks on his land he hires day laborers who are comfortable with the work, being his former co-workers.  Later, after the work of the season, he manages to get good berries that he sells to the distributors in his area.  Nevertheless, he comments that his crops suffered a drop in payment in the final price, which was very detrimental to him.\r\n\r\nHe wants to have enough capital so he can start the growing season with everything he has to gain.  For this he needs labor from area day laborers to weed and he needs to acquire organic fertilizer, such as bird guano, which is indispensable for the type of soil he has on his land.\r\n\r\nHe's motivated to open his own business in the city in the future to grow stronger as a merchant and to contribute considerably to the finances of his family, whose heads are still his parents.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan.

In her husband Alfredo, 51, she has managed to find the ideal companion. Their happiness is complemented by their daughters: Sylvia, 27 and Vilma, 22, who with their mother's support are pursuing post-secondary studies. She owns a home constructed from wood. \r\n\r\nShe farms a few parcels of land that she acquired at a young age, where she devotes herself exclusively to looking after her coffee plantings. She has worked in this sector for 30 years, and has always had her husband's help for the various activities. On occasion, she hires day laborers for the more difficult and large-scale work.\r\n\r\nShe likes her farmwork due to the fact that it is very peaceful work, and at the same time, it is possible to sample the coffee beans that she produces, so that she can feel that the very selfless work she does will be valued by the final consumers in other parts of the world. In spite of the rainy season, it is a difficult time when it is necessary to make sacrifices. But thanks to the work she has done, she can finally get good earnings with the sale of the dried beans to the collection centers, who value her crop at a fair price.\r\n\r\nBefore the start of the rainy season in the area, she wants to have working capital to acquire coffee plants, and for having it planted by the day laborers in the area, who also will carry out the weeding and clearing of her parcels of land.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, with the fruits of her labor and effort, she plans to realize the building of a home with good quality materials. She is proud to have had 17 loans with MFP, and this is a reflection of her reliability and sound investments.

At first she had many difficulties, such as not knowing how to prepare the drinks, but in time she was able to learn.  Now she is one of the best in the sector, where she offers her delicious drinks.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing this for seven years and the most difficult part of her work is having to walk all day in search of customers.  She wants to have a store in the future, where she can sell all kinds of things, not just drinks.  What she really wants is to keep her customers because it\u2019s through them that she finds out which drinks are best liked.
