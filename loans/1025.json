Their children, now grown, are the proof that with work and responsibility, it is possible to provide a quality education, even with basic resources. They live in a wooden house. She has the family tradition of working in the fields on a permanent basis, maintaining over many years the techniques and customs that were inherited. This is how, 20 years ago, she was able to acquire her own parcel of land where she works producing organic coffee. She is very pleased to carry out the family tradition, because she has the unique satisfaction in being the future inheritor of the land that her family always worked.\r\n\r\nUpon starting a new coffee growing season, she has noticed that the plantings require weeding, since this is one of the factors that influences the quality of the coffee beans. She also wants sacks of organic manure to optimize production. In the future, she wants to open a grocery store, because she knows that the strength and energy that working in the field requires will not last forever. It is good to have various trade options.\r\n\r\nThis is her 14th loan. She proudly says that she has been able to overcome many obstacles thanks to the loans she has been given. She is very active in her communal bank, given that she pays attention to the agreements she makes and always tries to show her point of view when making specific agreements. With the 500 new soles, she will add to the money allocated to hire workers for an adequate weeding of her coffee plantings and to buy sacks of organic manure, which are very important to an efficient production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1252411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire workers and buy sacks of organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-12T02:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-11T02:50:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortunata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":58.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":59.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":69.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.64,"local_amount":54.1,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":55.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189049},{"amount":23.31,"local_amount":58.28,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":60.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572956},{"amount":23.71,"local_amount":59.27,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":61.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122606},{"amount":24.54,"local_amount":61.36,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":63.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868431},{"amount":25.16,"local_amount":62.89,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":64.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577257},{"amount":26.49,"local_amount":66.23,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":68.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529498},{"amount":27.23,"local_amount":68.08,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":70.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974577},{"amount":27.92,"local_amount":69.79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":71.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995993}],"funded_date":"2012-12-12T04:01:33Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":506164,"name":"Mamie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamie is 32 years old and lives in Margibi County, which is the rubber plantation county in Liberia.

She also takes care of grandchildren and elderly parents.  She has a business selling charcoal and has been in this business for ten years.  In addition to this, she also generates additional income from renting rooms.  \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan of 2,000,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more bags of charcoal.

She has been running a business of cloth trade for many years at her home. She started her business with just a few cotton cloths and over time she has become famous in her community for providing good quality cloths. She offers various types including linen, silk and cotton.\r\n\r\nBeing a single parent of nine children, she is responsible to provide them with the basic necessities of life. Three of her children are also working to contribute to the family income.

The community will benefit, because they will not have to go a long distance to buy foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nThe profits will help her to improve the housing conditions of her family, to provide better education for the children, and to expand her business.

With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will be empowered to meet their immediate financial challenges. And, at the end of each month, they can easily repay the loan using their monthly salaries. Their school\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for doing the deductions and making the repayments on their behalf. \r\n\r\nSalifu is the leader of this group. The 41 year old is a native of Affia village. He is married and has four children attending school. Salifu has served in the teaching profession for 12 years now. However, he is pursuing further studies.  He has therefore requested for this loan in order to pay his college fees. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1253014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay his college fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2012-12-12T05:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-11T05:50:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Foday B","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Salifu ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Samuel S","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Morlia ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":430000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.09,"local_amount":417500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":421252.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331236911},{"amount":97.09,"local_amount":417500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T12:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":421252.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340104627},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":433864.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347350179},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-21T09:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":433864.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357089709},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":433864.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373022573},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":433864.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381810465},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":433864.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390670589},{"amount":100,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":433864.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399916432},{"amount":205.82,"local_amount":885000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":892953.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410398261}],"funded_date":"2012-12-13T04:16:40Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:45:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":506183,"name":"Watta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Watta is a 49-year-old widow with four children who lives in Margibi County.

two children. His parents are provided with a retirement pension. At school, he was one of the best pupils and had a dream of studying at university. But, unfortunately, his parents didn't have enough income to pay for his education. Now, Vahagn works at a local company doing legal work. Last year, he entered Yerevan State University, where he specializes in the judicial field. \r\nRaising two little kids alone is very difficult for Vahagn, so he has applied for the loan.

She is a merchant and has sold various food items (tomatoes, potatoes, cocoyams, manioc, plantains, palm nuts, and fruit) at retail on a seasonal basis at a local market for 16 years. She has a good knowledge of the suppliers and especially her customers, whom she has acquired over time thanks to her experience in this business. However, she constantly faces stock shortages because she needs to sell her entire stock in order to buy new supplies, due to the small amount of capital she has. With this loan, she hopes to buy bunches of plantains and bags of tomatoes to build a larger stock, which will allow her to better satisfy her customers' constant needs and avoid stock shortages.

","en":"Uriat is a 53-year-old widow and mother of four sons. She is a good, quiet person. \r\n\r\nAs her family's main income provider, Uriate has been working in animal husbandry since 1980. She started her business with 3,000 som. Thanks to persistent work, today she has two dairy cows and ten sheep on her farm.

As the main income provider for her family, she has been working in animal husbandry for eight years. She started her business when she got married.

He has two children, Roy (14 years old) and Miky (11) but they do not live with him.  Yuri owns a home built out of wood.

He now buys various products from these local producers, such as cocoa, coffee, annatto, turmeric and barbasco, which he stores in a space in his home.\r\n\r\nHe says that he really enjoys his work because he does not feel forced into and it is modest work.  He must contact the bigger wholesalers from the city so that he can sell the products for a fair price, so that the products he is selling are profitable for the producers.  He would like some financial backing so that he can move his business forward, earn back his investment in the short-term, and make a profit.\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, his aim is to buy land in the city because his children will soon finish high school and, like any good father, he would like to support them with a good further education and their own home.

The family lives in a five-room apartment in Bamenda, North West Region, Cameroon. \r\n\r\nHonorine has faced some difficulties in life. A member of her family died after spending some time in the hospital and one of her children has been ill. She has had problems with feeding her children well and catering for their education. She has also had problems finding adequate capital to start up a business.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she has requested, Honorine will expand her business by buying more items to sell such as soap, laundry products, stocks and sauces and fruit drinks. \r\n\r\nPart of the loan will be used for transporting products from the market to her business site. \r\n\r\nHonorine believes her business will succeed because of her years of experience and the high demand for her products. She has a good business site and has regular customers who buy from her. \r\n\r\nHer community will benefit because they will not need to travel long distances to buy fruit drinks.\r\n\r\nWith the profits from her loan, Honorine will expand her business, help improve her family's housing conditions, and provide for her family's health and education. She prefers to use a loan from GHAPE because of the convenient repayment period, low interest and the social education provided at their meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1252968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They live in a five-room apartment in Bamenda in the northwest region of Cameroon.\r\n \r\nShe has faced some difficulties in life including the death of one of her family members after spending some time in the hospital for medication. Other problems she has encountered include the illness of her child, inadequate capital to start up a business, inability to provide good meals for her children and to support her children's education.\r\n\r\nWith the loan requested, she will expand her business size by buying more cloth and ready-made dresses. She also plans to buy oil in bulk and sell it in town. Part of the loan will be used for the movement of the products from the bush market to the business site. \r\n\r\nShe believes her business will succeed because of her longevity in the business and the high demand for dresses and oil in the market. She has a good business site and also regular customers who buy from her. The community will benefit because they will not go a long distance to buy oil and some of their dresses.\r\n\r\nWith the profits, she will help improve the housing conditions of the family, provide better education and health for the family and expand her business. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the convenient repayment period, low interest and the social education they provide at the various meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1253077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for cloth and ready-made dresses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Sisia,Nkwen, Bamenda, NW.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

It is located on the side of her house on the main street of her neighbourhood called Bosques de Vista Hermosa. She also sells general toys, pewter dishes, undergarments and clothes hangers.\r\n\r\nShe reports that sales are going very well and that every day her clientele is growing. Her clients increasingly request more items, some of which she already has, but other she does not. Because of this, she needs to request another loan to be able to buy the required items so as not to disappoint her clients when they visit her store. Christmas is soon arriving, and she thinks she should make the most of the holidays. She tells us that she already has some pants, jackets and women's boots on order, but she doesn't have sufficient money saved to purchase them. She hopes to continue receiving your support through the loans. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1254234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes to sell.

The high demand for her commodities in the community is a reason for the success of her farming activity, which she does on her own land. The community will benefit in that many people prefer to buy directly from the farm at cheaper prices. \r\n\r\nWith the profits from her businesses, Theresia will improve the situation of her family by providing better education and health care for them.

She is a cheerful woman with plenty of fighting spirit. Her partner left her 8 years ago, and now she lives with her parents and 10 year old son. He is her motivation to do everything she can to make progress in life. Kitty lives in her parent\u2019s house, and she works selling groceries in her grocery store. She opened up her shop in premises that are part of her parent\u2019s house. Her shop is very popular with the neighbours, and also with strangers who are just passing through the area. She serves everyone in the same friendly manner. The shop has been running for 4 years, now, and has become very well-known and popular. She can count on her parents to help out and serve customers sometimes, in their spare moments. Ketty considers that her business is profitable because she has become very well-known in the district. The majority of her customers are neighbours, and she serves them very well because she knows that it is their custom that provides her with her income. When she started out she could not count on support capital, and for this reason, she decided to take out a loan privately. Having the business gives her the peace of mind that she can provide well for her children.

He has a repair shop for small home appliances like fans, blenders, irons, pressure cookers and washing machines. He runs his business out of his home. He has customers from his neighborhood as well as from other areas of the municipality of Puerto Colombia. Miguel is a self-taught repairman, little by little with persistence and discipline he has made significant progress. As a result he has great dreams of prosperity, one of them being to have a storeroom of repair parts that are frequently requested by his customers. Since the field he works in is not overly exploited, he has great opportunity to benefit from his business. However, his biggest challenge is not having sufficient working capital to be able to meet all the market requirements.      \r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for his second loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he will use to buy repair parts for fans, irons, washing machines, and blenders. With the first loan he took out through this organization he was able to buy his first stock of repair parts, which have given him very good results. He hopes to continue in the same way, growing his business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1246611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy repair parts for fans, irons, washing machines and blenders. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-12T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-11T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94163}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":97635.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519770},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":97635.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497821},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":188334,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":195270.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527630},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":97635.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928386},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":97635.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705537},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":97635.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967829},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":97635.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817031},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":97635.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323315},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":97635.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082567},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":97635.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430061983},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94163,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":97631.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731688}],"funded_date":"2012-12-25T06:16:40Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tricia Kell","image":809712}},{"id":506458,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva is from Guingona, Ozamis City.

He needs to repair every room, as well as the kitchen and the exterior front wall of his house.  To this end, he is requesting a loan of 2,000 somoni to purchase building materials. \r\n\r\nTogboy promises to repay his loan on time.

He is married and is raising 4 children.  His wife, Nasiba, is a very smart and kind woman.  Bahodur is happy that he has such a good wife.  The children are not yet able to help the parents support the family.  Therefore, Bahodur is the main provider in the family.  He tries with all his might to provide the family with all the necessary resources.  He has been working as an electrician for more then 6 years.  He provides electrical services to local residents and earns an income this way.  His house is already old and he needs to repair all the rooms, starting with the entryway and continuing on to the children's room and kitchen.  His house is not winterized and he needs a loan of 2000 somoni for the purchase of building materials.  He promises to pay back the loan on time.  Bahodur and his children will wait until kind creditors help them to solve their housing problems.

These hard working Tribal women live in a small village on the outskirts of Senapati district in Manipur State located in the Northeastern part of India. This part of the state still lacks developmental programs, which is why these women came together as a group in 2008 to help one another to take a loan.\r\n\r\nNengneilam is the group leader. She is pictured with her hand raised. She is 39 years old and a mother to four sons and a daughter. All her children go to a private school nearby. Her husband's main source of income comes from cutting wood, which is a time-consuming process to turn into money. In order to supplement the family income, she took a loan to bridge the gap of cash flow by undertaking income-generating activities.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2008, she bought 3,000 pineapple saplings to grow at her farm. It takes three to four months time to harvest. With the sale profits, she was able to repay her loan and attend to the family needs such as the children's schooling fees and needs. With her second loan, she managed to cultivate on a larger scale. She purchased more pineapple saplings to increase her production. Effortlessly, she met her loan liability and with the profit, she, along with her husband's help, built a new house to live in, which is under construction. Together with her husband, she plans to provide a good education to the children.\r\n\r\nAt first, her husband was indifferent to her taking a loan. Now she is very happy that with the success that she had, her husband is willing to support her in sharing the loan responsibility. She is all the more excited that her husband actually suggested that he take the responsibility of tending the farm for her next cultivation. \r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to continue with pineapple cultivation. She will use the loan to buy more pineapple saplings to cultivate. She hopes that she enjoys a good harvest like the previous harvest and with the profit to spare, she means to finish building her house, which is half done.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too needed another loan to continue to benefit from their respective income activities. Pineapple cultivation comprises most of the activities of this group. One member has a piggery and another member opened a general store to generate income.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1252914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase pineapple saplings to cultivate and sell for profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-12-13T04:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-12T04:10:01Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chinchong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veitin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T01:52:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":506854,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 66 a\u00f1os de edad es madre de 9 hijos en las edades e 24 a 36 a\u00f1os; ella se dedica a la venta de carne de res, v\u00edsceras, especialmente los fines de semana y desde hace 32 a\u00f1os, cuando inici\u00f3 este negocio con el fin de apoyar es sustento de su hogar y solventar los gastos familiares.

They all belong to the Tribal community and hail from a small village located on the outskirts of Sadar Hills in Manipur State in the northeastern part of India. They came together as a group to help one another to take a loan.\r\n\r\nLhaingah, pictured with her hand raised, is the profile representative of the group. Since 1996, she has been living a widow's life. She is a mother to three sons and a daughter. All by herself, she shoulders parentat responsibilities trying to educate the children. She is very happy that now the two older children are on the verge of completing their graduation and the younger two are still pursuing their intermediate grade. She had done farming activities on rented land before her loan. Usually she would labor as a wage earner for extra income. In order to have a break, she abandoned the rented land to avoid paying high revenue to the landowners while she sweats.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 with her first loan, she bought two piglets to raise. In order to repay her loan, she sold one pig after four months to meet her loan liability. At the end of the year, the full grown other pig gave her a good income. With her second loan, she increased her production by raising four piglets. All her children help her by gathering waste food house to house for the pigs on a daily basis. From the sale proceeds of one pig, she bought pineapple saplings to grow in her homestead garden to sell at the market. In this way, she has been struggling to keep up and manage her children's education.\r\n\r\nShe always wanted to renovate her house's thatch roof to weather condition tin sheets and she has been saving but as usual, the savings will be used for the children's needs. She plans to execute her tin roof plans the following year, provided she is in good enough health to raise more piglets. Now she needs another loan to continue her piggery activities for better fortune. She will use the loan to buy at least four more piglets (preferably two female piglets for reproduction) to raise for profit. She also means to use part of the loan to buy new clothing for her younger children for the Christmas celebration. \r\n   \r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too need another loan to supplement their income activities. Pineapple farming, poultry farming, vegetable farming and vegetable selling are the preferable activities that the group is engaged in. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1253874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy piglets to raise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-12-13T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-12T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lhaingah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahchin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahchong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veikholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T14:05:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":506593,"name":"Katiba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Katiba is 42 years old.

His customers are his neighbors and people from other areas who visit him and who have known his for six years.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to expand his business by adding a second floor that will allow him to separate his personal space from his work space.

His goal is to open branches but his greatest challenge is his lack of capital to make this investment so that he can improve his living conditions little by little.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a Kiva loan so that he can buy medications in quantity, so that he can respond to the sales and have products on hand to satisfy his customers, which is the reason he has this business, so that he can generate income for his wellbeing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1246661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-13T05:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-12T05:50:01Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adanies","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":178332},{"due_date":"2013-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":184048},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":188343},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":192738},{"due_date":"2013-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":197235},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":201837},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":206546},{"due_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":211366},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":216298},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":223257}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.31},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100.31,"local_amount":178332,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":180810.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130879},{"amount":103.53,"local_amount":184048,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":186606.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519779},{"amount":105.94,"local_amount":188343,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":190961.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071614},{"amount":108.42,"local_amount":192738,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":195417.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497829},{"amount":110.94,"local_amount":197235,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":199976.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527637},{"amount":113.53,"local_amount":201837,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":204642.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928394},{"amount":116.19,"local_amount":206546,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":209417.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705545},{"amount":118.89,"local_amount":211366,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":214304.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967836},{"amount":247.25,"local_amount":439555,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":445665.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817038}],"funded_date":"2012-12-15T21:36:19Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:40:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

In 1989, as she was searching for a new source of income for her family, Aptakan began her own animal husbandry business with 5,000 som. Thanks to persistence and perseverance, she now has two horses, one cow, two calves, and five sheep for trade. Her monthly profit is about 8,000 som. \r\n\r\nWith long-term business development in mind, Aptakan turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a 70,000 som loan that will help her expand her farm by purchasing cows together with their calves.

Both of them are of retirement age. Usub is involved in cattle breeding and he keeps ten cows and 300 lambs. His wife uses the milk they produce in cheese production and Usub sells it in the local market. Additionally, he provides beef to local butchers.

Aside from work, she has a hobby of planting flowers, and she teaches alcohol-addicted people how to plant flowers in the summer time. In order to plant flowers, she needs some capital. So she is requesting the loan of 2,000,000 MNT to buy seeds, pots and fertilizer. \r\n\r\nLkhagvasuren's work is very beneficial to environmental protection. According to Project Green, plants help to remove pollutants from the air. During the process of photosynthesis, the flowering plants' leaves absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Additionally, the roots of flowering plants can help to hold soil in its proper place, reducing erosion and flooding.

three daughters. Her husband is a taxi driver, but his income is inadequate to fulfill the household needs. She is facing a very difficult time. Shazia, herself, is a tailor by profession and works eight hours a day with full dedication. In spite of working full time, she takes care of all the housework and makes sure that she can fulfill all of her children's needs. All of the income which comes from her tailoring business goes to the household expenses, on account of which she is unable to save any amount for her children\u2019s future. \r\n\r\nShazia, as a member of this three-person borrowing group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase fabric and a sewing machine for her tailoring business.

Barranquilla, donde tiene un negocio desde el a\u00f1o 1997, el cual inici\u00f3 al recibir su liquidaci\u00f3n, despu\u00e9s de haber sido empleado de una empresa. Inicialmente vendi\u00f3 frutas, por unidades, y fue agregando queso, carne, de cerdo, suero, mantequilla y tub\u00e9rculos varios, como hoy lo hace. Sus ventas las realiza de contado de lunes a domingo, desde las 6 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta 5 de la tarde. Carlos compra a proveedores de grandes abastos de contado. Aunque su negocio poco a poco ha ido creciendo, el volumen de compras que puede hacer, aun no es suficiente para satisfacer la demanda, pues tiene el gran desaf\u00edo de no contar con el capital de trabajo requerido para comprar en mayor cantidad, lo cual le permitir\u00eda lograr precios mas competitivos y responder a su potencial clientela, especialmente en la temporada que se acerca, la navidad y el recibimiento del a\u00f1o nuevo, donde el consumo de alimentos se incrementa y Carlos justamente vende lo que usualmente en su mercado, los clientes usan como insumos para hacer el delicioso sancocho trif\u00e1sico, un caldo, en el que se hierven o cuecen con tres tipos de, carnes de cerdo, res y gallina yuca, pl\u00e1tano, \u00f1ame, ahuyama, verduras,  y que es usual en las fiestas, para ser consumidas despu\u00e9s de tomar licores que causan  la resaca del siguiente d\u00eda. En la actualidad Carlos est\u00e1 aplicando al segundo financiamiento que hace a \u00e9l, la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el cual logr\u00f3 tener m\u00e1s capital de trabajo, para aumentar sus inventarios y as\u00ed mismo su clientela. Hoy est\u00e1 aplicando a su primer cedikiva, para comprar en mayor volumen, carnes de cerdo, res y gallina yuca, pl\u00e1tano, \u00f1ame, ahuyama, verduras y hacer su mejor venta, en la \u00e9poca que se aproxima, por lo cual espera convertirlo en una inversi\u00f3n exitosa.\n\n","en":"Carlos is 67 years old and lives in a community very near Barranquilla, where he has had a business since 1997.  He began it after he lost his job at another company.  At first he sold individual fruit but then added cheese, meat, whey, butter, and various types of tubers.  He sells for cash, Monday through Friday from 6:00 am to 5:00 pm and buys his wares for cash from large suppliers.  Even though his business has been growing little by little in size, the volume of goods that he can buy is not sufficient to satisfy the demand.  He has the great challenge of not having the working capital he needs to make purchases in quantity, which would provide him with more competitive prices and allow him to respond to potential customers, especially during the holiday season, when the consumption of food increases.\r\n\r\nCarlos sells what he usually sells in his market.  Customers buy ingredients to make delicious soup that they boil and add three types of meat, pork, beef, and chicken; plantain, smoked yam, and vegetables.  It\u2019s eaten at parties after drinking liquor.\r\n\r\nCarlos is asking for another loan, through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that he will use to increase his working capital and investments and number of customers.

He is employed and earns a small salary that is not enough to cover the family's needs. Ghaleb's son is a university student specializing in Engineering who wants to complete his studies, so Ghaleb is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help his son cover the cost of purchasing a new laptop. This will help Ghaleb's son to do his homework and reports and help him in his studies. This will ensure a better future for Ghaleb's son and improve the family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

","en":"Ana Maria makes cakes out of corn dough wrapped in corn husks (bollos) and fried products.  She is 64 years old and the mother of eight adult children.  She has been doing this for 30 years and generates an income to support her family.  She learned this from her parents when she was young and does it with great enthusiasm, while her husband drives a taxi.  Together they bring in an income to support the household.  Her main products are cheese bollos and fried products such as empanadas, arepas, corn fritters and donuts, which she sells to surrounding stores from 6:00 am to 2:00 pm Monday through Saturday.  Her business has grown gradually and she has had seven loans through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which has also helped her expand her sales and customer base within her zone.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a Kiva loan so that she can buy supplies such as dried corn and an electric mill.  This investment will allow her to get some discounts for buying in bulk and she will improve her production.  New and more modern work tools will make things easier.

For the past three years, Agella has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells dried fish. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Agella has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy fish that will be sold, and will help Agella to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Agella hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own. \r\n\r\nAgella is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

In addition, her daughter works as a teacher at the local school, and her son is a soldier. Both of them get monthly salaries. \r\n\r\nMarine requested a loan for starting up a trading business. Her loan requests were rejected each time, because she did not meet income requirements and she lacks experience in new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. But Marine\u2019s loan request was approved by Credo, as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-ups and re-startups. The program extends soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Marine will cover the costs of purchasing her initial inventory of basic groceries, for starting a grocery store. She plans to increase the turnover in her trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Marine will work hard, and she will be able to improve the living conditions for her family. With this loan, her family will generate enough income to access regular, available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event they need it in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":1254162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He lives in Tskaltubo District with his wife and two infant children. Gocha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of low income and the family's poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is a small agricultural business. They have a milk cow and 2 calves. The family produces cheese and sells locally. Their income is hardly enough for food for a four member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGocha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business and build a greenhouse. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Gocha will purchase all the building materials for the greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built properly, Gocha will grow greens and tomatoes. The harvested products will be sold for a good price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family income and all members will improve their living conditions.

She has seven children. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and personal business. She has been doing this work for 15 years.\r\n\r\nJustine stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"Poultry keeping and dairy farming!\" Her biggest challenges are animal diseases and expensive animal feed. Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Seroi' and 'Lelmet.' \r\n\r\nJustine will use the loan of 30,000 KES from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy poultry birds.\r\n\r\nJustine was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Because it gives loans to small-scale farmers, so as to improve their lives.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: \"They are financial institutions that offer short-term loans.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Justine replied, \"Money from the sale of poultry and its products will enable me to pay school fees for my children.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Justine owns the following: a cow, poultry, a bicycle, and an automobile, but she does not own a pig, a pump or a motorcycle. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, a sewing machine, and a television, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1254188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

These teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org based in Makeni (in northern Sierra Leone), to request a loan of 5,000,000 leones for both of them. With the help of this loan, these teachers can overcome their immediate financial challenges, and, at the end of each month, they can repay the loan, using their monthly salaries.

soured and she closed her office. She decided to pursue her dream of becoming a chocolatier. \u201cOne holiday season we bought some confections from a well-known candy giant; after sampling our purchase, my children said that I could do better.\u201d\r\n\r\nValerie started Zuzu Candies in February of 2012 in a rented commercial kitchen in Modesto, California. Over the past year she has refined her recipes, using local farmer\u2019s market ingredients. She established the business and hired her good friend\u2019s college-aged daughter to help with sales. Her chocolate does well at the local farmer\u2019s market; she won five stars for her French Honey Caramels in a very competitive competition that got her noticed by a well-known market in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nValerie has being doing everything by hand - a long and tiring process. She needs professional machinery to be able to produce enough chocolate and maintain proper temperature for her new, expanded markets. She would like to buy tabletop chocolate tempering machines that will allow her to produce up to 20 pounds of chocolate at one time.\r\n\r\nValerie is a single mother with three children. Her son Derek attends community college in Los Angeles and works part-time in the business, delivering chocolates to the local markets. She is requesting this loan because banks in her area do not make loans to startup businesses, so she turned to Fresno CDFI for financing.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to visit Zuzu Candies visit: www.zuzucandies.com"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6100,"image":{"id":1254489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 2 chocolate mixing machines and packaging materials for her candy-making business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Modesto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":266,"posted_date":"2012-12-13T17:30:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-12T17:30:26Z","loan_amount":6100,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valerie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":6100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":332.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.02},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.61},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":332.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.02},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.21},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":355.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":6100,"local_amount":6100,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-19T08:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924547}],"funded_date":"2012-12-15T23:17:20Z","paid_date":"2013-06-19T08:52:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":506882,"name":"Ashraf","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ashraf is a 31-year-old single man.
