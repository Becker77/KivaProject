He is a father to two sons and one daughter. He is employed and gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Yaqoub has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and a good second source of income for the family. Yaqoub wants to own a taxi, to improve his earnings. Therefore he is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN, to help him cover the price of purchasing a new taxi. Owning the taxi will enable Yaqoub to work extra hours and to accept additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income positively. Yaqoub is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fee. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages, to expand her product inventory.

She is married to Lino. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJennifer operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. \r\n\r\nJennifer also sells fish of different kinds and also meat. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJennifer dreams of having children and hopes to expand her business.

Her business is located in an area of her home, in the town where she lives with her partner and her children, ages 3 to 10. \r\n\r\nShe needs to buy steel, sandpaper, welding rods and polishing disks.

This is in order to pass them on to her customers at the end of the transaction. \r\n\r\nHer funds are insufficient to respond to the growth in her demand. This is because she sells 50% on credit and 50% for cash, and her recovery of debts is not timely enough to respond to her orders. For this reason, investing becomes a great challenge. This is why she is applying for a credikiva loan, her second with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy the necessary supplies so that she can succeed in being effective and increasing her income once again. This because the first loan enabled her to fulfill the needs of her loyal clientele, which she has built in the 24 years since she began, after having taken a course through the National Learning Service (SENA). There she learned the basic elements of ornamental iron work: designing, measuring, cutting steel, welding, polishing, painting and installing. \r\n\r\nToday in her business, she has a sales frequency of five days, buying the supplies for cash at steel distributors.

She has three children -- two daughters and one son. She is striving hard to meet their needs, including food, clothing, and health care. Her husband works in a workshop, but his income is not sufficient to meet the daily expenditures of the family. This compelled Yasmeen to start her own business, to contribute to the family income.\r\n\r\nShe has been in the business of sewing for many years. She is well familiar with the stitching techniques. She initiated her business with the support of Kashf Foundation; she took her first loan to buy a sewing machine.

As to its economy, it\u2019s an agricultural and animal husbandry zone and due to its climate and geography its crops are from both the coastal and the mountain regions.  Its residents live day to day from these activities and although it\u2019s far from the city there are families that have started all types of activities to cover their and their community\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nSilvia has been growing sugarcane for 13 years.  She works ten-hours per day in this activity caring for, watering and harvesting the crops.  She learned this activity from her mother and then with the experience she acquired.  Silvia is an enterprising woman who is motivated to continue forward by her own devices, for her children and for her family.  She does the work with help from her sister and also with her children\u2019s help.\r\n\r\nSilvia hopes to prepare herself to better manage her business and expects to increase her income with higher crop yields and hopes too for supplies to provide adequate care to her existing crops so as to not have any losses.  \r\n\r\nFundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has provided this tenacious woman with a loan to buy seeds and the necessary supplies to start this step towards expanding her business and thus improving her and her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1255308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nNolambay hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education through all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1190390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nolambay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2734.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095298},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.03,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3417.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484448},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2734.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036958},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1366.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781483}],"funded_date":"2012-12-15T14:22:27Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T11:36:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":507022,"name":"Elma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elma, 47, is married and has ten children.

Annet is 22 years old and lives in the town of Hima in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is marreid and has two children who are all currently in school. For the past five years, Annet has been working hard to manage her small business, through which she sells dry food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Annet has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more foods such as dry beans and maize to be sold, and will help Annet to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1254704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Shimshad is 35 years old and a married woman. She is the mother of two children. She has had a hand-embroidery business for the past 15 years. She is passionate about her work, and client demand is strong. But business challenges, combined with family expenditures, frustrate her nearly every day. Her husband is working as a laborer, but his income is not enough to support his family well. Shimshad's embroidery designs are very popular in her community, and she is the highest-earning resource in her household. \r\n\r\nShimshad wants to grow her business. She requested a loan of PKR 15,000 to buy raw materials, such as spools of thread, sequins and pearls, in many different colors, to meet the increasing demand.

She learned this work when she was little and this is how she supports her family.\r\n\r\nShe grows pineapples, bananas, and coffee in the town of La Esperanza (two hours from her home), where she goes frequently to look after her crops.  During the pineapple harvest, in a week she gets 100 crates of pineapples, which she sells for 7 soles [PEN] each.  \"In February the price is favorable for us because it reaches 11 soles a crate,\" she says.  That's why this month she works hard on her tasks.  Meanwhile she's harvesting oranges, which she sells in the closer city.  Although the price of citrus isn't favorable this month, she'll continue with her farm labor because it's what she likes to do.\r\n\r\nThis would be her ninth loan with MFP, so she's committed to making her payments on time.

Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es que le permite tener un ingreso econ\u00f3mico, lo que no le gusta es que los precios de los productos para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus comidas suben de precio, y eso varia en sus ganancias. Ella sigue esforz\u00e1ndose  gracias a que su puesto es muy concurrido  teniendo todas la ganas de ampliar su negocio. Con el pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 materiales para arreglar su negocio como calaminas y listones para arreglar el techado y con el saldo lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de los ingredientes necesarios para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus parrilladas.\n\n","en":"Maria is 59 years old and is a happy, dynamic, enterprising woman.

They use waste materials to craft their products, and it has a positive impact on the environment. \r\n\r\nAs winter comes to Mongolia, their newly built house is vulnerable to strong wind and frost, so she is requesting the loan of 6,000,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to buy construction materials and a low-pressure cooker, which cooks food faster than conventional pans, thus preserving energy.

He is married with two school-aged children, and is a proud father because his children, unlike others in his community, go to school. Durim lived in Greece with his family for a long time and worked in trades like masonry.  He has been back in his birth country for the past two years and continues to practice masonry. In addition, he has begun buying and selling new household items, which he has seen to be a very profitable activity.\r\n\r\nDurim is requesting his first loan in the amount of 150,000 Albanian lek to buy inventory of new items such as drapes, blankets and sheets.

tries to improve their standard of living and jump-start the economic situation of their family. She is a 45-year-old widow with 2 children. After the death of her husband, it was very difficult for her to manage to provide for her children. She grew crops for a living, but her earnings from this activity were not enough for her to buy all the basic necessities for her kids. Sarvar has decided to set up a new business for the welfare of her family. For this reason, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" that was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate. She wants to get into the field of buying and selling cattle. Animal husbandry is a very developed business where she lives, and there is a lot of opportunity for her to make a good income. She plans to use the money generated by this loan to get the latest technology for her children. Sarvar is seeking a loan of 500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy cattle so she can start up her business. She is waiting for your kindness.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1253037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To buy cattle to set up a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarvar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":36.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":37.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":44.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":47.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":595.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740909}],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T13:57:56Z","paid_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":507133,"name":"Ponciana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ponciana is a merchant from Panglao, Bohol.

Her husband is a kind man who works as an economist at a factory. Nasibakhon is the head of the human resources department at the polyclinic in her hometown. She is very intelligent, and has a post-secondary education. Her eldest son is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation, and every month he sends money home to help out. However, despite all their efforts, their combined family income is not sufficient for them to cover all their living expenses. Nasibakhon wants to buy winter wear, namely coats and jackets, for herself and her children, but she does not have enough money to do so. Winters in northern Tajikistan are quite cold, but this family does not have warm clothing. Nasibakhon is seeking a loan of 1,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy winter wear. This loan will help her to buy clothes that will enable her to protect her children from the cold, and she promises to pay it off on time. All her hopes are on you. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1253895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"To buy winter clothes for herself and her children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T13:50:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasibakhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":68.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":76.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15.39,"local_amount":68.42,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":73.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740911},{"amount":39.32,"local_amount":174.74,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":187.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056214},{"amount":18.09,"local_amount":80.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":86.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801913},{"amount":18.14,"local_amount":80.61,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":86.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510159},{"amount":18.68,"local_amount":83.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":89.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915445},{"amount":19.36,"local_amount":86.05,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":92.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693153},{"amount":20.11,"local_amount":89.38,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":95.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390555965},{"amount":20.29,"local_amount":90.17,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549829},{"amount":21.21,"local_amount":94.27,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":101.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410958804},{"amount":21.65,"local_amount":96.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":103.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420074973},{"amount":12.76,"local_amount":56.69,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":60.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430227681}],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T16:10:51Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T09:55:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":507135,"name":"Enkhbadral","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enkhbadral, 23, lives with his wife and daughter in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

years old, married, and has 2 children. She and her children live in an old house, but her husband has left for the Russian Federation and does not help his wife with the home repairs. They have had this housing problem for several years, but have been unable to deal with it because they have a low salary. Zamira has been working in a private company for several years. Her income goes towards providing for her family because supporting 2 children in today's world is not easy and requires a great deal of money. Zamira has taken out loans from our organisation before and has a good credit history. She fulfilled all the plans that she had hoped to with the help of her previous loans from IMON. This time, she has decided to take another loan so she can repair her house, because she no longer hopes for support from her husband. She needs to carry out repairs in her children's rooms and the kitchen. Zamira is seeking a loan of 2,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy building materials for home repairs. She and her children will wait for kind lenders to help them resolve their housing problems.

She is a very hard-working woman. From a young age she has had specific goals and has tried to realise them. She had a cherished childhood dream of becoming a fashion designer like Maria Lopez. This dream led her to learn now to sew women's clothing. For several years, she has gained experience in this field, and 4 months ago, she set up her own business. She took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" that was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she received a certificate. She has been trying very hard to develop her business but has not yet been able to because her sewing machine is very old and does a poor job. Her clients have made several complaints. If she cannot get a new sewing machine, her clients will start going to a different seamstress. Farangis is seeking a loan of 500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy a sewing machine to develop her new business. She is waiting for your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1253925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To buy a sewing machine to develop her new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farangis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":595.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740913}],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T14:51:23Z","paid_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":507148,"name":"Chepkoech","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chepkoech is a 30-year-old farmer in the county of Litein in Kenya.

She, along with her husband and children, manages her household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to save for the future of her children.\r\n\r\nMa. Nida operates a community pharmacy store. She retails basic medicines and vitamins to the community. She earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them piecemeal. Aside from this, she also sells mineral water for added income. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community members. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Nida is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional stock of medicines and mineral water to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMa. Nida hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband is a miller, and she grows crops. With each passing year, her children need more things and her earnings are not sufficient to cover the costs of providing for her kids. Her husband's income is also small. \r\nHurmat has decided to set up her own business. For this reason, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" that was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she received a certificate. Now she is fully capable of setting up her own business and becoming successful at it. She wants to get into the business of raising and selling cattle because there is great demand for animal husbandry in her region. She will buy cattle, raise them, then later re-sell them for a profit, thereby earning an income. She plans to use the money generated by this loan to provide her children with a good education and nutritious food. Hurmat is seeking a loan of 500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy cattle to get her new business started. She is waiting for your kindness. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1253936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To buy cattle to set up a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T14:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T14:50:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hurmat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":595.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740914}],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T16:40:24Z","paid_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":507160,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is a 28-year-old woman living in Kitale with her two children.

Felipa inici\u00f3 su vida de emprendimiento comprando una caja de cervezas, que vendi\u00f3 al detalle y obtuvo de manera inmediata utilidades que la entusiasmaron para reinvertir y aumentar su oferta poco a poco con otros art\u00edculos como mercanc\u00edas variadas, accesorios femeninos, papeler\u00eda y hasta agreg\u00f3 un caf\u00e9 internet. Sus ventas las realiza de contado y tambi\u00e9n tiene una clientela de clientes a los que vende a cr\u00e9dito, pero antes de otorgarle financiamiento observa su comportamiento para gradualmente darle esta opci\u00f3n. Su d\u00eda de trabajo inicia desde las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta la 10 de la noche, porque trabaja con mucho esmero, pues tiene el gran prop\u00f3sito en un futuro, de hacer una segunda planta a su casa, para independizar su vida personal de su espacio productivo y tener un mayor sosiego.  En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 cervezas por cajas, para distribuirlas en las tiendas y establecimientos comerciales, aprovechando las fiestas que se acercan, \u00e9poca en la cual el consumo aumenta, mientras en estos negocios se termina muy pronto los inventarios de bebidas dejando de vender en su m\u00e1ximo potencial.

Her business is located in a part of her home, where she lives with her spouse and four children, who are between the ages of 10 and 20 years.  Felipa began her life as an entrepreneur by buying a crate of beer which she then sold retail.  The immediate profits she earned from this venture encouraged her to reinvest and gradually increase her product line with various merchandise, such as women\u2019s accessories, stationary and even an internet caf\u00e9.  Most of her sales are done on a cash basis, although she also has customers to whom she sells on credit, but before offering financing she observes their behavior and only gradually gives them this option.  Her workday begins at 7 am and lasts until 10 pm.  She puts a lot of effort into her business because she is determined to add a second floor to her home so that she can separate her personal life from her workspace and have some more peace.\r\n\r\nFelipa is currently applying for a Kiva loan, which is her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy beer by the crate, which she will distribute through stores and commercial establishments.  She plans to make good use of the approaching holiday season when consumption increases and inventories of drinks are exhausted very quickly at a time of maximum selling potential.  At the same time, in order to satisfy the demand of her customers, she will buy clothing, footwear and women\u2019s accessories, so that her customers and their families will be well dressed for Christmas and New Year with clothing from her shop.  This will allow her to earn a little more than the usual, as always occurs at year end.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1247024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy beer by the crate, clothing, footwear and women\u2019s accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T15:10:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80049},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":84553},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86526},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":88545},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90611},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":92725},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94889},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":97103},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":99369},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101687},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":104060},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":109883}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":94.68,"local_amount":164602,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":170664.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071621},{"amount":46.59,"local_amount":81001,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83984.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527644},{"amount":54.11,"local_amount":94070,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":97534.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705553},{"amount":52.12,"local_amount":90611,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":93948.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817044},{"amount":402.5,"local_amount":699716,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":725486.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731692}],"funded_date":"2012-12-29T18:28:03Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":507172,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isabel is a 58-year-old fish vendor from Panglao, Bohol.

He is married and is raising four children. His wife Salomat is a very kind woman and a good homemaker. His children are still young and therefore Tojiddin is the only breadwinner in the family. \r\n\r\nIn order to provide for the family, he started his own business 12 years ago buying and selling livestock. His efficiency helps him to be successful in his business. He is gradually learning all aspects of his business and his customers are satisfied from his activities. Tojiddin has a car that needs repair. He is unable to repair the car and so he is requesting a loan for 3,000 Somoni for car repairs. This loan will help him restore the car and thus be used for the family's needs. \r\n\r\nTojiddin is a repeat customer of our organization and promises to repay the loan on time. He is awaiting your kindness.

Elmina. To prepare the gari, she buys raw fresh cassavas from the market. She washes and peels them, and then sends them to a mill to be turned into dough. Gari is popular among students and large families. Students eat it often because it is a quick and easy food to prepare. They soak gari with condensed milk and water, and sometimes add peanuts. Some students also prepare gari in the form of dough and eat it with pepper sauce and sardines.

He lives with his wife, Ceferina, and their six children, who they raise in a house that Rodolfo bought twelve years ago. \r\n\r\nTwelve years ago, Rodolfo set up his guinea pig farm in an area of his home. He raises 500 guinea pigs there, which he looks after very professionally. He separates them according to their genetic traits, thereby avoiding inbreeding. As a result he gets good animals to sell. \r\n\r\n\"I have regular customers for my guinea pigs, because they are a vitamin-rich foodstuff. Black guinea pigs also sell well in the market, because people believe that they cure certain ills.\" he says. \r\n\r\nHe now hopes to increase production, as he has lots of land on which to farm as well as many customers, and he can't meet the demand. That is why he hopes to be successful in his new challenge. \r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP. He is very happy to know he has financial support, and he likes being part of his community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive. What's more, the loan will be very useful in the progression of his economic activity. Rodolfo will use the money to buy wire mesh, poles and other materials to build guinea pig cages, and if any money is left over, he will also be able to buy black guinea pigs. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1255974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy wire mesh, poles and other materials to build guinea pig cages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodolfo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":308.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":334.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":361.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":369.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":383.99},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":397.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":415.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":429.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.46},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.9,"local_amount":308.69,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":310.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573006},{"amount":130.86,"local_amount":334.11,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":335.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122654},{"amount":141.46,"local_amount":361.17,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":363.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868476},{"amount":144.62,"local_amount":369.23,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":371.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577305},{"amount":150.39,"local_amount":383.99,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:57Z","rounded_local_amount":386.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529547},{"amount":155.76,"local_amount":397.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":399.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974611},{"amount":160.56,"local_amount":409.93,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":412.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996017},{"amount":167.29,"local_amount":427.12,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":429.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863675},{"amount":3.16,"local_amount":8.09,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353920}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T09:59:26Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":507230,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael is 32 years old, married, and has two children.

","en":"Mahabat is 35 years old, married, and is raising five children, the youngest daughter of which is a newborn. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income since 1990, Mahabat has been engaged in raising livestock and agriculture, starting with 15,000 Som and the purchase of one cow. Mahabat received land before the breakup of the USSR where she does annual planting of beans and potatoes. Through hard work, Mahabat and her family currently have in their household one dairy cow, a horse, 30 sheep, and two goats. Monthly income from the business is 3,500 Som KGS from the sale of milk and dairy products. Income from growing crops allows her to buy sheep and cattle at the end of the season. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Mahabat appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som (KGS) to buy livestock and to pay for preparation of her land for seeding.  Mahabat plans to use income from the loan to invest in further expanding the count of domestic livestock for fattening and an increase in income from the sale of milk, with the goal of saving money for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1254063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cows and sheep and to pay for field preparation for seeding","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kalba village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahabat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":20167.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631525},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":20167.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013868},{"amount":1275,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":60503.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426708}],"funded_date":"2012-12-17T12:55:09Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":507236,"name":"Jeanne Nepomuscene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanne Nepomuscene is a mother of two children.

Elsury prepared to be an assistant clinical laboratory technician in the Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, a public institution in Colombia.  This allowed her to begin working to finance her studies in nutrition and dietetics at the University of Antioquia.  During her program, Elsury began to become interested in the areas of public nutrition and research on the social factors that determine the state of community nutrition and health.  \n\nCurrently Elsury works in research and is a professor in a university.  Nevertheless, her salary is very low and it's not enough to realize her dream of undertaking the master's degree in community health.\n\nThe help of Kiva will allow Elsury to achieve her dream of finishing her graduate work so she can expand her knowledge of determiners of health inequality, get to know other cultures, perfect her knowledge of French and English, grow as a professional and as a person, and contribute to the development of her country.\n\nHere's her story:\n\n\"Since I was a little girl I've had a high social sense and have wanted to learn about the well-being of others.  Thanks to my job and my dedication I had the possibility of undertaking my technical and university studies in public institutions in my country.  This increased my need to contribute to national development and to the improvement of the living conditions of the population.\n\n\"Realizing this goal is what drives me to study the determiners of health inequality and motivates me to undertake the master's in community health in one of the best universities in Canada.  The knowledge and experiences I will acquire will help me to grow as a professional and as a person.  More importantly, they will give me the tools to serve society and assure that public health and nutrition policies will be more effective.\n\n\"Throughout my entire life I have sought to develop all my abilities, I have strived to make my dreams come true, and I have managed to realize them because of the love and energy I put into everything I do.\n\n\"I am convinced that when people put all their effort into something and are perseverant, they manage to overcome all the obstacles.  Since I decided to do my master's degree, I have faced many difficulties that I am sure I will be able to resolve by having the support and the help of

He is a conscientious, goal-focused, and hardworking man. He was born in a rural area with good conditions for crop cultivation and raising livestock. \r\n\r\nMamur's son is currently in Russia, but he doesn't have consistent source of work. So Mamur cannot count on having money sent home by his son and works himself, raising crops and animals. As a result, he has a fair amount of experience in animal husbandry and agriculture. His main crops are wheat, barley and corn. Mamur uses his harvested crops to buy livestock at the market for low prices. He then fattens the animals up for a certain period of time, and resells the livestock at high prices. The livestock is maintained by feed that Mamur himself grows. Mamur's wife helps him run the business.\r\n\r\nWith the income he makes from his business, Mamur has improved his living conditions. This year Mamur planted 5 hectacres of barley, wheat and corn. However, because of unfortunate weather, his harvest was less than anticipated. \r\n\r\nThat's why he has applied to our organization for a loan of 3000 somoni so he can pay for his son's wedding. His son wants to marry the woman he loves and start a good family. Mamur is counting on your generosity.

This is the main income source for his family. Refik is a very hard-working man, who works a lot to support his family. He uses his horse to carry wood in his area. The money he earns from this season he must save, also, for the spring and summer seasons when he does not have a lot of work to do.\r\n \r\nRecently the family moved into a new house in another place, and Refik wants to build a new stable for his horse. He is requesting a loan of 1,300 EUR in order to build a new stable for his horse. The loan will help him to have a place for the horse and to continue his business, which is very fruitful in this cold weather. He hopes in the future to ensure a better life for his family. His goal is to give a better education to his children. He is very grateful to all Kiva lenders!

","en":"Zamira is 46 years old and has 1 child. She is a very kind and hard-working woman, but her fate has been a difficult one. Her husband left her and their child, and does not provide any child support. Zamira has to manage to meet all expenses on her own. Her tough situation forced her to start her own business as a means of earning an income. For more than 7 years, she has been working in the field of processing and selling dried fruit, such as apricots. In the summer, she picks the apricots, processes them and sells them at the market as dried apricots, and she also sells other fruit that she buys from wholesalers. She is very courteous with her customers, so she has a large clientele. She uses her earnings from the business to pay for her child's food, clothes and education. She now wants to further develop her business. She needs to buy more goods to sell, but she does not have the financial means to do so. Zamira is asking for a loan of 1,500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy dried apricots. She is a repeat borrower of ours and has a good credit history. She is waiting for your kindness and promises to pay back the loan on time.

She is a fighting woman, friendly and hardworking. She lives with her husband William, 28 years old and they have a 3 year old daughter called Jeslyn. At the moment she lives in her mother-in-law\u2019s home, a place where she and her husband share the happiness of educating and raising her daughter and putting all their efforts and sacrifices towards providing her a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nElena sells groceries like rice, sugar, milk, eggs, oil, and she also sells soft drinks, sweets, fruits and other products. She has a space in her house for this activity where she serves her customers daily. In the afternoon she has a stand in front of the school in the area where she lives and there she works during recess until the time her children leave. \r\n\r\nShe considers the most difficult part of her work having to be under the harsh sun that is so intense in the afternoon. She has been doing this activity for seven years. She works alone while her husband works on his motorcycle taxi. What she likes most about her work is the freedom she has to do other things. Now she wants to implement a more expanded store with quality products. She hopes to soon achieve her goal and continue on the road to success and prosperity for the wellbeing of her family.\r\n\r\nThis is the eighth loan through MFP, so she is grateful to those who have made her loans possible so she can continue towards her objectives, and on her end she is very committed to once again complete her payments punctually as she did with previous loans she took. She is very happy to belong to her communal bank since all the members are very good, friendly, and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (2500 soles), she will buy more groceries such as rice, sugar, milk, eggs and oil, and also she will buy various sweets, fruit, and other products that children consume, and this way she hopes to maintain a stable income.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1256087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy sweets, fruits and other products that children consume","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-15T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-14T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":377.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":397.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":396.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":427.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":443.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":457.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":147.09,"local_amount":377.15,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":377.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189088},{"amount":155.21,"local_amount":397.99,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":398.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573021},{"amount":154.62,"local_amount":396.45,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":396.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122663},{"amount":166.77,"local_amount":427.62,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":428.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868489},{"amount":172.99,"local_amount":443.57,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":444.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577320},{"amount":178.32,"local_amount":457.22,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":457.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529561}],"funded_date":"2012-12-21T06:02:26Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":507784,"name":"Eddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eddy dreams of working in public finance.

dreams of becoming an engineer. Growing up with a mother who is a college professor, higher education has always been important to Geovana. Without her father to help contribute to the family\u2019s income Geovana and her mother have been struggling to afford all the costs of university and their home expenses. Soon Geovana\u2019s younger brother will be of college age and she hopes he will be able to receive and education as well without delay. In addition to school Geovana works 30 hours a week as a store manager but her income is not enough. Because of the national funding systems in Bolivia, frequently students in technical programs need to pay for the resources they use as part of the curriculum. As an engineering student, this often means extra fees for materials and machine rentals.  Right now Geovana can afford her tuition but is struggling to afford her extra fees and the cost of books and school supplies. With her loan, Geovana plans on purchasing her textbooks and looks forward to being able to save more of her income for her future and her family. Currently she makes around $5 a day, but with training in engineering, she expects to make $14 a day, with this income she expects to be able to make a big impact on her family\u2019s finances and be able to comfortably repay her loan. Engineering is her calling and with this education Geovana plans on helping her
