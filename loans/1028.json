She is a vendor and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages her household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJonalyn operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only the usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of time and money to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than buying raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She is also into a direct-selling business for additional income. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of Php20000. She will be using the loan to buy greater quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJonalyn hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of giving her children a high-quality education. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work; this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

After his professional training, he opened a hair salon that he has already been managing for eight years. He often encounters problems due to a lack of cosmetic products, equipment and furniture in his salon because he buys everything retail.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy more stocks of foam needed in her business.

Thanks to the hard work of Gulmayram and her family, the farm now has three cows and a herd of sheep and goats.  The sale of their milk and dairy products brings about 15,000 som (KGS) per month.  With the goal of developing her business further, Gulmayram has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy three dairy cows.

Two of her four children, a well as their grandfather, have become farmers and help in the family business.  Since 1994, Kantayim's family have been successful in raising livestock and selling their products at the market.  Beginning with a starting sum of 5,000 som (KGS), Kantayim has increased her farm's monthly income to 7,000 som.  To further increase the size of her herd, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 20,000 som (KGS) to buy some more livestock to raise.  She plans on using her increased income to build a new barn so she can improve the living conditions of her cattle and to marry off her son in the

She lives with her husband in Lafiabougou, one of the outlying districts of the town of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mail). Matogoma, having already tried several businesses without success, started her tailoring and sewing business 11 years ago. Her sewing workshop is located at the Sikasso Grand Market, where she already has 4 sewing machines, 2 of which are embroidery machines and 2 of which are simple sewing machines. Matogoma is much in demand by her client\u00e8le because of the quality of her services.\r\n\r\nIn order to better satisfy her growing client\u00e8le, Matogoma decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. After 2 individual loans which have been properly repaid, she is now requesting a 3rd individual loan which will enable her to buy some replacement parts for her 4 machines and 50 metres of fabric to sew and resell so that she can better respond to the expectations of her ever-growing customer base.\r\n\r\nMatogoma expects to make a monthly profit of 200 000 francs most of which will be used to contribute to the family expenses and to pay the loan interest. The rest will be reinvested in her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1257503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural

She is married, has two children, and lives with her husband in Hamdallaye, Sikasso.  Korotoumou set up her business buying and selling fruit, veg and tubers more than twenty years ago.  She sells her produce from her stall in the market and she has a lot of demand from customers owing to the good quality of her goods.  In order to satisfy her ever-growing customer base, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution approximately one year ago.  Having paid back her previous individual loan on time and in full, she is now requesting her second loan which will allow her to increase her working capital and buy half a pick-up truck load of plantains and 10 sacks of potatoes.\r\n\r\nKorotoumou buys her produce directly from farmers who come from surrounding villages.  She then re-sells the produce at the new M\u00e9dine fruit and veg market.  Most of her customers are itinerant merchants and they come from all over.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Korotoumou plans to make a monthly profit of 170,000 francs.  She will use this money to increase her working capital, cover family expenses and pay the interest on her loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1257500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy plantains and potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T15:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T15:20:14Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":137131.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922785},{"amount":275,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":137131.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819374},{"amount":275,"local_amount":133333.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":137131.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207267}],"funded_date":"2012-12-17T16:48:04Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T19:17:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":508254,"name":"Juvy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juvy is a 43-year-old resident of Catadman, Ozamis City.

She has opened a small food shop in a district of the capital which she has been running for 3 years already. Her small business works well thanks to her warm welcome, her experience in this line of work and the customer base which she has acquired over time. The number of the latter is becoming important, and she can no longer satisfy them due to her limited capital which forces her to buy her products retail. She is requesting this loan so that she can increase her inventory of palm oil, as it is a product much used by the people in her environment, and so that she can increase her profit margin. She will reinvest part of her profits into her business so that she can meet the needs of her customers, and the other part will enable her to meet her daily needs and those of her

In addition, they grow different kinds of vegetables on the family-owned land. Part of the harvested production is sold at the local open market, and the rest is used for family needs.

He will place the pigs in a shed located in their yard, raise them, and after several months the family will be able to have piglets.

seven who is named Ahmat needs your support.  He is 53 years old and is married to a wonderful woman with whom he has lived for many years.  His wife is a high school teacher and earns a small salary.  With the goal of providing for his family's needs, Ahmat started a business eight years ago in which he provides a taxi service.  He works hard to give the best service so he can attract more clients.  His eldest children also work, but Ahmat is the family's main breadwinner.  His salary is barely enough to live on and he has not been able to make repairs on his home for a few years, as he has no savings.  His home is very old, dirty and has no normal living conveniences.  His clever wife suggested that he ask for a loan to make the repairs.  This idea was the reason why Ahmat came to our organization to ask for a loan of 600 US dollars to buy building materials like cement and wood.  He is a repeat client and promised to repay his loan on time.  This loan helps a low-income family improve their living conditions.  Ahmat awaits your kindness and is counting on you alone."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1255645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials like cement and wood for repairing his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Yavan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.313056 69.043056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahmat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":42.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":57.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.79,"local_amount":42.79,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":42.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740933},{"amount":44.89,"local_amount":44.89,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":44.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056234},{"amount":46.74,"local_amount":46.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":46.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801932},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":45.82,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":45.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510178},{"amount":419.76,"local_amount":419.76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":419.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915463}],"funded_date":"2012-12-31T22:17:39Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":507590,"name":"Rahim","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0418\u0441\u0444\u0430\u0440\u044b. \u0415\u043c\u0443 63 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e 1 \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a. \u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c 40 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043e\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u0441 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044b.","en":"Rahim lives in the city of Isfara.

What is more, she is cheerful and friendly.  She is a widow and the children she had with her late husband are now independent.  It was for their sake that she strove to succeed in the face of adversity and it was the fruits of these efforts which enabled her to buy her own home, where she lives comfortably along with her tenants.\r\n\r\nCelina's business is selling dried hirapay (an Amazonian palm) leaves which are used for roofing houses.  She stores them in her house and sells them in the street on the pavement of the busy road.  Her customers visit her to obtain these leaves, which are in great demand, and because of the good service which she provides.  She set up her business over a year ago with a personal loan and, so far, has been able to rely on the help of her children and one other person whom she pays weekly.  She considers her business to be quite profitable on account of the earnings which it brings in.  Furthermore, she says that she got the idea of starting the business from her partner, who organises the harvesting of the leaves from the rain forest, and saw that it made higher profits.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, having seen the good results she has achieved, she plans to continue and increase her investment in the business.  This will involve obtaining a sixth loan from MFP, whose support she believes she can count on to pursue her goals.  What is more, she is once again committed to making all her repayments, as she did in the case of her previous loans.  She is happy with her communal bank which she considers to be a unified and caring group.  The 1,000 nuevos soles which she is applying for will be used in its entirety to harvest hirapay leaves, whilst minimising costs and attempting to harvest the greatest quantity of leaves possible, and thereby make higher profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1257669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy hirapay leaves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":151.46},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":151.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":165.48},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":171.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":178.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":181.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.58,"local_amount":151.46,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":155.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573023},{"amount":60.7,"local_amount":151.75,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":155.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122665},{"amount":66.2,"local_amount":165.48,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":169.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868491},{"amount":68.66,"local_amount":171.65,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":176.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577322},{"amount":71.21,"local_amount":178.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":182.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529563},{"amount":72.65,"local_amount":181.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":186.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974621}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T05:45:56Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":508460,"name":"Marisol","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marisol de 30 a\u00f1os es natural de Santa Rosa comparte una vida conyugal con Misael de 32 a\u00f1os, como producto de su vida marital tiene hoy a  sus dos hijos Milena y Juan.\nGracias a su trabajo y esfuerzo constante logro junto a Misael adquirir una vivienda a base de madera.

She lives in a civil union with Misael, who is thirty-two. They have two children, Milena and Juan. Thanks to her constant efforts, together with her husband, Marisol managed to buy a house made of wood. After graduating as a nurse in the city, she decided to come back to her hometown in order to help people. She has been working at the public health centre in Santa Rosa for seven years, honouring her promise to herself by being an active participant in her town's social development. As she is very dedicated to her work, she also helps sometimes at private health centres and clinics of her area, which helps her generate more income, which goes toward household expenses. Following her business instincts, she decided to start selling shoes from a catalogue. Her idea is to sell them to colleagues and to the other professionals she works with on a regular basis. In order to do that, she wants working capital with which to buy the first bulk of shoes as well as the catalogues, an activity that would generate additional income. In the future, Marisol would like to open a pharmacy, in order to keep helping people protect their health while generating more income to give her little ones a brighter future. This would be her fourth loan. Her sparing no efforts means that her position is stable and that she can count on her monthly salary to reimburse her loans seamlessly. Marisol feels a strong bond with the other members of her communal bank and says that everyone trusts each other. With this loan, she will buy shoes to sell from a catalogue and start her business in this field."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1257692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":159.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":175.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":180.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":186.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":186.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":199.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":202.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":210.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.62,"local_amount":159.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":163.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189090},{"amount":70.02,"local_amount":175.06,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":179.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573025},{"amount":72.33,"local_amount":180.82,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":185.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122667},{"amount":74.71,"local_amount":186.77,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":191.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868493},{"amount":74.48,"local_amount":186.22,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":190.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577324},{"amount":79.62,"local_amount":199.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":204.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529565},{"amount":80.86,"local_amount":202.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":207.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974623},{"amount":84.36,"local_amount":210.91,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":216.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996026}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T15:19:30Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":508464,"name":"Jacqueline Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jacqueline 29 a\u00f1os de edad, originaria de Managua, casada, madre de 1 hijo de 5 a\u00f1os, el cual cursa el preescolar de primaria, de oficio comerciante.

His life partner Corina is 23, and he wants to start a home, though he does not have children now. Thanks to their hard work, they have completed the first floor of their house with good materials. As a child, his parents taught him how to farm and, in particular, to grow organic cacao. Later, he decided to farm on his own, and 11 years ago he acquired land that he now works with Corina and is the main source of their income. \r\n\r\nTo increase their earnings, they have focused on producing cacao: removing weeds and fermenting and drying it. Weed removal is the most important task, since it is critical to keep the weeds from absorbing the nutrients in the soil. Evaluating the soil to determine the best organic fertilizer to use is necessary, and island bird guano is one of the best suited to the regional soils. Since Rober has a large area to cultivate, he wants to hire day laborers, and he will also spread organic fertilizer to ensure a quality crop. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet his goals and provide a brighter future for his children, Rober needs working capital. With this motivation, he expects to get ahead and continue to work hard. The 1,500 nuevos soles he has requested will be used to removed weeds with the help of the day workers and to buy sacks of organic bird fertilizer to ensure a quality crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1257724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers and to buy sacks of organic bird fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T17:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T17:20:12Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rober ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":159.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":175.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":180.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":186.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":186.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":199.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":202.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":210.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.62,"local_amount":159.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":163.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189091},{"amount":70.02,"local_amount":175.06,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":179.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573026},{"amount":72.33,"local_amount":180.82,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":185.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122668},{"amount":74.71,"local_amount":186.77,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":191.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868494},{"amount":74.48,"local_amount":186.22,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":190.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577325},{"amount":79.62,"local_amount":199.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":204.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529566},{"amount":80.86,"local_amount":202.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":207.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974624},{"amount":84.36,"local_amount":210.91,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":216.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996027}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T14:12:55Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":508347,"name":"Efua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Efua sells cassava, plantain and vegetables at Besease near Elmina.

With the received credit, Temuri will purchase a car and provide taxi services to local people. The family's income will increase and they will be able to improve the living conditions of the family.

is 61 years old and lives in the Chokhatauri District with his wife Julieta. He has asked for several loans from local financial institutions for his start-up business but without any success because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income the family has is the small monthly salary Julieta earns by working as a teacher at the village school. The family earns a total of 150 GEL per month, which is barely enough to provide food for a two-preson family. According to Credo, the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nJumberi is requesting a loan from Credo to re-start a family business which he had to stop due to financial problems. He will use his loan to buy rabbits and begin working in animal husbandry. He will buy cages for rabbits to live in and sell their meat, which is in high demand locally. Jumberi's loan request was reviewed within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program helps people begin businesses with convenient credit terms that are ideal for the rural poor who do not have access to the usual sources of credit. Jumberi believes that his new business, financed with this Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1257483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start an animal-husbandry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Amaghleba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jumberi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":137.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":153.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":162.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":162.51},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":168.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":172.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":182.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":187.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":193.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":198.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":204.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.67,"local_amount":137.81,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":139.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339566030},{"amount":93.15,"local_amount":153.43,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":154.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115603},{"amount":98.88,"local_amount":162.86,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":164.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861083},{"amount":98.67,"local_amount":162.51,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":164.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569888},{"amount":102.33,"local_amount":168.55,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":170.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968525},{"amount":104.45,"local_amount":172.02,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":173.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748943},{"amount":108.07,"local_amount":178.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":179.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612854},{"amount":110.54,"local_amount":182.06,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":183.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856596},{"amount":475.24,"local_amount":782.75,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":790.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133280}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T22:47:30Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T15:57:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":508357,"name":"Igball","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Igball is sixty years old.

She is 40 years old, married, and lives with her husband and 20-year-old daughter. Her husband works as a guard and her daughter is a shop consultant. Both of her family members earn a monthly salary. \r\n\r\nShe has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for starting a business, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected every time because of her low income and the lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nNino used to have a vet shop, which was stopped because of financial problems. She requested a loan from Credo to start a small business. Her loan request was approved via the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program includes business start-up and re-startup loans with conditions appropriate for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nNino already has obtained a building for the grocery store in the basement of 5-story building. With the loan, she will purchase inventory, as well as refrigerators for the store and meet her first customers. She will sell a variety of grocery products and is sure that the store will function profitably, as there are no similar stores nearby. The new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs, in order to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1257498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

and five children. Four of the children are still schooling. Rodah has been in farming for the past five years, producing bananas, maize, beans, sugarcane and vegetables. She sells the produce at the local market in her area, and she sells second-hand clothes as an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 30,000 KES loan from Juhudi kilimo to purchase a dairy cow, which will help her get more milk and hence extra income.

que todos los d\u00edas se levanta agradeciendo a dios por un d\u00eda m\u00e1s de vida, donde pueda trabajar para poder cumplir su sue\u00f1o\n","en":"Se\u00f1or David is undoubtedly a brave and hard-working person. He describes himself as a humble and honest man who loves his wife and two children. He feels that taking care of his family is more important to him than working.\r\n\r\nThe loan David has asked Fodemi for will be invested in buying breeding pigs and feed for them so that he can raise and then sell them, since there is a lot of demand now and he cannot pass up the opportunity, since his pigs are healthy and well-known.\r\n\r\nDavid's dream is to buy a large plot of land where he can build a large barn and carry on working raising and selling pigs, and triple the production he has now. He knows that it is possible to realise his dream but that he has to work, and this is why he gets up every day thankful to God for one more day so that he can work to be able to realise his dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1257750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She's a divorced mother of 4 children aged 18, 15, 12 and 10, three of whom go to school. In addition she  takes care of her sister's child whose parents lack the ability to take care of their child.\r\n\r\nRose operates a small stall near her home mainly dealing in the sale of matooke (green plantains), vegetables, fruits and other foodstuffs from which she earns a living for her family. She started this job in 2010 after she left her first job, which was tailoring, because she had started getting health complications, like chest pain, from spending a lot of time using her sewing machine. Rose's major clients are local residents where she resides.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her children finally having a better place to call home.\r\n\r\nHer major challenge is the lack of capital and lack of better storage facilities, which makes her perishable goods like tomatoes and fruits go bad, hence causing loss and slowing the growth of her business.\r\n\r\nRose is very hardworking, social, and honest. She will use the loan to boost her business so as to increase her income and meet her big dream of having a very decent home for her young ones.

She sells fried products, soft drinks and sweets in a kiosk.  Her experience with this business dates back two years, as she started it in the year 2010 when her husband was unemployed.  They both decided to use savings, the product of his severance pay, in the purchase of a kiosk and to begin their own adventure of generating income independently.  Initially, they bought a refrigerator and sold drinks and fried foods in a small quantity.  With what she earned from the sales she would reinvest to buy a greater assortment.  Hers is a family business, all the members of the family attend to it and little by little it has been growing up to the point that they are producers in greater volume.  Previously they bought fried foods from third parties, but as of today they make the fried foods themselves daily, having a great reception for being located in a strategic place in front of a large school, where their customers include the students from that educational institution, teachers and also the neighbors of the area.  They come to the kiosk and request the product that they want, especially in mid-morning, at lunch time, mid-afternoon and into the evening.  So, the clientele is abundant throughout the day.\r\n\r\nThe loveliest time of the year is approaching for families, Christmas and the New Year, and the clientele of Aurora will deservedly celebrate with unity in their homes.  They will spend what is necessary to feel happy.  For that reason Aurora will offer products associated with the time of year like desserts, sweets and drinks and she will need a larger inventory of packaged food products like potato chips, cheese snacks and cookies.  Faced with the prospect of increasing her sales, her working capital isn\u2019t sufficient to invest as she needs to, for that reason it becomes a great challenge and she is turning to a Kiva loan, her second financing with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to invest it in the purchase of a greater number of sweets and desserts to stock the business.  She also wants to diversify, selling lunches and special dishes.  They hope that the loan will help them to increase their sales, to be able to satisfy the demand of their customers and to earn more money that will benefit their home, as she has family dreams to fulfill that have to do with her four children.  She wants them to be able to continue studying and to continue moving forward in life, so that it is very successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1257679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sweets, drinks and ingredients for lunches for her kiosk.

Christmas and the New Year are very fast approaching and she needs to stock up her store with everything that is needed during this season, so that she can increase her sales as she does every year. Since she knows her business and each season's highest selling time very well, she keeps it well-stocked during each season. She has been doing this since 2008, when she first went into business with a general store. She used to own a hair salon where she provided her customers with beauty and personal image enhancement services. Later on, she gradually observed the market trends and opened the stationery store, which currently meets the demands from her neighborhood and other neighboring areas. She currently needs to stock up her business much more and her working capital is not enough to achieve that. That's the reason why she's requesting a Kiva loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She'll use it to purchase footwear, flip-flops and stationery items.

When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Susan replied, \"Improved quality of life.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Susan owns the following: a cow, poultry, and a bicycle; she does not own a pig, a pump, a motorcycle or an automobile. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household mosquito netting, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, a TV, or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi

She has four children and has been working in agriculture for 10 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops. She says what is most enjoyable about farming is: \"Poultry keeping!\" Her biggest challenge is the \"high cost of feeds.\" The animals in the farm are not named.\r\n\r\nLilian was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Fair interest rates.\"  She was also asked what she learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, and she said: \"Record keeping.\"\r\n\r\nLilian's highest monthly expense is school fees.

He lives in Barranquilla, a city on the Colombian Caribbean coast where it\u2019s hot year-round which is why his products are always in demand.  He worked in a frozen treat factory for more than 10 years and in 2004 decided to leave that job to start his own business.  \r\n\r\nEverything has turned out well for him these last 8 years so he\u2019s very excited and starts work every day at 6am buying ingredients at large commercial establishments and also in small local markets.  For the moment, Jorge sells directly to the final consumer but his business goal is to increase production and sell to supermarkets becoming one of their major suppliers.  For him, publicizing his business has been difficult but he hopes that by applying for Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo loans he will be able to expand production and win over more customers.  This is why he\u2019s now applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing with this institution that he will use to buy larger amounts of ingredients like whole, liquid milk, sugar, natural flavoring agents and butter.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he will start to increase production and will also increase his income because he\u2019ll have more working capital for his purchases and personal capacity for work and to produce.  Jorge is the father of two daughters aged 15 and 19 and he wants to give them and his wife everything in his reach to make them very happy now and in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1257828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Esther replied \"More income'\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Esther owns the following: \"cow, poultry,\" but does not own \"pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.\" Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

Ella vende productos como camisas, pantalones, blusas, ropa interior, cadenas, relojes y mucho m\u00e1s. Inicialmente vendia fantasia y ropa a sus compa\u00f1eras de universidad hace 4 a\u00f1os a cr\u00e9dito y en un t\u00e9rmino corto sus clientes le pagaban; posteriormente compr\u00f3 una vitrina y se instal\u00f3 en un lugar diferente a su lugar de residencia para vender estos productos directamente a sus clientes y agreg\u00f3 la venta de contado. Sus clientes incluyen amigos, familiares y vecinos,adem\u00e1s de los refer\u00eddos por estos mismos;    Gletys trabaja todos los d\u00edas, comprando sus productos en grandes superficies de almacenes en el centro de la ciudad y lo distribuye y exhibe en su punto comercial entre su clientela. En cada temporada ella ha aprendido a exhibir lo que la \u00e9poca requiere y esto hace que su negocio tenga un potencial de \u00e9xito. En este a\u00f1o su clientela ha crecido y se acerca la \u00e9poca mas linda del a\u00f1o, en la cual todos celebran en familia las festividades y para ello necesitan lucir elegantes y para ello disponen de sus primas y bonificaciones para gastar; es justamente en este momento en donde su gran desafio es tener el suficiente capital de trabajo para lograr complacerlos a todos y obtener sus mejores ingresos  del a\u00f1o, pero para ello no es suficiente el dinero con el que cuneta y ha decidido acudir a un credikiva, primer finaciamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  para invertir en m\u00e1s de estos productos como ropa, calzado, cosm\u00e9ticos, juguetes, papeleria navide\u00f1a etc. Gletys es muy joven pero tiene grandes sue\u00f1os.

She has a store where she sells clothing and women's costume jewelry. She sells products such as shirts, pants, blouses, underwear, chains, watches, and much more. Initially she sold costume jewelry and clothing on credit to her university classmates of four years, and her customers paid her after a short time. Subsequently she bought a display case and set up shop in a location outside of her home in order to sell these products directly to her customers, and she added cash sales. Her customers include friends, family members, and neighbors, as well as referrals from these people. Gletys works every day, buying her products from large stores in the center of the city. She distributes them and displays them in her store among her customers. During each season she has learned to display what the time of year requires, and this gives her business the potential for success. This year her customer base has grown, and the most beautiful time of the year is coming, in which everyone celebrates the holidays with their families. They need to look elegant for that and they have their bonuses and refunds to spend. It is at just this moment that her great challenge is to have sufficient working capital to succeed in pleasing everyone and to obtain her best earnings of the year. The money she has is not sufficient for that, and she has decided to take out a Kiva loan. It is the first financing she has had with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

This is his strategy for attracting customers and getting their attention, interest, desire, and purchase this season, when the best desires surface and all his customers want to decorate their homes for parties and share gifts that show the happiness and love of this season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1253222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stationery, accessories, and gifts for the home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":224142},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":241039},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":246663},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":252419},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":258308},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":277429}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":127.01,"local_amount":224142,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":228249.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519797},{"amount":136.59,"local_amount":241039,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":245456.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071630},{"amount":139.78,"local_amount":246663,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":251183.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497844},{"amount":143.04,"local_amount":252419,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":257045.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527654},{"amount":303.58,"local_amount":535737,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":545555.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928408}],"funded_date":"2012-12-26T19:20:00Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":508525,"name":"Batnairamdal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batnairamdal is 23 years old and lives with his new wife and newborn baby daughter in a ger in the Govi-Altai province of Mongolia.

She started her business in her house, knowing that it was a strategic location and it was a success.  The business sells women's clothing and candy, as well as offering phone calls to cell phones.  Her business started small and, little by little, Ana's painstaking work and discipline has made the business grow, allowing her to cover some household costs.  She sells candy directly to customers but she now has links to a business through which she will sell with product specialists.  Her biggest group of customers are in the south west of the city where Ana lives with her family.  Her goals are to increase her working capital so that she has a bigger income, which she saves with her husband's, and to make sure that her children have a good education and are successful.  With Christmas and New Year approaching, so is the season of Christmas bonuses and there are special offers available so that families and friends can buy very inexpensive gifts for all their loved ones.  Ana has visited her customers who have ordered a good number of candies but Ana does not have enough working capital to cover demand.  She is applying for a loan to buy candy in pretty packaging, which her customers will share with close family and friends.  She will also buy clothes so that the families look elegant at parties.  With this investment, Ana will increase her working capital by taking advantage of the season when the consumption of many items increases and when there is a lot of money going about.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1257867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy candy in pretty packaging and clothes for families to look elegant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T21:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T21:00:23Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39916},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45903},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":46974},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48070},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":49191},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50339},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51514},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52716},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53946},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61431}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.95,"local_amount":39916,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":43038.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519805},{"amount":27.54,"local_amount":45903,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":49493.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071636},{"amount":28.19,"local_amount":46974,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50648.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497851},{"amount":28.84,"local_amount":48070,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":51830.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527661},{"amount":29.51,"local_amount":49191,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":53039.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928415},{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":50339,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":54276.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705567},{"amount":30.9,"local_amount":51514,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":55543.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967857},{"amount":31.63,"local_amount":52716,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":56839.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817060},{"amount":69.23,"local_amount":115377,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":124402.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323338}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T00:16:19Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:53:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":508558,"name":"O\u00f1ondivepa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 lleva por nombre O\u00f1ondivepa, que significa todas juntas, y es que son 15 mujeres de la ciudad de San Lorenzo que trabajan juntas para poder salir adelante y ayudarse las unas a las otras.\nLiz, la presidenta es parte de este grupo, comenta ella que siempre tiene muy buena predisposici\u00f3n para poder ayudar a sus amigas y que siempre las anima a seguir trabajando.

She is 54 years old and is married with two children at home.  Her husband is retired and receives a small pension which is not enough to support the family.  With the goal of providing for her family's needs, Mohsafar started a business 39 years ago sewing women's clothes.  She receives orders in her own home.  Many of her clients are her neighbors and women who live near her region.  She tries to give the highest level of service so as to attract many clients.  Thanks to her good service, she has a wide range of clients.  She uses the income from her business to support her family.

The elder two children are in high school and the younger one is in kindergarten.  Rahmatjon's wife is a homemaker and this is why he is the only breadwinner in the family.  He always tries to provide for his family's needs.  Rahmatjon started his business in baked goods - he worked as a bread driver - and now he works as an installer of aluminum composites.  His colleagues know him as a kind and hard-working man and they value his friendship because Rahmatjon is a true friend.  He uses his salary to support his family and provide for their needs.  Since his children are in high school, they need a computer, just as Rahmatjon himself needs it for his work.  He is asking for a loan of 500 US dollars to buy a computer.  This loan will help him increase his children's level of technological knowledge.  He has many plans for his future and he is trying to make them all happen.  He is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1255773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer

farmers throughout Kenya. Her work involves training farmers and building market linkages with suppliers of environmentally friendly products that are needed within local communities. Over the last several years, Joyce has worked with thousands of low-income farmers that grow tea, coffee, flowers, and vegetables. She started Boma Safi Limited to support the many farmers who lack access to sustainable energy and products that alleviate poverty. \n\nThe Boma Safi product line now includes solar energy solutions, as well as clean cookstoves, water purifiers, and women's health products. These goods are sold directly on farms, as well as in rural open-air markets and two small shops that Joyce now operates. Boma Safi (meaning \"clean home\" in Swahili) has quickly built a reputation as a trusted voice in the East African Fair Trade community.\n\nJoyce leads a small team that conducts workshops on farms across Kenya, demonstrating the positive aspects of solar when compared to traditional energy sources such as candles, kerosene, and disposable batteries. With years of experience selling a variety of solar products, Joyce began working with One Degree\u2019s team in Kenya in 2012 after collecting feedback from farmers about BrightBox, a new solar energy kit that powers lights, phones, and radios. During workshops, farmers would exclaim \"stima!\" - meaning electricity - when seeing BrightBox lights in action, and Joyce knew she found a winning solution.\n\nSince September 2012, Joyce has already sold hundreds of BrightBox systems to farmers. She already has requests for many more, which she would like to provide before the holidays. While happy with her initial success, Joyce has been selling to farmers on a regular cash basis, while many others cannot afford to pay upfront. These same lower-income farmers are sadly stuck spending $10-$15 per month - a considerable portion of their income - on lighting and phone charging.\n\nTo break this cycle and provide renewable energy to these farmers, Joyce would like to start offering flexible payment terms to those who need it most. She seeks support from Kiva lenders to make this happen.\n\nJoyce will use funds for 150 BrightBoxes, which will be used to energize and empower farming households across the region. Farmers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them over several months. Since they are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4-5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. With your help, Joyce will help farming families eliminate energy expenses, improve safety, and allow their children to read into the night.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7500,"image":{"id":1255500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"to pay for solar energy systems and offer financing plans to lower-income farmers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Naivasha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.716667 36.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":"2012-12-17T23:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-16T23:00:06Z","loan_amount":7500,"lender_count":233,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":646000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":7500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":646000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":7500,"local_amount":646000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":646133.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331222536}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T01:53:58Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:26:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":508553,"name":"William","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"William, un hombre emprendedor y muy humilde, tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y vive con su familia actualmente, el solicito un pr\u00e9stamo con el anhelo de  comprar insumos como abonos, y fumigantes, el desea dar asistencia a los cultivos de caf\u00e9, con la finalidad de mantenerlas en buenas condiciones durante su desarrollo, para obtener un producto de buena calidad y factible a la hora de ser comercializado.

Several years ago, Dairo decided to start his own business. He started out in his house, with a cash register and a table where he put the few tools he started out with, acquired with his severance pay. That went well for him, and little by little, he bought machinery and launched his business idea, which has generated income to sustain his household ever since. Currently, he offers motorcycle and bicycle repair services and sells parts and accessories for both. His customers are motorcyclists and bicycle owners from his neighborhood and nearby areas who recognize the quality of his work. \r\n\r\nWith his loan, Dairo hopes to increase his income so that he can one day expand his shop, add more display cases, and hire employees. He says that the lack of capital is the main limitation keeping him from realizing this dream; his goal for his family is to educate his daughters, turning them into professionals with successful futures. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Christmas is approaching and children and young people want to have brand new bicycles in addition to the toys that El Ni\u00f1o Dios [the Colombian equivalent of Santa Clause] is bringing.

Currently they are situated in a rented house that her mother is offering them. As part of starting conjugal life she chose together with Saul to start their own business because of the fact that it was necessary to offer a good quality of life to their little one. \r\n\r\nIt's like this thanks to the experience that her partner acquired throughout his life as an assistant in an automobile workshop, completing until today 2 years of unstoppable work. Daily his workshop received visits from various drivers of the locale because they are trustworthy people and because they are in a much traveled street where vehicles circulate that travel around the rural zones of his region. It's like this that thanks to this self-sacrificing work they are able to forge a livelihood that benefits their young family. \r\n\r\nIn order to expand their business they have planned to acquire tires to be sold because of the fact that some customers don't use these repaired components, hoping in this way to obtain good profits later. In the future they want to purchase a plot of land and later build a house in order in this way to complete the famous saying \"casado casa quiere\" [the married want a house] according to her very happy comment. This is her first granted loan for which she feels very happy and peaceful in turn. She shows her firm commitment to work from now on with her communal bank and to be punctual to meetings.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, segundo financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1, calzado, ropa, tela, para elaborar sabanas, pues tambi\u00e9n conoce este arte y en Diciembre sus ventas de art\u00edculos de cama se incrementan. Desde hace 4 a\u00f1os cuando inici\u00f3 su negocio, su clientela ha ido creciendo, porque su experiencia le indica que clase de art\u00edculos vender en cada temporada y esto lo aprendi\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n de su madre y de su hermana que le ayudaron a iniciar este negocio. Las ventas de Carlos, las realiza una parte a cr\u00e9dito y otra de contado en periodos semanales; \u00e9l trabaja diariamente desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la tarde o m\u00e1s, si as\u00ed lo requiere su clientela. Entre sus principales clientes, est\u00e1n sus vecinos, amigos, familiares y referidos por estos, que gradualmente, han ido incrementando sus cuentas por cobrar. Con su primer cr\u00e9dito con esta organizaci\u00f3n, logr\u00f3 aumentar sus ventas y   el volumen de sus compras, ahora sus metas,  giran alrededor de tener un local propio bien posicionado , en un espacio comercial de mucha concurrencia de clientes, para cada vez mas, aumentar sus ingresos vendiendo en mayores vol\u00famenes.  ","en":"With Christmas and New Year's Eve coming up, Carlos plans to increase his shop's inventory in order to be ready for the upcoming busy season. His customers are largely comprised of neighbors, friends, relatives and others to whom he has been recommended. Some of these, he allows to make purchases on credit, and others by weekly payments. For this reason, a lack of working capital has been Carlos' biggest challenge in carrying out his plan to better stock his store.\r\n\r\nSince he opened his business four years ago, his clientele has been growing steadily. He has learned through experience and through the wisdom of his mother and sister, who helped him get started in this business, which items sell more during each season. Carlos works daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. or later if his customers require it. He makes and sells pajamas, footwear, women's accessories, and many other things customers are looking to buy in December to celebrate Christmas and the New Year with their families. That is why he is requesting this Kiva loan. It will be his second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Carlos will use this loan to buy footwear, clothing, and fabric to make sheets. His work is well-known, and in December, his bedding sales increase. With his first loan, Carlos was able to increase his sales. Now, his goals revolve around having a well-positioned business where he will attract more customers and, thus, increase his sales and revenue.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1257994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married to Richard, a seaman, and a mother to her children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAmalia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices, and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmalia hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1258105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She makes round rugs out of excess textile cloth she bought from the factory. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, they are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Florentina sells her products directly to her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like cloth, fabric and thread. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nFlorentina hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married and has one son. Her husband works as a home repairman. Her son graduated from secondary school and enrolled in university. Mukaddas has worked as a seamstress for more than four years. She works in a tailor shop in the city center. Her husband does not earn enough money and Mukaddas always manages the expenses by herself. Mukaddas lives in a house that is in disrepair. Her house is in bad condition and she needs to repair it, but because she does not have any savings, she approached IMON International for a loan. She is requesting a loan in the amount of 2500 somoni to purchase building materials such as paint, cement, etc. for home repair. This loan will help her improve her housing situation and, as a result, improve the morale of the family.

She is married to Ramon, a businessman and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEufrocina operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. She also sells vegetables. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nEufrocina hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams that all her children will finish their studies.
