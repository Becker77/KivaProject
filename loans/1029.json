She is married to Rodolfo, a security guard and she is a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nWilma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nWilma hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life and giving her children a good education to reach their dreams.

married, and has two children.  As a source of income for her family, Ainagul is in the animal husbandry and farming businesses.  She began the animal husbandry business 10 years ago with 20,000 KGS.  She began farming after the collapse of the USSR, when the collective farms fell apart and everyone was given their own piece of land.  Today, Ainagul has one cow and 10 sheep.  She works 2.5 hectares of land where she grows beans every year.  Today, her businesses bring in about 5,000 som (KGS) per month.  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Ainagul applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of one milk cow.  Ainagul plans to invest the income in further increasing the size of her herd, and to eventually save up money for a home remodel.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1257147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 1 milk cow ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kalba village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainagul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":170,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8054.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631531},{"amount":170,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8054.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743653},{"amount":255,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":12082.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776949},{"amount":255,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12082.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426720}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T14:00:50Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":508899,"name":"Copaboka 4 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"V\u00e9nuste, agriculteur du riz et membre du groupe solidaire COPABOKA 4 est mari\u00e9 et \u00e2g\u00e9 de 44 ans.

Rajabali and his wife try very hard to give their children everything they need. \r\n\r\nRajabali is in the animal husbandry business.  He fattens cattle at their home.  He also grows grain crops and is the chairman of the farmers' association.  Since his salary isn't enough for living, he is forced to be in the animal husbandry business.

competent woman. She is the mother of five children and a teacher of many students. She is married and her husband is a collective farmer. They live in poverty, but are happy because they have a mutual understanding and they support each other. Burihol is a middle school teacher and has quite a lot of experience. Her students love her very much and use her knowledge. Her colleagues know her as a hardworking and kind woman. \n\nShe receives a small salary, and her husband's income is also not enough to support the family with all the necessary means. For many years, they have been unable to repair their home, which is substandard. Burihol urgently needs to repair her home. Because of the lack of amenities, the children are always cold in the winter. Burihol is requesting a loan of 1,500 Somoni to buy construction materials, such as cement, sand, paint, and the like, for home repairs. Burihol is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1254871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She lives together with her husband and her two daughters who are 3 and 8 years old.  The idea for Isaura's business came about when a neighbor asked for her help in making dolls, sheets and curtains.  That is when she first learned the craft and started being paid for her work.  She later set up her own business without any technical training but simply making the most of her ability to look and re-create what she saw.  \r\n\r\nIsaura's business goals are to acquire her own premises, create jobs for other people and train continuously until she manages to perfect her skills.  Her goals for her family are to offer her children a higher education and to provide her husband with even more help in covering their household expenses.  In her business, Isaura makes dolls, linens, sheets and curtains.  She sells these goods for cash from 8.00am until 5.00pm.  She pays for her purchases in cash and prefers to buy in bulk so that she can obtain special discounts which she can then apply to the price of her finished products.  \r\n\r\nIsaura is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy a sewing machine which will improve her production time and the quality of the finishing on her products.  She will also invest in raw materials and supplies which she will use to bring to life her Christmas designs as families like to decorate their homes with decorations representing the most beautiful

","en":"Tuychiboy is 22 years old. He is not married and lives with his parents. He is a very hardworking and dedicated young man. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, he enrolled at the Technical Vocational Institution and graduated with honors in 2009. He learned how to weld and for more than three years he has been providing welding services. He makes gates, fences, furnaces, etc. He provides these services on order. In the course of a month, he takes 10-12 orders. He uses the income received for the family's expenses. \r\n\r\nHis father wants to go abroad, but has no money to buy a plane ticket. He asked his son to buy a ticket. Tuychiboy also has no savings to buy a ticket, and so he turned to our organization for a loan of 1,500 Somoni to buy a plane ticket. He is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1254841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

She began this business in 2010 and it generates an income that benefits her household.  She had taken a course where she learned how to prepare these items and a year later decided to begin her own entrepreneurial venture.  Little by little she has been growing and consolidating her domestic market.  She sells for cash from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm and fills orders for neighbors, other companies who place orders with her, and small businesses from the sector.\r\nHer suppliers offer her discounts if she buys her supplies, such as wheat flower, in bulk.  She passes her saving onto her customers and keeps them happy so that they will return to buy more.  She is asking for a Kiva loan, through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy wheat flour, and dessert-making supplies.  Since November she has been taking orders from families who want to celebrate Christmas and New Year with sandwiches, pastries, and desserts.  Mar\u00eda wants to be able to fill these orders with the products she makes with her own hands and tickle the taste buds of those who buy them and share her love of delicious puddings, desserts, etc. over these lovely December festivities and traditions. During this time her number of customers and income will increase.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1246673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33864},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":37376},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":38249},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":39141},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":40054},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":40989},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41945},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":42924},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":43926},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":44951},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45999},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":50582}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.95},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.32,"local_amount":33864,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36513.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130910},{"amount":22.43,"local_amount":37376,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":40299.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519799},{"amount":22.94,"local_amount":38249,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":41241.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497846},{"amount":23.13,"local_amount":38556,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":41572.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527656},{"amount":24.39,"local_amount":40639,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":43818.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928410},{"amount":24.59,"local_amount":40989,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":44195.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705562},{"amount":162.2,"local_amount":270327,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":291474.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967852}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T17:20:30Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

","en":"Abdumalik is 27 years old and married, but they have no children.  His wife, Bioysha, is a seamstress and sews beautiful traditional women's dresses.  After finishing high school, at his parents' advice Abdumalik began work at his own business.  For more than four years now he has been trading in cars.  He buys old ones, repairs them and resells them for a higher price, thus earning a profit.  He uses the income to support his family.

The loan will be used to increase her stock of essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil, sugar,and salt to attract more customers, and will help Josephine to generate greater profits and to pay for her medical bills.

","en":"Nelson is 31 years old. His business is in the center of the city of Barranquilla in the commercial zone, which is home to a large number of businesses of different sizes and product lines. He sells female accessories and cosmetics, with which he plans his future.\r\n\r\nWhen Nelson started his business, he had already paved the way to success. He first started working as the head waiter and began saving to be independent, and develop his free, entrepreneurial spirit. Even at that time he didn't know to what he would devote himself, but with the trade relations he observed, he was directed to the costume jewelry merchants. So he bought a commercial point to start while he continued working so he could start his business while continuing at the restaurant. Therefore, he would be supported while creating his business and creating his own jobs, such as sales assistant.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy with his activities, because thanks to them, he has managed to travel to other countries, such as Panama and Peru. Nelson is considered very enterprising and successful with the potential to grow. \r\n\r\nIn his business, the doors are open Monday to Sunday from 8:00 in the morning until 6:30 in the afternoon. He wants to grow his business, so he approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to apply for a loan financed by Kiva. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he will buy a large volume of jewelry such as necklaces, clips, earrings, and bracelets. With them he will renew his inventory and get more since he is purchasing with cash and in a large quantity.

For the past two years, Violet has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Violet has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil, sugar, and salt that will attract more customers. This will help Violet generate greater profits and pay her medical bills. Violet hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business into a big supermarket. \r\n\r\nViolet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past 2 years, Prisca has been working hard to manage her market stall, which sells raw food.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prisca has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more raw bananas called matooke to be sold, and will help Prisca to generate greater profits and pay her medical bills. Prisca hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own.\r\n\r\nPrisca is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

Uganda. She is single and has two children; one of them is currently in school. For the past two years, Christine has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Christine has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase stock of essential commodities, such as milk, cooking oil, sugar and salt, that will attract more customers, hence increasing profits. This will help Christine to generate greater profits and pay her medical bills. Christine hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand her business into a big supermarket. \r\n\r\nChristine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1258265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The loan will be used to buy more raw bananas, called matooke, to resell. This will help Margret generate greater profits and pay her medical bills. Margret hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own. \r\n\r\nMargret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past two years, Grace has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Grace has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil, sugar, and salt to attract more customers.  This will help Grace generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Grace hopes that in the future she will be able to buy cows and build a house. \r\n\r\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past 3 years, Agnes has been working hard to manage her small clothing sales shop. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Agnes has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase her inventory of different fashionable clothes for resale, and will help Agnes to generate greater profits and to pay for her family's medical expenses and school fees. Agnes hopes that, in the future, she will be able to build a permanent house for her children. \r\n\r\nAgnes is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

This will help her to get more produce and to earn extra income to assist her in uplifting her livelihood and in paying for her children's schooling. Sarah's major farming challenges are insufficient funds, pests and diseases. She aspires to open a milk bar to supply the whole market with milk in the next five years.

She is separated, and has three children who are now independent, and she works as a seamstress.  She lives in her own house that, with a huge effort, she managed to build.  As a seamstress, Bertha makes clothes for men, women and children for all occasions: graduations, important birthday celebrations, school events and other occasions.  She works in her own house, in a well-equipped room that has sewing machines and furniture.  It is here that she tends to her customers in a very friendly manner.  She works for a private company part time and as a seamstress in the afternoons.  She started this work when she saw her mother sew and realised that it could be profitable.  When she started, she had only one machine that she bought with an MFP loan and now her business is well under way.  She works alone.  She says that she thinks the work is profitable because it is generating a good income.  She provided her children with a good education and looked after them well.  She is able to pay her household bills but before starting this business, she did not have enough to do this.  She hopes to continue prospering, buy new machines and expand the business.  This, then, will be her seventh loan from MF and she is very happy to be able to count on the financial support that she receives, because this is what helped her business progress and what made her a businesswoman.  She has said that she is glad to be part of such a responsible group.  With the request for a loan of 1200 Nuevo Soles, Bertha will buy sewing materials such as material and elastic, among other things, to put into her business and to fulfill orders that she has taken.  She will buy all her materials in Lima where prices are cheaper when buying in bulk.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1258831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy material and elastic, among other things, for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T17:00:05Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":185.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":181.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":197.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":204.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":212.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":218.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.39,"local_amount":185.4,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":188.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189094},{"amount":71.66,"local_amount":181.05,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":183.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573040},{"amount":78.16,"local_amount":197.45,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":200.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122682},{"amount":81.07,"local_amount":204.81,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:43Z","rounded_local_amount":207.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868508},{"amount":84.1,"local_amount":212.45,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":215.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577339},{"amount":86.62,"local_amount":218.84,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":222.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529580}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T20:55:24Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":509122,"name":"Ingrid Sagrario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ingrid compr\u00f3 cajas de cervezas con las que surti\u00f3 su punto frio y vendi\u00f3, aumentando su utilidad con ese nuevo capital de trabajo.

loan.  Her first loan for 35,000 KGS was paid in full and on time.  Kiyal is 36 years old and has two children at home.  In 2004, while searching for a source of income for her family, Kiyal started her business selling vegetables with the starting sum of 2,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her perseverance and hard work, she was able to increase her monthly income to 15,000 som (KGS).  She doesn't have a large stock of products at this time, which is why she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  Kiyal plans on spending part of the proceeds from her loan on building materials to repair her home, and part to pay for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1257383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to increase her variety of goods on offer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kiyal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9121},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9181},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9403},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9630},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9863},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10101},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10345},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10595},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10851},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10910}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":193.82,"local_amount":9121,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":9183.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071301},{"amount":195.1,"local_amount":9181,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":9244.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459731},{"amount":199.81,"local_amount":9403,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":9467.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012496},{"amount":204.64,"local_amount":9630,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":9696.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754850},{"amount":209.59,"local_amount":9863,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9930.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458867},{"amount":214.64,"local_amount":10101,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10170.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863002},{"amount":219.84,"local_amount":10345,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":10416.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631533},{"amount":225.14,"local_amount":10595,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10667.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495418},{"amount":230.58,"local_amount":10851,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10925.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743655},{"amount":231.84,"local_amount":10910,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10985.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013876}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T23:59:27Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T09:55:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":508849,"name":"Mwanakombo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanakombo is a widow who is 32 years old.

and widowed with two children.  Her son works in Bishkek.  Uulbek's husband died suddenly.  They had started their business together, but after his death Uulbek was left alone with the children and all the household problems.  Despite all the troubles, Uulbek is still lively and cheerful.  She firmly believes in a bright future for her family.  Uulbek is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, which are the main sources of income for her family.  \n\nThanks to her perseverance and hard work, Uulbek was able to develop her business with 20,000 som (KGS) and now her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).  To further increase her business, Uulbek has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow and to get ready for the spring.  She plans to use the income from the loan to expand her tilled field and to increase her head of livestock.  Uulbek dreams that one day in the future her children will have good work and a good

","en":"Gulnara is 27 years old, married and has a wonderful son. Gulnara works with livestock breeding, which is their main source of income. After having started this business 7 years ago with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS), Gulnara was able to develop her business thanks to persistent work. The monthly income is in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Today the farm counts 4 cows, 4 horses and 10 sheep. Thanks to the income from the business, Gulnara can pay for the basic needs of the family. Gulnara sells milk and dairy products from her home. \n\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulnara turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of livestock. This will increase the amount of milk, and accordingly, the family's income. Gulnara plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business and in the future would like to realize her dream of purchasing a car.

is 56 years old and is married with eight children.  Her husband helps her around the house.  In search of a source of income for her family, Zairakan started her business raising animals in 1975 with a starting sum of 16,000 som (KGS).  Having successfully worked in areas like livestock and agriculture, Zairakan also grows fodder, which she uses to feed her animals.  She sells the extra fodder to supplement her family's income.  In addition to the fodder, Zairakan also grows wheat on her plot of land.  Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS.  To further increase her business, Zairakan has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners to ask for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy cows.  With the income from this loan, she plans on improving her family's standard of living.  Zairakan has told us that in the future she plans on paying for her younger son's education and improving the living conditions of her animals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1257416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

For the future development of her business, Gulmiyra has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy horses for resale.  Gulmiyra plans to use this income to improve her living conditions and to marry off her daughter in the near

Her experience goes back 22 years when she was making a living selling services and merchandise when she was employed as the manager of a boutique.\n\nThe idea for the business was her brother's, because her godfather had bought a store and had an empty space for her where she set up her own small-business venture, adapted the space, and bought display cases.  She added computers a little at a time and with her brother made them work.  Her customers are people from her neighborhood and other areas who know her and come to get the services and products she offers in her business.\n\nCurrently she's applying for her second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, her first Kiva loan.  She sells on credit and in cash, but the money she has isn't enough to meet demand in one of the most beautiful seasons.  Christmas and New Year are the reason for celebration and the getting together of families who usually spend their money in Marleny's business.\n\nWith the previous loan she stocked her business and increased sales.  Now she hopes to improve on her past result by taking advantage of demand to invest her Kiva loan in what people need: ink, paper products, Christmas items, pencils, packaged gifts, folders, pens, notebooks, pencils, and sweets--all the products she sells in her store.\n\nMarleny is directing all her efforts into improving her business and, with that, her income.  She dreams of having her own house in the future and of benefitting her entire family.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1257713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan with her husband.\r\n\r\nSince 2007 her husband has been running a DVD shop which is the only source of income for the family.

She has an excellent skill of making bangles. By selling handmade bangles, she helps her husband to meet the family's needs and her children's education expenses. She has been operating her business very efficiently and honestly for the past 20 years. Her clients always love her work and appreciate her a lot for her excellent skills.\r\n\r\nParveen, as a member of a six-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan. With the loan amount, she will be purchasing some material to make more variety of bangles. \r\n\r\nAs she is living in a rented house with her family, she dreams of building her own house. She also desires to increase her business and to provide a quality education for her children. Parveen and her family are very much thankful to both BRAC Pakistan and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1258461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase material to make a variety of bangles for her handmade bangles business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Rawalpindi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Parveen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gulshan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tasleem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madiha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":126000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":5684},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":12059},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":11281},{"due_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":9909},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12563},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":15240},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":13115},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":15146},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":16177},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":14826}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.62,"local_amount":5682,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-17T09:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5753.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331586818},{"amount":113.15,"local_amount":10967,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11105.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339471311},{"amount":111.54,"local_amount":10811,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10947.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347023987},{"amount":118.38,"local_amount":11473,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11617.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356461264},{"amount":129.62,"local_amount":12563,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12721.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364472953},{"amount":157.24,"local_amount":15240,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15432.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372877354},{"amount":135.31,"local_amount":13115,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":13280.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381648909},{"amount":156.27,"local_amount":15146,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":15337.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390511071},{"amount":166.9,"local_amount":16177,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":16381.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399759541},{"amount":152.97,"local_amount":14826,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T10:56:14Z","rounded_local_amount":15013.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410032466}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T22:23:24Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T10:56:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":508972,"name":"Mwanangano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanangano is a married woman with six children under her responsibility.

She lives with her partner, Cesar who is a salesperson, out of their union they have 3 children of 9, 6 and 4 years of age. She loves them very much and they live comfortably in their own home. Agueda works selling fast food like salchipapas (fried potatoes and sausages), juanes (a traditional chicken and rice meal) and other items. Everyday she prepares her fryer, along with her tables and chairs in the afternoons in a corner in a central area of the Manantay town. She kindly cares for her customers with the support of her partner and eldest son who help her prepare and in their free time.\r\n\r\n<p>Agueda enjoys her business since she gets enough income to pay the household expenses and support her partner. However, she gets tired of having to set up and take down her stall everyday, which is why she would like to be able to rent a place where everything will be ready for her to take care of her customers. She has looked at her profits and with the support of her partner, Agueda plans to rent a place and have more tables and chairs so her customers will be more comfortable. This will be her first loan with MFP that is why she hopes for a small loan to be able to realize her goals. Besides being in good standing with her communal bank, she has seen that it is a very united group and hopes that they will continue on the same path. With the 1000 nuevos soles she will buy tables and chairs as well as ingredients to prepare her food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1258961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy tables and chairs as well as ingredients to prepare her food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T21:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T21:00:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agueda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":150.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.06},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":177.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":181.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.32,"local_amount":150.8,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":154.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573051},{"amount":63.65,"local_amount":159.13,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":163.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122693},{"amount":66.03,"local_amount":165.06,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":169.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868519},{"amount":66.49,"local_amount":166.23,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":170.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577350},{"amount":70.97,"local_amount":177.42,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":181.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529590},{"amount":72.54,"local_amount":181.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":186,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974643}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T01:08:21Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":508871,"name":"Pelzi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pelzi is a 32-year-old man who is married with three children.

In his restaurant in addition to the Serbian community he also serves Albanians and other communities who live in Kosovo. He really enjoys what he does, since he has always liked to cook. He has many plans for his business, but for the time being, only wants to gather enough capital to expand it. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is requesting the loan in order to buy meat for his restaurant. Goran believes that the loan will help him to have more customers because he will have enough products to prepare different foods. In the future he hopes to hire another employee.

She is from Chinandega, a place located in the western part of the country. Chinandega is a place with people who are very welcoming, hard-working and responsible. Michael's economic activity is providing tailoring services. She has done this work for 5 years. She started it because of the need to have a source of income to support her small child, due to the lack of sources of steady work. In her business, she makes a range of garments such as shirts, skirts, pants, dresses, nightgowns and children's pajamas. Michael needs the loan to invest in working capital, buying tailoring supplies such as satin, fabrics, spools of thread, needles, lace, buttons, linings, ribbons, and oil. Michael is a very hard-working and responsible woman with a desire to grow as a person.

Estela works as a seamstress, a trade that she learned by studying in an occupational educational center as a young woman and has only recently returned to her work after a 10 year absence. She began with a sewing machine and at present has more than two machines for different finishes and her customers are satisfied and highly recommend her to other people.

However her age is a factor since it is a bit tiring being in the same position while sewing which is why with her earnings she hopes to invest in a small grocery store. This will be her first loan with MFP and hopes for a small loan to be able to meet her goals.

She\u2019s in a common-law relationship with Marco Antonio who is a transport driver. Together, they have 2 children: 14-year-old Cristian and 8 year-old Cristel. They live in their own house which they were able to buy after much effort. Alejandrina is in the fast food business, selling sausage and French fries, roast chicken and other foods. She works Monday to Friday in the evenings, very kindly attending her clients whom she receives and fulfills their demand. She is located in front of her sister\u2019s house with her sausage and French fries cart, a table and a few chairs. \r\nShe\u2019s had this business for more than 4 years. She started it with her own capital and until now has been running her business alone, being kind and cordial to clients. \r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because of the earnings she\u2019s made, as she sells everything she\u2019s prepared every day thanks to her customer service.\r\nShe likes that her location is a high-traffic area. She enjoys cooking and learned her mother\u2019s secrets for good seasonings. She enjoys her income as it allows her to pay her bills and household expenses. Although she is physically exhausted from waking up so early to prepare the day, she doesn\u2019t let that deter her as she continues running her business.\r\nThat\u2019s why she wants to expand her business. She\u2019d like to add tables and chairs in order to attend clients in a more comfortable setting. \r\nThis is her 6th loan with the MFP communal bank. She is grateful for the loans she has received to continue running her business. She\u2019d like to count on more loans and that\u2019s why she promises to be punctual with her payments. She feels comfortable with the communal bank and considers the members to be persons who are united and committed to their obligations.  \r\nWith the loan of 2000 Peruvian soles, she\u2019ll invest in buying a sausage and French fry cart for 600 Peruvian soles and the rest will go to buying supplies and ingredients to prepare foods in large quantities and at low costs. With that, she hopes she can welcome more clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1258979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy supplies and ingredients to prepare foods in large quantities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-18T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-17T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":301.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":330.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":332.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":354.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":362.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.62,"local_amount":301.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":309.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573057},{"amount":127.29,"local_amount":318.22,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":326.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122699},{"amount":132.04,"local_amount":330.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":338.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868525},{"amount":132.96,"local_amount":332.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":340.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577356},{"amount":141.92,"local_amount":354.8,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:07Z","rounded_local_amount":363.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529596},{"amount":145.17,"local_amount":362.92,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":372.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974649}],"funded_date":"2012-12-20T07:12:46Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":509184,"name":"Gustavo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gustavo, tiene 25 a\u00f1os, es un joven padre de familia muy amable, sencillo, trabajador y con la vitalidad que le impulsa a seguir adelante en el logro de sus metas, vive en casa de sus padres junto a su conviviente Mariela de 19 a\u00f1os y sus 2 queridos hijos, Ken de 4 y Andrea de 1 a\u00f1o de edad respectivamente, es por ellos que a diario trabaja arduamente ya que desea brindarles una mejor calidad de vida.

She bought this second-hand motorcycle for a low price with a loan she got from MFP a few months ago. She rents it out to a driver every day and in exchange charges a daily fee. Thanks to her permanent optimism and desire to excel, she bought a taxi a few years ago, which she also rents out as a public transportation vehicle used in the main streets of the city. Margarita has been doing this for 3 years and thanks to this activity her finances have improved and she could meet some of the needs she had at home. What she likes best about her business as a vehicle owner is that it allows her to generate income from home. The hardest part is having to wake up very early to get the day started, but she understands that in the medium term she will have the best results from her effort.

He is married and the father of two children, one boy and one girl, ages seventeen and nineteen years old. For a long time Nebojsa has worked in agriculture business. His wife is a teacher in a primary school. They all live in a minority community of Kosovo. To earn a living, Nebojsa works the agricultural land with his tractor for the others and for his land. \r\nNow Nebosa needs a loan for his tractor to repair his motor engine and to buy a seeder machine.

who appears in the picture, is a 25-year-old, married man. He is a father to one son. Adham is employed and gets a small salary which is not enough to cover his family's needs.\r\n\r\nAdham is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from Palestine for Credit & Development (FATEN) to cover the cost of purchasing a refrigerator and an oven for his house. Taking this loan will facilitate Adham's family's living conditions in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. \r\n\r\nIn order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see in fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. \r\n\r\nAs with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is also grateful to the lenders for their continued support toward her business. Some difficulties she faces are the low sales during the rainy season, and learning to sell from her friends. She is requesting this loan to purchase more children's slippers to increase her sales. Her plan for the future is to build a house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1258645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict

All the group members are considered hardworking people who very much want to get ahead. This group took out a loan of 210,000 YER. Fadhila is 25 years old, married, and has four children. She lives in Aden. She\u2019s actively a part of this, and she says that she\u2019s very happy because her business has improved little by little. She has been distributing mobile recharge cards. She started her business because she wanted to help her family with their children\u2019s expenses and to have her own money to cover any unexpected costs. She loves her work and aspires to continue it. For this reason, she\u2019s asking for a youth loan of 50,000 YER from AMB to continue buying mobile recharge cards, which will help her get more profit from her business.

She started a retail shop dealing mainly with clothes but later diversified to include household stuff and general merchandise due to slow business with the clothing. Norah has also attended youth entrepreneurship training organized by Technoserve, an international organization in its rural youth development program. From this training, Norah has learned business management, entrepreneurship development and personal finance skills which have improved her management skills a lot.\r\n\r\nNorah was introduced to the solar products through Brazafric's business linkages with Technoserve at a youth open day. She appreciates the benefits that accrue from the use of lanterns and with the Kiva financing option from Brazafric, Norah is seeking to purchase the solar products for stocking and reselling to her community. Norah highlights that she would also buy the solar lanterns so that she could increase her working hours at her shop.

","en":"Guljan is 51 years old and has 5 children. Guljan's eldest three children are grown up and work in Moscow. Her remaining daughter and son are students. By nature, Guljan is a level-headed and hardworking person. She has already worked for many years as a librarian in a local library. Her librarian salary is very low, which is why in 1997, in search of a source of income for her family, Guljan began her animal husbandry business with an initial investment of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her perseverance and hard work, Guljan was able to develop her business to generate a monthly profit of 15,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this, Guljan is preparing to marry off her son and needs to expand her agricultural business in order to increase her family's income. Guljan approached the company \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase 4 heifers. In the future, with the help of the cows, she can increase her milk production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1258144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase young cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balasary village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guljan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":30206.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458871},{"amount":850,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40275.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743659},{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":30206.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426726}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T05:29:33Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":509063,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is married and has one child.

Betty is very hard working, social, and honest. She will use the loan to purchase more maize and to set up a store where she can always store her produce and be able to have a constant supply. The loan will allow her to be able to earn a consistent and stable income to support her family and educate her children up to higher institutions of learning. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1258708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase maize to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rubaga Road","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shamim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jimmy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Goliath","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":950000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":950000,"processed_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":954944.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339635448},{"amount":358.34,"local_amount":950000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":954944.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347362431},{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":950000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":954944.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589647},{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":950000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":954944.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993609},{"amount":226.81,"local_amount":601322,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":604451.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040325},{"amount":294.96,"local_amount":781994,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":786063.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381830959},{"amount":155.27,"local_amount":411649,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":413791.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689770},{"amount":7.37,"local_amount":19544,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":19645.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880280},{"amount":32.26,"local_amount":85491,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85935.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459234068}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T10:34:03Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":509059,"name":"Mwanahamisi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanahamisi is 53 years old and is the mother of five children.

is a married man, age 45, who has four children. All of them are school going. He is a produce dealer (maize and beans). He does both the growing and selling. He started this in 2007, in order to increase the family income so that he can educate the children.\r\n\r\nYoweri wants a loan of 500,000 UGX to add produce to the business, since the season is on and demand is high. His major customers are residents of his area and its outskirts, where he operates the business. He hopes that, if given this loan, he will be able to expand the business and use the profits to improve the living standard of the family.

At the moment, Aigul has one cow and one horse on her farm. For the further development of her business, Aigul approached the company \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase a milk cow.

He is married with four children between the ages of 5 and 21 years old. Three of his children are currently attending school. He began this business because he did not go to school.\r\n\r\nAlie sells local foodstuff. He sells pepper, palm oil and gari. He has been running this business for 25 years. He works at the business every day from morning to night. His business is the only income he has. He says that the main challenge to his business is insufficient capital to run his business.\r\n\r\nAlie has requested a loan in order to buy more local foodstuff like pepper, palm oil and gari to expand his business.

She is married and has two children, aged 17 and 13 years. One is a school-going child. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her because she assists in his schooling and accommodation.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Adiza established her clothing and home product business, which sells shirts, jeans, nappies, knickers, wrappers, towels, powder, bedspreads, creams, and other products. She began her business because she stopped schooling in Class V and has a health problem. She used to assist her mother in operating her business. She later married a contractor who established a small business stall for her. Working six days a week and nine hours a day, she earns about Le 1,950,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nAdiza would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000. She has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase jeans (eight dozen @ Le 360,000); skirts (five dozen @ Le 300,000); and blouses (10 pieces @ Le 12,000).

She is married to a contractor and has four children aged 16, 14, 12, and nine years. All are school going children. In 1996, Isatu B. established her baby clothing and utensils business. She began her business because she came from a poor background; she had to do petty trading after school hours to pay her school fees. Things got harder for her because she had to drop out of school. She was peddling everyday to help her parents and younger ones. She then got married and her husband helped her with a small amount of funds for the business. Since then, she has developed gradually. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 5,481,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nIsatu would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Isatu B has already received and successfully repaid two loans. She now requires a new loan in order to purchase baby powder - 10 dozen @ Le180,000, Baby clothing - 10 dozen @ Le180,000, Baby oil (small size) - 4 dozen @ Le100,000, Flask - 20 pieces @ Le150,000.She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 830,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Isatu B. plans to open a shop and educate her children. The loan will help as it is an additional business capital. Isatu serves about 30 customers per day including women and petty traders around town and villages. Her business is popular because she always has good customer care and good quality goods at affordable prices. She usually travels by vehicle three times in the month to Freetown, and Conakry once every two months to purchase her goods. She saves some of her profit and uses some as an additional capital for the business.  \r\n\r\nShe has enough savings now that she has acquired a piece of land which she is looking forward to developing. She is also planning to expand her business by acquiring more loans and saving enough of her profit. She is hard working and competitive. Isatu B wants to achieve her dreams by educating her children through acquiring subsequent loans.

He is asking for a Kiva loan, his first through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will acquire plans offered by phone service providers.

In this village, there is a separate hamlet called the Mahar community. The main source of livelihood of this community is weaving bamboo baskets. In the year 2010, six poor, illiterate rural women of this hamlet formed a Joint Liability Group named Jaya Ram with the objective of taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the overall development of their family and the improvement of their existing businesses. Basanta, about 43 years old, is the featured member who is sitting in the middle with her hand raised. She is married and resides in a small hut with her husband, one son age 15 and one daughter age 12. Her children are continuing their studies. All members of this group belong to a very poor background far away from all basic needs like education, shelter, health facilities etc.  \r\n\r\nThe business of Basanta (weaving bamboo baskets) is a traditional business in her community. Basanta and her husband do the processing work and weave baskets of different shapes and sizes. They sell their products in the nearest weekly market in their town. Some traders also regularly come to this village to purchase bamboo products. Basanta earns a monthly profit of Rs 2,000\/- from her business. As there is a growing demand for these products to supply to various parts of the country, Basanta wants to purchase more raw bamboo with this loan amount to work for a longer period without any interruption for more output. This will help her to earn some extra income to manage the family smoothly. Basanta hopes to construct a house in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Udia, Sushama, Balamati, Tarulata and Subidha who are doing similar businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1258753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase raw bamboo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Mahulpada,Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T06:40:01Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Udia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balamati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tarulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subidha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":74000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":74000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T10:47:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":509214,"name":"Rugiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, Rugiatu earns about 2,980,000 Sierra Leonean leone (Le) every month from this business.

In 2008, Osman Malam established his bags (school bags, traveling bags, casual bags) business. He began his business because as a teenager he was farming with his parents in the village because of his poor background; he was not fortunate enough to attend school. When he grew older, he decided to start a petty trading business. His father wanted him to be a farmer, but he had to leave the village for the main town because farming does not yield any profit. He was dealing local produce. In 2008, he changed his business into bags. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 606,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000. Osman Malam has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy school bags - 50 pieces @ Le25,000, traveling bags - 50 pieces @ Le35,000, casual bags - 30 pieces @ Le15,000, and computer bags - 15 pieces @ Le70,000. In the future, Osman Malam hopes to sponsor his children's education. The loan will help as it is the source of income. The rainy season is a problem as it reduces sales. He is hard working. He has successfully paid the previous loan and he will make sure he repays this loan in order to acquire subsequent loans.

Manju is married and resides in a small mud house with her six family members: her husband, three sons (19, 15 and 5 years old) and one daughter (10 years old). All members of this group are below the poverty line. The Mahar community to which Manju belongs, has a separate hamlet in her village.  \r\n\r\nManju runs a business weaving bamboo baskets, which is the traditional business of her community. Manju and her family do the processing work and weaving of baskets like \u201ckula, tupa, kurli, bhuga, kulei, garna, talei, parla etc.\" in different sizes. During the marriage season, there is a heavy demand for these products. They sell the products once a week in the weekly market in the nearby town. Some traders also regularly come to this village to purchase bamboo products. Manju earns a monthly profit of Rs 2,500\/- from her business. To meet the growing demand for these products, Manju wants to purchase more raw bamboo with his loan to work for a longer period without any interruption. She also wants to procure some ready-made products from other weavers. This will help her to earn some extra income to bear the regular expenses of her family in a smooth manner and to materialize her future hope of constructing a house.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Nira, Pushpa, Baidehi and Lalita who are doing similar businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n

52 years old, lives with his wife and niece in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His daughter has passed away so he and his wife care for her child. He has been running a candy and sweets business since 1998 at a local market. He takes his goods from wholesale food centers. Also he has retired from the police organization and gets a pension. Due to diabetes, his left leg has been replaced with an artificial leg, but he has still difficulty walking and uses a crutch. He is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase an automobile which runs on electricity and emits less smoke. As winter comes to Mongolia, the air in Ulaanbaatar is greatly polluted and encouraging the usage of environmentally friendly cars is essential in reducing air pollution. Issuing this loan to the borrower means he can work enthusiastically and also more importantly it will contribute to environmental protection.

Kanak, sitting on the extreme left wearing a sky colored sari and holding turmeric powder, is the featured member. She is 29 years of age and lives with her husband and one daughter who is three years old.\r\n\r\nKanak is running a unit processing forest produce like turmeric, arrowroot, honey, mustard and jhuna. Her husband helps in her business and collects the forest produce from different places in the state and outside the state. After collection, Kanak processes the raw products, makes packets and supplies them to the retailers. She has also tied her business with a govt.agency called ORMAS and sold them at a lump sum for a high margin of profit. Her husband also used to go to different district and state level festivals where there is a congregation of persons to purchase her finished products by hiring a stall. Her monthly net income from the processing unit is around 12,000 INR.There is a heavy demand for her products but due to lack of funds, she could not meet the demands of the market. So with the present loan, Kanak planned to procure a bulk quantity of forest products for processing and selling in the market to earn more profit. She has a dream of providing better education to her child and constructing a house of her own in due course.  \r\n \r\nThe other three members of her group are Hasina, Gitanjali and Snehalata.

In this way she manages to provide for her children. To cope with the increasing demand of her customers, she needs to purchase a new tailoring machine. But due to the lack of money, she is unable to purchase it. \n\nTherefore, as a member of seven-person lending group, Nazi has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to cover the cost of purchasing a new tailoring machine. In this way, she will be able to complete the orders on time. \n\nNazi intends to utilize part of the profits on the betterment of her family members and on providing quality education to her

years old. She is a very caring mother and tries to provide good living conditions for her 2 children. Several years ago, Davlatoy went to Russia in order to earn a living, but was unable to find suitable work and returned home, where she found work at a farm. For the past 6 months, she has been milking cows and capably taking care of all her work responsibilities.\r\n\r\nDavlatoy would like to have a cow of her own in order to provide her children with fresh milk.
