This is 39-year-old Anna A. Nyengella from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has three children between the ages of 10 and 16. Anna has been in business as a food-seller since 2004. She buys crops from farmers at a low price and sells them in the city at higher price.She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Anna currently earns about $350 from her business. She is requesting a loan of $750 to purchase rice, maize and beans. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and range of the goods.  Anna thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Khalifa, 52, is married and has four children. He lives in Djabbar Rasulov district and works with his family in the agricultural industry. Many years ago he decided to begin to cultivate land that he owned. He did so to generate more income that would enable him to support his family. \r\n\r\nAt the same time Khalifa raises cattle near his house. He will use the loan money to buy young cattle to raise.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future, she wants to complete construction of her house, and have more employees under her.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":578388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Tools, tubes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Duran (Primavera)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-08-04T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":53.74},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":57.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":61.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.68},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.74,"local_amount":53.74,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":53.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846003},{"amount":55.26,"local_amount":55.26,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":55.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112274},{"amount":56.36,"local_amount":56.36,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":56.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405684},{"amount":57.57,"local_amount":57.57,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":57.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544154},{"amount":59.19,"local_amount":59.19,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680909},{"amount":60.28,"local_amount":60.28,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":60.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379242},{"amount":61.68,"local_amount":61.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":61.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797226},{"amount":63.55,"local_amount":63.55,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":63.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239399},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":64.58,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":64.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206105849},{"amount":67.79,"local_amount":67.79,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":67.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211862616}],"funded_date":"2010-08-04T07:50:08Z","paid_date":"2011-06-20T07:52:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":224070,"name":"Ishdorj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Ishdorj is 29 years old, and lives with his wife, 5 year old daughter, and 4 month old son, in his mother's house in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city.\r\n\r\nHe owns a small car, and has been running a taxi business for five years.

She is 46 years old. Daniela is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Daniela owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling and dealing daily use products such as shampoo, soap and baby powder in the local community. Daniela has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Daniela joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Daniela is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Daniela from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She, together with her husband and children, manage the household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nAgnes operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings when all the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of time and money to spend cooking gas and food for only one to two people when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. \r\n\r\nAgnes' regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day. To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 17,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to buy more products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAgnes dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own restaurant. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":920963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Beatrice will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Sawa SHG group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nBeatrice is pictured with her group members.

Every weekend she goes off to look for the supplies and prepares the worn out wood and branches along with recycled paper. From this she makes a type of dough that eventually is turned into the small incense sticks which she then covers in silk paper of various colors. Thanks to her hard work she can support her small son, as she is a single mother and yearns for him to become a very useful and successful man in society. Abelinda\u2019s work routine is very active. After she makes the incense, she goes away on a trip every 15 days to the capital city of her country, where also she sells, pots during certain seasons. The items she offers for sale, she does so using a lay-away and\/or credit based process. Eighteen years ago, by advice of her beloved brother, she began selling these articles and December and October are the months which she has the most demand. Now she must take advantage of her high demand and wishes to continue doing so motivated by the gain that it brings in with the purpose of settling down in a central place to sell her products. She is requesting a loan to buy her inventory and more merchandise for this upcoming Christmas season.  Abelinda is requesting our help to fulfill each one of her plans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":93719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious Articles","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Compra de insumos para la fabricaci\u00f3n de sahumerios.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-12-06T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-21T00:25:41Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119554},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-02-21T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139639},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-03-21T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":162777},{"amount":86,"local_amount":245.71,"processed_date":"2008-04-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":256.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188048}],"funded_date":"2007-12-07T00:25:41Z","paid_date":"2008-04-21T09:11:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30671,"name":"Sun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sun C., 22, is married and works as a housewife cooking food and looking after her little four children.

When she received her first loan of PHP 3,000, she used some of it to buy fertilizer and the balance she used to buy milled rice to resell, which enabled her to have a cash flow to pay for her weekly dues. \r\n\r\nOn her third loan, she bought a breeding sow and farmed out the piglets to her neighbors to raise, splitting the profits with them. Now she has five breeding sows and her arrangement with her neighbors has proven to be a lucrative venture for all involved. Over the years, she expanded her farming venture and her rice business continues to flourish. Inez is such a dedicated member that she has won the best member award several times. \r\n\r\nNow on her 14th loan, Inez is borrowing PHP 18,000 to buy seeds to grow on her farm.\r\n\r\nAs a single woman, Inez is working hard while she is able so that she will be financially secure and independent in her golden years.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, Inez is shown standing on the drying platform of newly harvested rice, which is usually sun-dried before it is sent to the rice mill.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women.

Because her children are poor, in economic terms, Lolita as a mother couldn\u2019t do anything but support them in her own little way. Unforntanely, while busying herself supporting them she lost control of her business. Despite that failure, she still feels happy that her business has helped her children and their families. Moreover, she was able to pay back the whole loan she received from ASHI for that business and now she is able to request another loan to begin a new business, which is hog\/pig fattening.\r\n\r\nFor Lolita, hog fattening is sort of like saving money in a pig. Indeed after four months of fattening, the pig will be sold (either slaughtered or alive) and by then her capital will have produced a small profit. Once she raises more pigs and sells more, her profits will be doubled along with her capital. With that, Lolita is hopeful that someday she can afford to support the higher education of her grand-children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":502284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase pigs for fattening and selling.

He taught before that; he is a teacher by profession.  In his retirement he looked for a more tranquil job.\r\n\r\nHis job is now more intense because of the field work.  He generally invests his money in planting alfalfa and corn.  He later rents his fields to his customers, who are alfalfa merchants.   That is the way that his earnings allow him to keep supporting his family.  He also has plans to improve and expand his crops.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  He pledges to be very responsible with his payments.  He is grateful to the people who made this loan possible.  It will be very useful to the progress of his business.

She runs a pharmaceutical business. She owns one small pharmaceutical kiosk and sells medications to retail clients. She launched this business eight years ago. \r\n\r\nMarhabo is seeking a loan of 7,500 TJS to purchase assorted pharmaceuticals for the cold season, when viruses, cold and flu lead to increased spending on medications. \r\n\r\nHer business is the main source of income for the family and her husband is also actively involved in the business. She is hoping to continue to develop her business one day by opening several more pharmaceutical kiosks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Gradually she added other merchandise according to what her customers suggested and with her first Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo loan she bought a display case giving the appearance of a sales point just like she\u2019d planned because she bought display cases and stocked them with stationery items since her main market were mothers of the children she cares for in a group home, or placement that the national government offers to women who have been previously trained, to support the nourishment and care of small children in the community so that their parents can work and the children will be well cared for, educated and fed nutritionally.  \r\n\r\nIn Marggi\u2019s case, she\u2019s been a \u201ccommunity mother\u201d for 14 years, an activity that has provided many opportunities because she\u2019s met suppliers of food to the group homes with whom she\u2019s negotiated contracts like the one she now has to supply 512 welfare homes with foods derived from wheat flour.  Because of this, aware from the beginning of this opportunity, she bought basic bakery equipment like a kneader and an oven, she hired a baker and leased a locale with many bakery tools which solved her initial problem of productive capacity which she now enjoys and through which she earns income and the opportunity of the previously mentioned contract.\r\n\r\nThis is the second financing with

From childhood he was interested in the farming business. He has worked in his farming business for 5 years and is very happy with the support of his friendly family. In his business, he gets help from his father, mother, brother and his sister.\r\n\r\nManuchehr has been advised to use agricultural supplies such as fertilizers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Recently, most of his clients (students) study in schools and universities, so Abdulqader's business faces a financial challenge leading to a decrease in his profit. As well, the current bad situation in Yemen also leads to his business being closed.

Sus 20 a\u00f1os de experiencia le indican cada d\u00eda lo que tiene que hacer en sus ventas, ya que su negocio lo inici\u00f3 desde el a\u00f1o 1992, cuando aprendi\u00f3 de su cu\u00f1ado la actividad comercial en la que hoy trabaja.  Con su negocio genera el sustento de su familia, conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 3 hijos, hoy en las edades de 16, 17 y 35 a\u00f1os. En su local vende principalmente de contado y trabaja de lunes a domingo en un horario extendido, desde las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la tarde; Luis realiza sus compras de contado en f\u00e1bricas  especializadas y vende en diversas comunidades de la ciudad, adem\u00e1s del barrio donde habita y tiene su negocio.  Su meta es ampliar el surtido pues cada vez mas, crece su clientela y en \u00e9pocas como el \u00faltimo trimestre del a\u00f1o, es aun mas amplio el pedido de mercanc\u00edas, porque sus clientes compran en esta temporada, debido a que tienen dinero reunido producto de su trabajo, de bonificaciones y primas laborales y esto hace que aumente la frecuencia de sus compras varias veces a la semana. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, pues desea comprar en mayor volumen y disminuir esta frecuencia, para generar menos gastos de transporte y mejores posibilidades de obtener descuentos. Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n de \u00e9xito al solicitar el presente credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 mecedoras y sillas tejidas, productos de miscel\u00e1neas y papeler\u00eda navide\u00f1a.

","en":"Luis, 61 years old, has a general store. His main products include arts and crafts, such as rocking chairs, normal chairs, paper products, feminine products, and domestic accessories. His 20 years of experience allows him to know what he should sell every day, since his business started in 1992. He learned from an early age the activities that he now does for a living.\r\n\r\nWith his business, he sustains his family, made up of his spouse and their three kids, today of ages 16, 17, and 35 years. In his location, he principally does business in cash, and works from Monday to Sunday with a schedule that extends from 7am to 6pm. Luis makes his sales in cash for specialized fabrics and sells in various communities of the city, in addition to the neighborhood that he lives in and where he has his business. His goal is to increase his assortment of goods and his customer base more and more. In times such as the final trimester of the year, the demand for goods is even higher, because his customers buy more at this time.

He had been working there many years and his pay was very low and his family was growing. So he decided to open his own business. He began the business in March of 1987, thanks to his cousin who offered to sell his Hot Dog cart. From the very beginning, it went well, and currently Daniel has three carts. His oldest daughter is in charge of one, and he takes care of the others. He currently only sells during the weekends, as during the week he sells natural products in nearby towns. \r\n\r\nHe needs this loan for MXN 4000, which he will repay in 10 installments, to buy raw materials and disposable products so that he can continue to sell his Hot Dogs and hamburgers and in order to give better service to his customers by having all the necessary ingredients. <br

They are diverse like people themselves. Different people have different ordeals. It is believed that strong people have more difficult ordeals. However, steadfastness and hope for better always help people to live through them. Besides, there are always people around us who are there to support us in difficult moments. Those are our parents, closest relatives and friends. \r\n\r\nThe leader of this group, Nazgul, a 28-year-old young woman, deserves to be called a strong woman. The ordeal that awaited her was divorce after a few years of happy marriage. The expectations of cozy and agreeable married life did not come true. Instead, after divorce actually took place, she was left with two children to raise and uncertainty about life in the future.  Nazgul wisely viewed things in a sensible light. She talked to her parents and they agreed to help her look after her five\u2013year-old son and three\u2013year-old daughter while Nazgul is at work as a hospital nurse.  Her parents have also given her some sheep for breeding and so animal husbandry became Nazgul\u2019s second occupation. Although she only earns about $95 per month, she can always sell some of her cattle to satisfy her family's needs.  Nazgul wants to increase the total population of her cattle and is therefore requesting a loan to buy a calf. <p>\r\n\r\nThere are three partners in Nazgul\u2019s group:<p>\r\n\r\nAsigul, 60, has raised four children and is married to a vice principal of music college. Asigul is a housewife who keeps some cattle and needs a loan to buy a cow.<p>\r\n\r\nBurulbu, 59, has one son, a boxing trainer. and a retired husband.  For a living, Burulbu raises livestock and sells milk. She hopes to obtain a loan to buy a cow. <p>\r\n\r\nKuljamal, 56, a mother of five children, is married to a shepherd. Kuljamal stays at home and looks after cattle and sells milk. She has applied for this loan to buy a milk cow. <p>\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Thus he has many customers who even make a purchase of his products straight from his house.\r\n\r\nToday Rahmatullo has great demand for his goods and that is why he wants to take an individual loan. He has requested a loan of 13,000 Somoni to add to his working capital to allow him to purchase more inventory.\r\n\r\nRahmatullo is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nIMON International believes his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

farms and he has a car. In free time he engages in the service of providing a taxi. He is married and has four children. He mainly deals with cultivation of wheat, grapes and seedlings. Several times he received a loan from Imon International and he likes our services. He wants to continue cooperating with Imon International. Farrukh would like to get a loan of 5,000 TJS for purchasing of mineral fertilizers and payment of workers. Farrukh wishes to expand his business and hopes that the lenders will support him.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Cheese is sold to local dairy products retailers. \r\n\r\nLili requested credit for transportation of her livestock to the summer pasture in a family-owned farm in a mountainous part of the region and take them back to the village after three months. With the borrowed amount she will pay to truck them and also supply some food for her sons, who will stay in the mountain farm to take care of the livestock. After the summer months the livestock will be returned to the village. Their productivity will significantly increase during and after mountain pasturing, as a result of much more fertile grass in the mountains. During the summer months, Lili\u2019s sons will produce cheese in their summer farm and sell it there to retailers, who have already agreed with the family on the purchase of the product. \r\n\r\nThe increase in the cows\u2019 productivity and sale of cheese will raise the income of the family.

She is married to Epifanio, a overseas contract worker. They have four children, two in college while the others are still in high school and elementary school. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nBaby Ruth operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. She rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a Php 29,000 loan. She will use it to buy new computer units, spare parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as it expands. \r\n\r\nBaby Ruth hopes to renovate her house in the province and dreams to be able to give her children a good future and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and were she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":876968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Atukuzwe thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":256016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials such as kanga and vitenge","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Atukuzwe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:05:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436414},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130686},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027483},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613484},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010563}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T18:33:42Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Napier","image":null}},{"id":88070,"name":"Alex","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alex is 40-years-old and is married with four children.

She lives in a rented room with her sister Maximiliana, aged 35, who helps her in her business.\r\n<p>\r\nThe La Rinconada mine, which is located in Ananea (district of Juliaca), is situated at over 5000 meters (16400 feet) above sea level. It is here that Eusebia owns a soft toys store. It is a very popular store, especially with lovers who look for a nice present to their sweetheart. Eusebia buys her toys in Tacna and Desaguadero, which are border cities and offer a wider range of products. She is very happy when she finds out that one of her soft toys was gladly received by the loved one, which she easily gets to know since her village is very small. She has been running this store for four years and the hardest is to endure the intense cold in the mine which often makes her sick and prevents her from working normally. Her greatest wish for the near future is to have a larger store in which she can provide a better service to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Eusebia\u2019s fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She knows that she must pay her installments in time and not cause problems to the members of her community bank who love her team spirit. Eusebia will use her 2000 nuevos soles to buy more soft toys and increase the inventory in her store.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":358535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-26T12:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":341.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212064},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":341.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641648},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":341.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081088},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":341.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997238},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":341.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842582},{"amount":113.06,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":343.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734158}],"funded_date":"2009-07-26T16:48:32Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":129040,"name":"Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Carmen, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLas Brisas\u201d, Distrito D.

For nearly 34 years, she has lived in the Gb\u00e9gamey district of Cotonou. Married to Luc Aniambossou, an agent for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 B\u00e9ninoise de Brasserie, Aline has five children, three of whom are her own. Aline never had the opportunity to go to school, but all five of the children are in school. The couple shares responsibility for the family's expenses. For 10 years, Aline has sold beverages (beer and soft drinks of all types) as well as rice and fabrics in the Marina refreshment area in Cotonou. Aline buys these products at Dantokpa, the international market of Benin. Aline has already received two loans that she repaid in full to Alid\u00e9. Aline would like to keep up with customer demand more and take care of her children's needs with no problems. Sometime in the future she would like to purchase and build on a plot of land with the money made from selling her products.

Carmen has high hopes for her children, and with profits from her loans, she is confident that they will receive a great education and attain a step up in their lives.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

She and her husband, Namazbekom, are raising three children. In 2004, the couple started a business in the meat trade, using 10,000 soms (KGS) as seed capital. Because she was able to develop her business and find regular customers, Gulzat now has average income of 6,000-7,000 soms (KGS). Thanks to the hard work they put into their business, the couple were able to begin construction on a large house for the family.\r\n\r\nIn order to further improve and expand her business, Gulzat turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy thirty head of sheep and goats. With income from the loan, Gulzat plans to complete construction on her house and save money for university tuition for her children.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

She sells and buys recyclables since more than 15 years ago. Thanks to this job and to the help of her husband she could raise and educate her children, as well as improve her home with basic commodities. Francisca, comments that this job of buying and selling recyclables is very complex because one needs to be a quick assessor; when her neighbors come and sell her the products she needs to value and quote on the spot. Francisca and her husband are hard-working dynamic people. They are early risers, they start their working day very early, because of this they sell their products in the main recycling plants of the city. The previous loans that she got from Fundacion Paraguaya were invested in the purchase of a scale and for the enlargement of the floor in her backyard to store the products. Now, she is asking for a loan so she can buy more recyclables such as irons, plastics, and cartons. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Ana Escalante, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Francisca tiene 48 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada y tiene 2 hijos, se dedica a la actividad de vender y comprar art\u00edculos reciclables hace m\u00e1s de 15 a\u00f1os y gracias a  \u00e9ste  trabajo y con la ayuda de su marido pudo mantener y educar a sus hijos, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n pudo dotar  las comodidades m\u00ednimas a su casa.\r\nFrancisca, comenta que \u00e9ste oficio de comprar y vender \u00e9stos art\u00edculos es muy complejo ya que uno debe ser un tasador veloz, porque los vecinos de la zona se acercan a su domicilio a ofrecerle los art\u00edculos  y en el momento debe cotizar y pagar por la compra.\r\nTanto, Francisca, como su marido, son personas trabajadoras y muy din\u00e1micas, ya que se levantan a muy tempranas horas para iniciar su jornada laboral, debido a que estos productos  ellos los venden a las principales f\u00e1bricas de la ciudad.\r\nLos pr\u00e9stamos que obtuvo anteriormente de la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya los ha invertido en la compra de una b\u00e1scula, y tambi\u00e9n en la ampliaci\u00f3n del piso de su patio para almacenar sus mercader\u00edas.

She and her husband started this small business 29 years ago, and it has been the main source of income for their family. Her husband augments their family income by hiring out their family owned tricycle, a motorcycle with a sidecar attachment, to shuttle passengers around the town especially when demand for Oysters is low. At present their gross family income is around PHP12,800 or approximately $275\/month. \r\n\r\nThe fish pen and the oyster farm has sustained her family over the years. Now one of her daughters is a teacher in a private high school, which helps, but she needs the loan of PHP 17,000 or $375 to repair and expand their oyster beds and fish pen so that it could gain enough income to also support her adult son whom she has invited to help in the business.\r\n\r\nThis is Diomema's 11th consecutive loan with Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation's Project Dungganon.

She is 54 years old and lives with her husband and her son Walter (age 28) in their own home located south of the city of Lima.\r\n<p>\r\nEvery morning from Monday through Friday, she is in charge of selling passenger tickets and attracting customers for her public transport minibus, which is driven by her husband.  She wakes up very early and has breakfast by 5:30am since people travel more frequently between the hours of 6am to 10am.  Nelida enjoys helping her husband in this activity because other assistants they have hired have either undercharged on the travel fare or ran off with all of the money.  In light of these occurrences, she decided to become her husband\u2019s permanent assistant.  She has worked in this position for ten years and also manages the expenses related to the vehicle.  Nelida enjoys what she does, but she has had problems with her voice because of the constant shouting necessary to attract customers and identify travel routes.  However, she continues to perform her job with great affection.  In the future, she hopes to finish building her house.  Her family lives in a rental home while the construction takes place.

Violeta T., 57, knows this, and gives her best to accomplish the goals she has set for her and her family. She finished her high school studies and is married to Esteban T., 58, a jeepney driver. They have been blessed with one child,  who is currently in the third year level of her high school education.  Together, they live in  Paroloa, Tondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nVioleta helps her husband earn a living by managing a banana-que stand where she also sells packed meals which she cooks herself. Banana-que stands are popular in many different corners of Manila. Banana-que is a delicious saba banana, deep fried and coated with caramelized brown sugar.  This is one of the best Filipino comfort foods.  \r\n\r\nVioleta earns income by buying a variety of ripe bananas and selling them piece by piece with a minimum mark up.  Early in the morning, she also cooks the viands which are commonly used in Filipino breakfasts, packs them into Php 15-20 packets, and sells them to her neighbors and patrons in the community.  With these businesses, she is able to earn a minimum of Php 700.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she would like to request a loan for Php 8,000. She will use this fund to buy more goods and raw materials needed for her banana-que stand and packed meals business. With the help of this loan, she will be able to continue her business and increase her earning capacity as a micro entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nVioleta learns the value of improving one\u2019s business, and thus works to innovate hers. She does not emphasize any problem she encounters, but rather focuses on its solution. Goals cannot be met simply by identifying the problem, but by acting on them. One of the most important goal she has in mind is to support her child until college graduation, at which point she will feel most fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAs CCT community partner, she faithfully attends to their weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":702429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has her own recipe that she describes in this video. She has two employees who help her distribute the juice by going door to door in town. Beryl is a 28-year-old single mother of two children, aged 6 and 4, who, she says, adore her. The challenges she faces are paying her employees when business is slow.<P>\r\n\r\nIn addition, Beryl says the weather has cooled down here in Kisumu, where the temperature on the day we interviewed her hovered around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Beryl hopes to use the loan to open up her own canteen where she can serve her juices. This will allow her to stay closer to home while at the same time not having to run her business out of where she lives. She also hopes to employ more people. When asked if men or women make better entrepreneurs, she says women, a common refrain amongst our borrowers. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Beryl saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Beryl responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end,  you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

Three years ago, they decided as a family to earn their own income independently. So, they began to transport passengers in the car that they bought. Every day they work, offering taxi services. Her husband is the driver and Elsa takes care of the income and expenses of the business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, she has started to sell clothing, which she offers to the passengers and to other taxi drivers. In this way, the couple has seen that their income is improving.
