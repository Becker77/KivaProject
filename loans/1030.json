She is a very caring mother and tries to provide good living conditions for her 2 children. Several years ago, Davlatoy went to Russia in order to earn a living, but was unable to find suitable work and returned home, where she found work at a farm. For the past 6 months, she has been milking cows and capably taking care of all her work responsibilities.\r\n\r\nDavlatoy would like to have a cow of her own in order to provide her children with fresh milk. Her children were very happy to hear their mother's plan. However, Davlatoy's salary is insufficient for such a purchase, and so she is requesting a loan of 3000 somoni to buy a cow. Davlatoy is a return client of IMON International, and promises to repay her loan on time. This loan will help her to improve her children's nutrition and ensure their healthy growth. Davlatoy is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1258360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gissar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.524722 68.551389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T09:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T09:00:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Davlatoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":207.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":219.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":230.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":225.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":243.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":244.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":249.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":261.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":267},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":275.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":283.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":292.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.99,"local_amount":207.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":214.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740952},{"amount":47.57,"local_amount":219.55,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":226.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056251},{"amount":50.59,"local_amount":233.47,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":241.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801948},{"amount":48.46,"local_amount":223.68,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":230.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510193},{"amount":52.74,"local_amount":243.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":251.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915478},{"amount":52.99,"local_amount":244.58,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":252.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693188},{"amount":352.66,"local_amount":1627.65,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1680.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390555993}],"funded_date":"2012-12-20T00:04:31Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":509275,"name":"Tam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tam is 41 years old, and married with two children.

He is 28 years old, married, and has two children, Nekruz and Lailo, who are 2 and 4 years old.  His wife is a homemaker and so he is the only breadwinner for the family.  Umarali received a higher education thanks to his parents and for more than eight years he has been a high school teacher of literature and their native language.   He really loves his profession and takes pleasure from his work.  His students are eager for every lesson because he makes them very interesting.\r\n\r\nUmarali earns a small salary and cannot save up money for buying furniture.

Nasirat began her business with 5,000 som (KGS) in 1998 and has been able to develop her business to where she now has six cows and ten sheep, which bring her a monthly profit of 10,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and cattle.  She fattens the cattle and sells them at the local cattle market.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her business, Nasirat applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy additional head of cattle.

She is a woman of good taste and she has a kind heart.  Her husband died young, leaving her with one son.  She raised her son alone, married him off, and now she has two grandsons.  To earn an income and help his mother, Muhabatkhon's son went to work in the Russian Federation.  However, he doesn't send any money to the family.  Having not received any money from her son, Muhabatkhon decided to start her own business in processing apricot kernels.  With this goal in mind, she studied in a course called \"Achieve Success\" that is organized by the Association of Business Women and she received a graduation certificate.  She now has business-related skills.\r\n\r\nShe will buy apricot kernels, clean them with a special machine, and then sell them at the local market.  Her daughter-in-law will help her with the business.  She plans to use the income she earns to provide her grandsons and daughter-in-law with all the necessities of life.  She is requesting a loan of 4,500 somoni to buy the machine for cleaning the apricot kernels so she can start her business.  She is relying on your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1258445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married to Paul, a seaman, and is a mother.   Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business.  She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLaylanie operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  Her income is generated by getting supplies at wholesale prices, and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLaylanie hopes to have a happy and peaceful life.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Marilou is requesting a loan for 8,000 PHP, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilou faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from Gods.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Moreover, they were also able to landscape the yard, making a summer pavilion. They purchased a vehicle for the business, and her husband purchased valuable and expensive power tools for his work: A drill and a cement mixer. \r\n\r\nThis time, Irina hopes to invest the amount received from Kiva, in the amount of 24,000 hryvnia, in building three new greenhouses at her plot of land, making them heated.

She dreams of seeing them become successful professionals.  Her husband has sponsored her undertaking because his savings provided her first seed capital.  This way Margarita was able to give free reign to her entrepreneurial and business aptitude, because since her grandparents there's a tradition of being merchants.\r\n\r\nShe started her business selling clothing to her neighbors.  Little by little this grew and she brought together a lot of customers.  Today she sells not only clothing but every type of electrical appliance they request.\r\n\r\nIn her seven years of experience with her business she has managed to save to build her house and has helped her husband support the household.  She makes her sales on credit every day, while she makes her purchases in cash in wholesale warehouses.  She works from 7 in the morning until 7 at night every day.  Her business goal is to open a store where she can offer a variety of products to her distinguished customers and earn the market of potential buyers around her.\r\n\r\nCurrently she's applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it she'll buy clothing, footwear, and electrical appliances for the requests her customers have made.\r\n\r\nThis is the Christmas and New Year season and there's disposable income among the families who buy from her.  Thanks to getting a Kiva loan she'll make the most of this situation by having everything her customers need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1259743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing, shoes, and electrical appliances","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":196185},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":224096},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":229325},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":234675},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":240151},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":245755},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":251489},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":257357},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":263362},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":269507},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":275796},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":312302}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.54,"local_amount":196185,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":196562.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519825},{"amount":125.12,"local_amount":224096,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":224527.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071663},{"amount":128.04,"local_amount":229325,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":229766.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497875},{"amount":265.11,"local_amount":474826,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":475740.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527688},{"amount":137.21,"local_amount":245755,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":246228.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705594},{"amount":393.68,"local_amount":705090,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":706448.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967884},{"amount":151.35,"local_amount":271075,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":271597.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323362},{"amount":364.95,"local_amount":653648,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":654907.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082612}],"funded_date":"2012-12-31T19:30:10Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":509323,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is requesting a loan from TRM, which she will use to buy second-hand t-shirts, skirts, jeans, and bags.

","en":"Bermet is 57 years old, married, and she raised four children.  With the collapse of the USSR, difficult times began for everyone, and each chose his own way to provide food for his family.  Having received her own plot from the collective farm in 1990, Bermet began a business in animal husbandry and farming with 3,000 som (KGS).  Today, Bermet has three milk cows, six sheep, and 3.42 hectares of irrigated land where she grows wheat, sainfoin, and potatoes.  Nowadays, Bermet's main priority is to provide her children with a firm foundation.\r\n\r\nWith plans to further develop her business, Bermet applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep and bulls, which she will fatten and later sell.  Bermet plans to invest the profits in further growing her business and in building a home on her own

She is married to Ronnie, a vendor, and is a mother. She and her husband share the responsibility in attending to their young children, and at the same time, earning an income for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nGertrudes is a Balut vendor. In the Philippines, Balut is well-known egg that is sold on the sidewalk. Balut is an duck egg that has not been hatched; instead it is cooked as a boiled egg with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is a highly nutritious food that Filipinos love, especially when they feel tired as it revitalizes their energy and strength. About 450-600 Balut eggs are being boiled and sold every night. She and her husband do the boiling to lessen expenses for the vendors that will sell it. They earn 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales per day.  \r\n\r\nGertrudes is requesting a loan of PHP 22,000 that she will use to buy additional Balut eggs. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nGertrudes dreams of giving her children a good, quality education. For now, she and her husband will just continue to lean on each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future. She never fails to attend weekly fellowship*, as it inspires her to go on with their life no matter what are the obstacles because she has a big God Who will never fail her. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

However, the money was not enough to do all he wanted to do. Because he wanted a payment that would fit into his budget, he has waited until now to request another loan of 1,000,000 UGX to renovate the remaining part of his houses.

Only one of the children, Lisbet, who is 5, lives with them and they raise and educate her in their own home which is situated in a village in the central rainforest.  Norma is a remarkable woman.  A year and a half ago she lost a large quantity of goods due to flooding, but managed to scrape together enough money not only to rebuild her home but also to reopen her drinks, foodstuffs and ready-meals business.  \"Selling fizzy drinks and beer is profitable, since the heat in this region is suffocating, particularly at weekends\", she comments.  But that is not the only service which Norma provides; she also sells pre-ordered meals, particularly breakfasts and lunches, to local teachers and workers.  Her efforts have enabled her to provide a decent education for her children.  Her ambitions are to increase her sales, which will mean investing in the purchase of merchandise to stock her stall.

The refrigerator repair workshop has been running for the last seven years. People from the town and the periphery depend on her workshop. Her son also keeps orders for fitting air conditioners in the vehicles. He covers a distance of 100 kms radius for this work. She has engaged three skilled workers in her workshop @ 3,000 INR each per month.  Her monthly net income from these businesses is around 10,000 INR.

Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

It will be hard work for Marika, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and will increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in her clothing trading business to increase her stock and sales volume.

is from the Vani district. He is 31 years old, single and lives with his mother who has chronic health problems and is provided with a relevant pension from the local government. Levan\u2019s source of income is a small amount of rent from his store.  As the existing income is not enough for the family, Levan decided to start a new business. In particular, he plans to finish the renovation of an additional store and rent it for a good price. Levan has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. However, his loan request was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, for they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this loan, Levan will install doors and windows in his newly built store and renovate it properly so that it satisfies the personal needs of his clients. Levan hopes his business will be profitable and this will increase his income, providing his family with enough money to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living

Paola's business is the sale of lubricants, for which she set up a rented locale in partnership with a friend, where the partner serves customers the majority of the time, since Paola counts on a job as a policewoman for work, and has rotating shifts.\r\n\r\nShe started this business in partnership more than 8 months ago, because of the idea and plan of her friend, sharing the profits fairly. She considers the business profitable enough because of the profits that it leaves her, since she succeeds in selling many lubricants because of the demand and the growth of the parking lot.\r\n\r\nShe likes the business because of the additional income that it generates. She is looking forward to increasing the customer service personnel, because the customers are increasing each day. She doesn't like the disorder that is caused by the minute when her locale fills up. But the financial income allows her to increase her income. On the other hand she has plans to continue and grow the business. Therefore this will be loan number 2 with the microfinance institution.

She was one of the first Yellow Leaf weavers and will be a member of our inaugural Kiva microloan class.\n\nThrough a zero-interest Kiva loan and the Yellow Leaf distribution network, her family will have guaranteed weaving income and financial stability for the first time in 2013. This is a tremendous step for a woman born in Yalana\u2019s circumstances.  \n\nYalana was born in the jungles of rural northern Thailand at the end of an era for her tribe, the Mlabri. When she was a young lady life rapidly changed as deforestation destroyed much of the jungles in which the Mlabri had lived for generations.  Without any land rights or capital to farm, she, along with the rest of the tribe, eventually became indentured servants working in the fields of the more aggressive tribes in the area.\n\nHer father was a respected sorcerer and very knowledgeable about traditional Mlabri life.  As encroaching logging and agriculture overwhelmed traditional ways of life, she found herself with few alternatives to servitude. \n\nHammock weaving presented an excellent opportunity!  Today she lives in the Ban Bunyuen village and helps provide for her family by applying her traditional artisan talents toward weaving hammocks that are sold around the world.  \n\nShe has acquired enough independence to be able to plant rice fields for her family, generally harvesting enough grain to last from one harvest to the next.  Hunting and foraging continue to play a role in her family\u2019s daily sustenance, but they are no longer limited to what they can hunt, trap, catch or kill; her income from making hammocks affords them healthcare, education, and food security formerly unavailable to them.\n\nWith her past way of life no longer viable, she has adjusted to her new situation while maintaining her pride and confidence in being a Mlabri person.\n\nWith this loan, not only will she will be able to make more money, but she can create a stockpile of hammocks during the off season to ensure a steady flow of income throughout the year.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1259084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for yarn and ensure a steady flow of income throughout the year.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\"yalana\" Duangpon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"THB","disbursal_amount":15417,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15417}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":15417,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-01T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":16058.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381854110}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T22:00:40Z","paid_date":"2013-08-01T09:27:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":509230,"name":"Yadi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yadi is an artisan weaver living in rural northern Thailand.

Rapid deforestation, reckless development and warfare in the mid-20th century robbed them of their jungle home and nearly destroyed the tribe's unique lifestyle- they were forced to labor in toxic slash & burn agriculture as indentured servants. Malaria and malnourishment decimated the tribe- they are listed on UNESCO's endangered languages list with just 300 Mlabri left in the world.\n\nYadi was born in the jungles to a traditional Mlabri family as the world around them fell apart. She spent all of her growing up years working as a laborer in the fields, feeling that she had no options to take control of her future. When the opportunity to weave hammocks came along, she leapt at it! She was among the first group to learn and perfect hammock weaving and she has never gone back to being a hired hand again. \n\nYadi would like to improve her home-based weaving operation, where she can watch over her younger children, and invest in raw materials so she can secure consistent weaving work and increase her income potential. \n\nYadi is married with six children and she has helped ensure each of them receives the formal education she was denied.

Her work starts after she arises very early to open her food store at approximately 6 a.m. to begin her daily sales to the people in her neighborhood, who leave very early for their own jobs. She is a very happy and persuasive salesperson and this has enabled her to attract more customers than the competition. At first she had difficulty because she did not know much about running a business. However over time, she began gaining experience and now she is an excellent salesperson. \r\n\r\nWhat she most enjoys about her work is talking with her customers because that is how she learns about the happenings in the neighborhood.

She is also kind and cordial. Her partner is Eber, who is employed. She lives in the company of only her partner, comfortably set up in their own home, which they built with much effort. Diva is a dressmaker, a trade that she learned studying in a center for occupational education. She then bought a sewing machine with her savings, which she installed in her own home, where she serves her customers who seek her out for her good finishing touches. She succeeds in gaining their acceptance and thus they recommend her to other people who then become her regular customers. She started in this business more than 1 year ago, and until this moment she does it alone. She considers her business profitable because of the profits that it brings her.\r\n\r\nShe likes the trade of dressmaking because of the occupation that it offers her, which is useful to her to support her partner in settling the expenses of their home. But she comments that she feels a little uncomfortable from the physical tiredness from being seated in the same posture which causes her shoulder pain, but this does not discourage her and she continues working and making efforts. Therefore she has plans to expand her business and buy herself other sewing machines to be able to assemble a little workshop in her house. Therefore this will be her loan number 2 with the microfinance institution. That's why she is counting on its collaboration in order to be able to make her plans concrete. Therefore she commits to fulfill her payment of her installments to have a good credit history which allows her access to future loans.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 800 PEN she will invest in repairing her machine which serves to do her dressmaking and with the balance she has planned to buy sewing materials such as fabric, thread and so on, seeking low prices for her volume purchases."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1258870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-19T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-18T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":121.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":121.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":132.22},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":137.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":142.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":146.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.16,"local_amount":121.02,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":126.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573048},{"amount":49.26,"local_amount":121.24,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122690},{"amount":53.71,"local_amount":132.22,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":137.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868516},{"amount":55.72,"local_amount":137.15,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":142.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577347},{"amount":67.93,"local_amount":167.22,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":174.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529588},{"amount":49.22,"local_amount":121.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":126.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974640}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T22:38:28Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"S Mason","image":null}},{"id":509806,"name":"Maria Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Isabel de 52 anos de edad, casada con un hijo de 18 anos el cual esta estudiando, ella es originaria del Malpaisillo, lugar  que esta ubicado en la zona norte del pa\u00eds.

They already know that they are going to find the things they need.

She lives in the company of her husband Arbildo, who is retired, and her three children of the ages 35, 36, and 39.  They are comfortable in their own home.  The business that Zoila has is the sale of food, like prepared meals, from Monday to Friday while very kindly attending to her customers.  She manages to have good reception and demand.  She also sells grilled chicken on Sundays.  She has been doing this business for 15 years, relying on the help of her daughter. She began it herself with the capital from a private loan.\r\n\r\nShe says she like her job because she enjoys cooking (having learned from her mother the secrets to a good seasoning) as well as for the financial income that allows her to pay her bills and cover the household expenses.  On the contrary, she does not like it due to the physical fatigue from having to get up very early in the morning to make preparations for the day.  But this does not discourage her and she carries on with her work, which is why she wishes to grow her business and improve her roof so she can more comfortably tend to her customers.  Thus, this will be her 16th loan with the MFP institution, and with it she hopes to be able to settle her plans.  Furthermore, she says she is comfortable with her communal bank since she considers the members to be responsible people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 3000 soles, she will invest in fixing up her floor by pouring cement and in roofing her shop in order to more comfortably take care of her customers.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Don Santos era empleado de una empresa de venta de helados y luego el decidi\u00f3 comenzar con su propio negocio, inicio vendiendo solamente con un fr\u00edzer peque\u00f1o y una bicicleta, en la actualidad don Santos cuenta con un fr\u00edzer mas grande y tres bicicletas para distribuir helados para lograr una mayor zona de venta, tiene dos empleados y su horario de trabajo es de 7:00 am y culmina a las 6:00 pm. El pr\u00e9stamo que solicita don Santos lo necesita para invertirlo en la compra de producto para producir el helado y una bicicleta para que le ayude a cubrir todo su mercado. Con este pr\u00e9stamo cambiaria la vida de don Santos ya que no contaba con el dinero suficiente para comprar la mercader\u00eda necesaria para poder satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes. El \u00fanico problema que enfrenta es en la temporada de lluvia ya que las ventas bajan. Una de sus metas es establecer una distribuidora de helados m\u00e1s amplio y con mucha mayor productividad. Es su primer cr\u00e9dito en FAMA y espera cancelar sus cuotas de forma puntual. ","en":"Santos, 30, is married and has two children.  His wife does household chores and also helps him with the business.  Santos used to be employed by an ice-cream selling firm and he then decided to start his own business.  He started out selling with just a small freezer and a bicycle.  Currently, Santos has a bigger freezer and three bicycles to distribute ice-cream and covers a larger sales area.  He has two employees and his work day starts at 7am and ends at 6pm.  \r\n\r\nThe loan Santos is asking for is needed to buy ingredients to make ice-cream and to buy a bicycle to help him cover his entire market.  This loan will change Santos\u2019 life because he\u2019s not had enough money to buy the necessary merchandise to meet customer demand.  The only problem he faces is the rainy season when sales drop.   One of his goals is to open a larger ice-cream distributing center with much more productivity.  This is his first FAMA loan and he intends to make his payments punctually.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1260229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

","en":"Jaime, 43, is a street vendor who makes a living selling natural fruits such as strawberries, kiwi, apples, and grapes.  He started this business after having a store where he sold meals and provisions in small quantities, but it didn't live up to his expectations of profitability.\r\n\r\nLittle by little he saved and rented a little cart.  He bought fruit and began to sell it throughout the streets near his neighborhood.  He also added the famous tutti frutti, a fruit salad prepared with soda and chopped fruit sweetened with honey and served on ice, becoming a delicious drink that pacifies the immense heat of the warm Caribbean sun and climate.\r\n\r\nThese days he goes out with his own fruit cart and visits all the streets of the neighborhood and other places near his home.  He has a  customer base of 150 buyers.\r\n\r\nCurrently he's applying for a Kiva loan, his second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to continue growing in his business.  With the previous loan he increased his working capital.  With the Kiva loan he's applying for now, he hopes to respond to the Christmas and New Year season with seasonal fruits such as grapes, which are part of the toast of every family.\r\n\r\nThe tradition is for all the members of the family to eat 12 grapes at the end of the night on December 31 and request for themselves 12 desires for prosperity.  This is precisely what makes his Kiva loan effective.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1259832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Sabreen is a housewife and her husband is a taxi driver.\r\n\r\nFor the past four years, Sabreen's husband has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and the only source of income for the family, but from time to time, he needs more support to cover necessary costs.\r\n\r\nSabreen is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing a new engine for the taxi he drives and make some repairs to it such as installing new mirrors and lights. This will increase the taxi capacity to work extra hours and enable Sabreen's husband to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has seven children. She describes herself to be a social woman. She operates a grocery store where she sells vegetables and fruits. She has been involved in this business for 15 years. Her business is located in an urban area and her primary customers are local residents. She describes her biggest business challenge to be insufficient funds for improving the business.

He lives in a home of his own with his wife, 45 year old Nancy, and his lovely 18 year old daughter, to whom he wants to provide a brighter future.  Besides his daughter, he also has two adult sons already on their own, whom he taught like a good father, and he worked to provide the best for them.  Eliu\u2019s work consists of making sure that the streets of the city of Pucallpa are safer.  Being a watchman has made him well liked by his neighbors, because they know the dangers to which he is exposed at night, and the courage he has for facing them.  Although things are going well for him in this job, his salary is not enough to provide his family with a dignified life, so a few months ago he started a grocery store, which his wife manages and with which he was able to increase his income in part.  Since he began his business, he has had many difficulties, such as not knowing how to manage it, but over time he gained experience and has been improving each day.  \r\n\r\nHe is happy in his job, since it\u2019s very satisfying to know that thanks to his job, people can sleep soundly.  He has been doing this for four years and he considers the most difficult thing is having to stay up all night, given the things that happen in the city.

woman has been developing her business of sewing women's clothing for over five years.  Her name is Kholida.  She is 30 years old, married, and has three children.  Her husband earns a small salary and he isn't in a position to fully provide for the family.  Kholida must meet her own expenses, as well as provide clothing and schooling for the children.  \r\n\r\nIn order to develop her business and earn a larger income, Kholida works very hard.  Because of her good service, she has a large client base.  However, many of her competitors have embroidery machines and many people prefer seamstresses who are able to embroider.  If Kholida doesn't also buy an embroidery machine and offer this service, she will lose all her clients.  She needs an embroidery machine, but her income isn't enough for her to buy one.  She is requesting a loan of 3,500 somoni (TJS) to buy an embroidery machine.  She is relying on you and your

The climate of Asror's home is very favourable to cultivating crops and animal husbandry, and so he has been raising cattle and growing grapes for over 17 years. Asror sells the cattle after taking care of it for several months, and has many customers at the local market. His wife helps him with the business.\r\n\r\nAsror would like to develop his business but lacks the funds to do so.

He is married to a wonderful woman, Zuhro, who helps him with his business. Huseyn has 4 children, two of whom are of the age of majority, while two are younger. Together with his family, Huseyn lives in an agricultural area, and so it was natural for him, 20 years ago, to launch his business of cultivating grains and grapes. He mainly grows wheat, as it is in high demand at the local market. Huseyn's two oldest sons help their father with the business.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue to provide his family with all necessities of life, Huseyn wants to develop his business, and for that he needs to increase his harvest. He is planning to do a winter sowing of wheat, but lacks the funds to purchase seeds or mineral fertilizers after spending all his money on his family's needs. Huseyn is requesting a loan of 2000 somoni in order to buy mineral fertilizers and seeds. He promises to repay the loan on time. He will use his business profits to give good education to his children and improve the quality of their life. Huseyn needs and is counting on your

As a source of income for her family, Guliza started a business raising livestock 33 years ago.  Starting with 6,000 KGS, today the farm brings in about 8,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and meat.  There are now two dairy cows, two bulls and ten sheep on the farm.  To help increase her head of livestock, Guliza turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy two dairy cows.  This will allow her to increase her income as well as her head of livestock, and to build a big barn next year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1259570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase two dairy cows ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-20T10:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-19T10:30:01Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3504},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3595},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3687},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3783},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3880},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3981},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4189},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4297},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.46,"local_amount":3504,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071307},{"amount":76.39,"local_amount":3595,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3616.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459739},{"amount":78.35,"local_amount":3687,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3709.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012506},{"amount":80.39,"local_amount":3783,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3806.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754860},{"amount":82.45,"local_amount":3880,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3903.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458877},{"amount":84.6,"local_amount":3981,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4005.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863012},{"amount":86.78,"local_amount":4084,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4108.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631543},{"amount":89.02,"local_amount":4189,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4214.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495427},{"amount":91.31,"local_amount":4297,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4323.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743665},{"amount":901,"local_amount":42400,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":42658.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013884},{"amount":55.25,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426733}],"funded_date":"2012-12-24T19:02:02Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":508412,"name":"Youns Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Youns which consists of three women and one man who live in Taiz, Yemen.

Over the course of preparing her loan, Shaikul showed herself to be responsible, conscientious, and enterprising, with a sense of duty, as well as knowing how to properly manage her financial resources and invest them in the right things.  Since 1996, Shaikul has been in the business of animal husbandry and farming, which are the primary source of income for the family.  She began her business with 2,000 KGS, and thanks to her hard work, her business now brings her about 8,000 KGS per month, which serves as the basis for covering her family's food and other household needs.  \r\n\r\nShaikul also has 1.80 hectares, where she cultivates wheat and perennial grasses.  Over the years, her business has become very well developed.  She now has two horses and 15 sheep.  The income from her business has allowed Shaikul to give her children an education.

","en":"Turumkan is 64 years old and the mother of two children.  Turumkan's children are adults and they work in Moscow.  Turumkan has a secondary-level education and until 1996, she worked on a collective farm.  She is a very calm and hardworking person.  In search of a source of income for her family, in 1996 Turumkan started her own business in animal husbandry and farming with a starting capital of 2,000 som (KGS).  As a result of her persistence and hard work, Turumkan developed her business to where it now has a monthly income of 6,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products.\r\n\r\nTo increase her family's income, Turumkan must increase the size of her herd.  She applied to Bai tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy four cows.  Going forward, with the additional cows, Turumkan will increase her milk

For the past four years, Sarah has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase her stock of essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil and sugar, as well as a fridge to attract more customers. This will help Sarah to generate greater profits and improve her family standards of living and pay for her medical bills. Sarah hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Sarah who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

He is a very energetic and motivated person.  His wife is a good and proper woman.  She works for a small salary that isn't enough to provide for the family, so Asliddin is the family's main breadwinner.  For a number of years he has earned his living growing crops, like wheat, and various grains, which he sells at the market.  He manages his own business.  He would like to expand the business in order to provide his family with all its needs, so he has to harvest a higher yield.  He is seeking a loan for 2000 soms to buy mineral fertilizers.  He's got big plans for the future if he gets a good harvest; once he makes the income he'll buy essential equipment that his family has needed for many years.  Asliddin is a respectable man and promises to pay off the loan on time.
