Thanks to her parents, she graduated and for more than ten years has been working at a school in her region as a primary school teacher. She loves her profession and does her work with pleasure, but she gets a small salary which is not enough to support a family. \r\n\r\nIn order to learn sewing and cutting, over the summer she took a course and learned how to sew women's national dresses. She plans to organize her own business sewing women's clothing, because there is great demand. In her region, there are few dressmakers and all the women go to dressmakers in the city to sew their dresses. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 1,000 Somoni to buy a sewing machine. She is awaiting and hoping for your kindness. This loan will help her to organize the business and thus improve her living conditions.

He is married and has four children who are all currently in school. For the past five years, Stephen has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells sugar, salt, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Stephen has requested a loan of 2,000,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock up on essential commodities such as milk, cooking oil, sugar, and salt in order to attract more customers. Profits will increase and will help Stephen to pay school fees for his four children. Stephen hopes that in the future he will be able to expand his business into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nStephen is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Stephen who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1259762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

old. He is married and is raising one daughter. His daughter is two years old. Bahodurkhon is trying to have his daughter grow up in abundance, so that she wil have memories of her childhood as a \"happy childhood.\" \r\n\r\nA few years ago, he was a migrant laborer in the Russian Federation. When he returned home, he began his own business buying and selling dried fruit. He has been in business already for a year and a half. He is a very hardworking and goal-oriented person, and therefore he managed in 1.5 years to develop his business and receive an income.

","en":"Hasan has a huge heart and a good soul. He is a \"person with a capital P\" and therefore has the respect of many people. He is 45 years old. He is married and has three children. Hasan is trying to keep his family living with abundance, and with this goal he began his own business 19 years ago manufacturing and selling windows and doors. \r\n\r\nHe is a master woordworker with \"golden hands\" and manufactures high quality and beautiful windows and doors in a modern design style. Thanks to excellent service, he has a wide range of customers. Hasan copes the business on his own, as none of the family members helps him in the business. His products are sold mainly in the north of Tajikistan, and the quality of the work never disappoints. \r\n\r\nSince the last time, there is more demand for his products. He wants to develop the business, that is to manufacture more windows and doors. He is requesting a loan of 5,000 Somoni to buy wood. \r\n\r\nHe is a repeat customer and has a good credit history. He promises to repay his loan on time. This loan will help him to get more income and to improve living conditions and thus bring peace and joy to his family.

Guatemala. The six women of this trust bank are involved in various businesses such as the sale of clothes, perfumes and poultry. Another member operates a bakery. As is the custom in several countries around the world, including Guatemala, many micro entrepreneurs take advantage of the holiday season at the end of the year to earn more for their business. Such is the case of Rebecca, a 38-year-old married woman who is a tailor.\r\n\r\nShe is the mother of three children, who currently attend kindergarten and 5th grade. Both Rebecca and her husband are business partners, and they work together. Neither of them completed primary school. They work hard to support their children\u2019s education so that they can excel and perhaps attend college one day. \r\n\r\nAs the year-end holidays have arrived as well as the anticipated beginning of the new school year, Rebecca is quite busy. As there will be an increased demand for school uniforms, Rebecca has applied for a loan with Friendship Bridge so she can buy various kinds of fabrics and other materials necessary to sew clothing.\r\n\r\nThis is Rebecca's 4th loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. She states that she really likes the organization because it not only supports her financially with capital but also because of the monthly training she receives on various subjects such as, women's health, children's rights, business management, among others. She believes that all these topics enrich women\u2019s lives and help them to understand how to live a better life.\r\n\r\nRebecca appreciates the support that her business is receiving through the KIVA investors. She wishes a Merry Christmas to all and a very happy and\r\nblessed 2013.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":1254345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabrics.

He is married, and has four children, aged 20, 17, 13 and 10. He has one additional dependent, who lives with him because of schooling.  In 1993, Mohamed established his tailoring business. He began his business just to enable him to settle his domestic problem. His business is located at the center of town and his main customers are both men and women. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 350,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. Mohamed has already received and successfully repaid two loans and now requires a new loan in order to buy tailoring supplies. He hopes that this loan will help increase his output. In the future, Mohamed plans to establish a modern tailoring shop and to develop his plot of land. He thanks you for your

Desde que comenz\u00f3 en \u00e9ste negocio le ha ido muy bien gracias a su carisma y a la calidad de cada uno de los art\u00edculos que vende.\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es vender y es muy feliz cuando toda su mercader\u00eda se agota, lleva 9 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar los zapatos, ya que las cajas que trae son muy pesadas y se agita mucho por el esfuerzo que hace, sin embargo sigue adelante y en un futuro cercano espera tener una tienda en la que pueda vender todo tipo de prendas y calzados y continuar trabajando en lo que considera que es su pasi\u00f3n. Este es el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 11 con MFP, por tanto agradece a quienes hacen posible su cr\u00e9dito para continuar con sus objetivos, por otro lado est\u00e1 muy comprometida una vez m\u00e1s a cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas como lo hizo en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo, est\u00e1 muy contenta de pertenecer a su banco comunal ya que todos sus integrantes son muy buenos, amables y solidarios.\nCon el monto solicitado (S\/. 2000), desea incrementar la variedad de sus productos comprando mayor cantidad de zapatos, sandalias y adem\u00e1s diversas prendas de vestir para venderlos en la temporada navide\u00f1a. \n\n","en":"Mar\u00eda is 27 years old and is a very young, friendly and hard working woman. She is the mother of a 7 year old boy and lives with 28 year old Julio, who is the father of her son. With her family, she lives in the house that they built with the economic support of relatives. Here the couple shares the happiness of living together and working continuously to have a better quality of life. Mar\u00eda makes a living selling shoes and sandals, every two weeks or once a month, depending on the demand. To get her merchandise she travels to another city on bus for more than 20 hours. From there she makes the same trip back with the large amount of items to sell among relatives, friends and others. \r\n\r\nThe styles that she brings back are in style, exclusive and high quality. For this reason, she is able to sell them all in little time. She makes her sales on foot, traveling through the main streets of the city in search of customers that would like to buy something that she has with her. Sometimes customers make orders in advance. Since she began the business it has gone very well for her thanks to her charisma and the quality of all the items that she sells. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is making sales and is very happy when she runs out of her merchandise. She has been doing this work for nine years and says that the most difficult part is transporting the shoes because the boxes are very heavy and the strain needed to do it agitates her. However, she continues moving forward and in the near future she hopes to have a store where she can sell all types of apparel and footwear and continue working in what she considers is her passion. \r\n\r\nThis is her eleventh loan with MFP and is thankful to those who make her previous loan possible so that she can continue with her objectives. She is once again very committed to making her payments on time like she has done with the previous loans that she has had. She is very happy to belong to a communal bank because all the members are good people, friendly and supportive. \r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (2000 soles) she hopes to increase the variety of her products by buying greater quantities of shoes, sandals and different types of clothing to sell during the Christmas season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1261153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes, sandals and varied apparel.

She works in all these activities with full responsibility and under a determined schedule. \r\n\r\nFor the business' future she hopes to have a well stocked bar where she would be able to sell all day more peacefully. She currently only sells her drinks during the afternoons. Although she already has experience in this work she feels that she still has difficulty attending to all her customers. However, she hopes that all the effort she puts in, it will produce good results. Until now, the only thing that she hopes for is to continue moving forward. \r\n\r\nThis is her eleventh loan with MFP and is very happy to know that she has financial support since it makes her feel more certain that she will advance with her work. She is committed once again to make her payments on time like she has done with the previous loans that she has had. She is very happy to belong to a communal bank because all of the members are very responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (3000 soles) she will buy more drinks to have for her business and thus be able to satisfy all of her customers' orders and have different types and brands of drinks.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Because the dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those listed in the catalogue, the dealer is able to make a profit on the items. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 24,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMyra dreams to expand her business and hopes that her family will have good health. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

After her training, she opened a small sewing shop which has been operating for 2 years. She also does embroidery, but she doesn\u2019t have all the material she needs to keep up with her orders and be able to satisfy her clientele in time. This is why she is seeking a loan to buy fabric and small sewing supplies (pins, needles, lining, thread,\u2026) which will prevent her from needing to go to the market all the time and instead be able to sew and sell to her customers. The profits that come from this loan will allow her not only to buy her little sewing supplies to grow her business, but also to satisfy some of her needs as well as those of her small

this picture was taken). Very few of the households in this region have energy access and they rely on ocote wood to light their households. Ocote sends out a lot of smoke and gives out very little light. This does not allow the family of Juan (he has three children) to have an adequate environment for any activities in their household. Ocote is also a health, security and environmental hazard. Juan works in the field, mainly with corn and consumes more than 8 pieces of ocote each week for lighting, his community and other households get these by cutting down trees in nearby forests. This mean of lighting is not only hazardous for Juan and his family, it is also dangerous because their households can burn down and it is also beginning to affect the environment due to the high deforestation that this activity is provoking in the surrounding areas. Deforestation also causes population and their homes to be more exposed to natural disasters. Cerro Ni\u00f1o is a community located in hill slopes so without trees, landslides are more common. This is something that happened during Hurricane Carlota for example. People are left with out communication for weeks when this happens.

When there is a several days blackout, all of Rodolfo\u00b4s and Felix children have to study in their homes by the lights of candles.

They believe a solar system will have great value through saving on their electricity costs and will eliminate the need for the use of candles in their homes when there are blackouts. Both women contribute to their families income by producing clay products that they sell in nearby tourist spots and in nearby commerce centers. They belong to a cooperative of women that is called \u201cMujeres Trabajadoras de Tiltepec\u201d (Working Woman from Tiltepec) and they participate in different exhibitions and are starting to sell their products to different foundations and bigger crafts shops.

In el Para\u00edso, they just got access to the electric grid early 2012, however the service is extremely unreliable. They continue to rely on candles when the lights go out. They mention blackouts can last up to 8 days during the rainy season due to their geographical conditions. They believe a solar system will have great value, providing savings in their electricity costs and will eliminate the need for the use of candles in their homes when there are blackouts. Both women contribute to their families income and belong to a cooperative of women that is called \u201cMujeres Trabajadoras de Tiltepec\u201d (Working Woman from Tiltepec). This cooperative participates in different exhibitions and is helping women to sell their products to different foundations and bigger crafts shops. Catalina is teaching her daughter-in-law Lidia to work with clay, and Macario is in charge of selling the products because Catalina only speaks Chatino and can't communicate with clients in Spanish. A loan for a solar home system will allow these working women to have 4 additional hours of quality lighting to work and generate higher incomes for their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1257939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"Macario, Catalina and Lidia each purchase a solar home system to have reliable energy access in their homes and gain 4 hours more to produce clay products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Mar\u00eda Tiltepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":275,"posted_date":"2012-12-20T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-19T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Macario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":570}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.37,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":605.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347096727},{"amount":47.37,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":605.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355841888},{"amount":142.11,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-14T09:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1817.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381728501},{"amount":47.37,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":605.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390980397},{"amount":31.58,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":403.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399835810},{"amount":47.37,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":605.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410334520},{"amount":55.26,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":706.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430245973},{"amount":31.57,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-04T09:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":403.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459122527}],"funded_date":"2012-12-20T22:07:58Z","paid_date":"2014-06-04T09:17:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":510281,"name":"Casimir","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"casimir est un homme de 44 ans mari\u00e9 p\u00e8re d'un enfant de 12 ans.

She is separated from her common-law husband of many years.  Currently she lives in her own house that she built next to her ex-partner.  Three of their four children live with her, and day after day they fight together to create a better life for themselves.\r\n\r\nShe is a woman who has always worked to get ahead.  She is involved in various activities to generate income, such as washing clothes, selling used clothes and selling soft drinks on the weekends.  However, her most important activity is focused on food sales.  She rents a space within a government building and offers various dishes that are well-received by her customers.\r\n\r\nShe makes the most delicious Peruvian dishes, such as \u201carroz con pollo\u201d (chicken with rice),  \u201cpapa a la huanca\u00edna\" (potatoes with a special sauce) \u201clomo saltado\u201d (salted beef loin),  \u201caj\u00ed de gallina\u201d (hen with chili peppers) and others.  These are always served with delicious drinks such as  \u201cchicha morada\u201d (a rice and fruit-based drink)  or \u201caguajina\u201d, which is made from palm tree fruit.  She has been doing this work for five years and has help from her children.\r\n\r\nWhat Roc\u00edo likes most about her work is that she is able to set her own schedule so that she can manage her time and dedicate it to various activities.  Her business is progressing because she likes what she does, and she hopes that in time she will be able to have a modest restaurant in which she can provide greater comfort to her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is thankful for the opportunity and faith that the institution has put in her.  She promises to comply with her loan repayment schedule.  She is also glad to be part of her communal bank, since the members are responsible and supportive.  The funds she is seeking (1800 <em>nuevos soles<\/em>) will be invested in various ingredients that she needs in order to make the food that she sells.  This will include rice, potatoes, meats, condiments, oil and other

She does all types of medical exams and tests, always with a lot of responsibility, respect, and confidentiality toward the patient.  She has been doing this work for a year, and up until now it's been going very well.  In her spare time, Cindy sells clothing on credit, based on specific orders.  What she enjoys about her work is that it allows her to have time to devote to her family when she needs it.\r\n\r\nCindy hopes to continue to work as she has done until now, and gradually set up her own medical clinic, acquiring new laboratory equipment  so that she could start to do a variety of types of tests.

Also, she is certain that she will continue to be a member who is punctual and responsible with her payments, as she was with her previous loans.

He is single and lives in his own home with his two children, who are 20 and 19 years old.  His mother also lives with them.  Getulio loves each member of his family very much and he works hard everyday to improve their quality of life.  Getulio's business is street sales of sweets and fried bananas, known as \"chifles.\"  He also rents his \"mototaxi\" (a motor bike taxi used for transportation services), which generates some additional income.  He principally makes the sweets and fried bananas in his house, with the help of his children.  To make them, he stocks up on raw materials, such as \"bellaco,\" or green, bananas.  He cuts them up one at a time and then fries them.  Finally, he bags them up and heads out the to city streets to sell them.  Each bag of \"chilfes\" is sold with onion sauce.  Getulio decided to start this business more than two years ago.  During that time, his business has grown, and he has made a name for himself with the high quality and delicious taste of his products.  Getulio feels that his business is profitable because it's easy to carry out and because he earns a good living.  In addition, he likes to relate to people and to strike up friendships with his regular customers.  Getulio earns a profit every day, which he invests again to earn more money.  He hopes to grow his business and produce a greater volume so he can sell wholesale to the small groceries in the settlements.  This is Getulio's third loan with MFP.  As such, he is grateful to all the people who make his financing possible and allow him to continue working toward his goals and planned growth.  In addition, he is certain that he will once again punctually repay his loan, just like he has with his previous loans.  Getulio is very thankful to be a client of MFP, as they offer him all the help he needs to keep moving forward. \r\nWith the requested sum of 2000 nuevos soles (USD $800), Getulio will invest in the purchase of supplies, like banana bunches, cooking oil, bags, onions, lemons and other ingredients for making \"chifles.\"  He will also purchase a load of firewood to be used in the stove where he fries the bananas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1261317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase banana bunches, cooking oil, bags, onions, lemons and other ingredients.

She is a good, honest and kind woman. She is single and has 3 grown children. All of them live in the home she was able to buy with the help of her ex. Saturnina's main activity is making stews and various food. She has a great gift and is known as one of the best cooks in her area.  That is why her modest restaurant is one of the busiest in the area. Her customers go to her every day to try the delicious meals she prepares with so much hard work and affection. Right now, the locale where she works is rented, but she hopes to have her own establishment soon. She has been doing this activity for 4 years with the help of her daughter and another woman. She complements her activity by selling different brands, prices and sizes of soft drinks. What she likes the most about her job is making her stews, enjoying the aromas and flavors, knowing that her faithful customers enjoy every dish that delights their palates. That is why she does her job with so much love and dedication, though sometimes she feels she can't please everyone as quickly as she would like to. She hopes to continue improving the infrastructure of her restaurant and outfit it with utensils. This is her 7th individual loan with the MFP institution. She is grateful to all of the people who have made her loan possible so she can continue with her goals and growth she has planned. She is also very determined to make her payments on time once again like she did with the previous loans. She really likes being a client of the institution since they offer her all of the necessary support to get ahead.

She is single and lives with her three children aged 4, 8 and 12.  She has her own house, which she was able to build as a result of her hard work.  She shares many days of endless joy with her family, and together they strive to build a better life.\r\n\r\nHer work consists of making clothing for men, women and children.  She has utmost patience as she makes these clothes on order from her customers.  She mostly makes women's lingerie but also makes other items, and often personally designs her own clothing.  She has been doing this for one year.  She has always worked on her own and affirms that she has never had a complaint from her customers.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy because she knows that her work enables her to generate her own income, which allows her to bring her children everything they need.  What she likes about her work is that she can express herself in her own designs that inspire her.  The ease with which she creates something new has distinguished her as one of the best seamstresses in the city, and she always feels that she is making an impact.  (However, she makes it clear that she does not much enjoy making pants for men, due to the difficulty of this activity.)  Soon she hopes to build a much larger sewing shop and dedicate a space solely to her own designs.\r\n\r\nThis is her group's first loan with MFP.  She is grateful to those who are making this loan possible; she needs the loan in order to keep growing her business.

The need to be independent and the daily household expenses that she had to cover were the main motivations that led her to develop her business. She has run her stand for almost four years. In the beginning, she felt very intimidated by starting a business, but with time she was able to develop her skills; now she sells a lot and is happy about that.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is chatting with her customers and making them laugh. She thinks the hardest part is having to sell out in the strong morning sun. She would love to have a snack shop where she could sell in greater comfort and offer a better variety of products to her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP, so she thanks those who make her loan possible so that she can continue toward her objectives. She is once again very committed to repaying her loan on time, as she did with the previous loans that she has had. She is very happy to belong to her communal bank because all its members are very good, kind, people who are supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nWith the requested money, she will buy a larger quantity of snacks to offer to her customers. In addition, she will begin to stock her stand with some groceries.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1261171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

58, lives with his wife, son, and grandson.

It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s a farmer\u2019s life,\u201d says Felipe. \n\nBeside cacao, Felipe also receives income from corn sold at the Punta Gorda market, one hour down the road from San Jose, as well as beans and yams sold locally. He has used this money to invest in one of few solar panels in the village of San Jose, Toledo District, which is not connected to the grid due to poor road access. The solar panel is hooked to a battery and an inverter to provide electricity for stable phone use and light. What helped Felipe beat his peers in installing electricity in the home? \u201cI never neglect anything,\u201d he says, and lives by it. \n\nFelipe will use the loan to invest in cleaning his cacao plots. Cleaning means cutting the underbrush to clear access to the trees for pruning and harvesting and is fundamental in preventing spread of mold in the rainy season. Cacao farms located in lowland tropical forest require cleaning every 3-4 months. \n\nAn entrepreneur at heart, Felipe is all about diversifying his crops and is one of few farmers to grow fresh vegetables \u2013 cabbage, tomato and peppers among others on his farm. Why diversify? \u201cCorn is just not tasty without the pepper sauce to go with it,\u201d he told us in perfect English \u2013 his second language after Maya Mopan. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1260104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To hire help to clean 4 acres of cacao farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2012-12-20T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-19T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347117822},{"amount":26.26,"local_amount":47.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":52.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863433},{"amount":20.88,"local_amount":37.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":41.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098921},{"amount":23.86,"local_amount":43.38,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":47.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971136},{"amount":32,"local_amount":58.18,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751661},{"amount":26.77,"local_amount":48.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":53.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993402},{"amount":23.01,"local_amount":41.84,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":45.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255571},{"amount":23.01,"local_amount":41.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":45.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136412},{"amount":26.93,"local_amount":48.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":53.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900629},{"amount":46.16,"local_amount":83.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":92.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088514}],"funded_date":"2012-12-20T23:55:28Z","paid_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":510495,"name":"Catarino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"An experienced farmer, and relatively new to cacao, Catarino planted his first two acres in 2000.

Planting new seedlings is a long-term investment, as cacao trees take 3-5 years to start producing pods. \n\nInvestment in the farm facilitated by loans translates to investment in his children, 5 of whom are currently enrolled in school.

72, lives in the village of San Jose with his wife Isabela and two children. Asked to recount how many children he has, Alfonso counts studiously naming different villages where they all live. \n\nAlfonso has been farming for 30 years, and works one of the bigger cacao farms in the area, spread out in 3 plots encompassing 4 acres and around 1,600 producing trees. One of the most productive families in the Maya Mountain Cacao network, Alfonso\u2019s farm has been under constant expansion. \u201cThe happiest moments are when the trees are producing well and we have you guys here buying every weekend,\u201d Alfonso told MMC, adding that on the few occasions when there\u2019s no production to sell it really feels like he\u2019s losing out, but that\u2019s cacao. There\u2019s money to be made in cacao, and if everything goes perfect and he manages to keep the diseases in check, he says he\u2019ll be a rich man.  \n\nAlfonso is getting ready for cleaning the underbrush surrounding his cacao trees before the upcoming harvest season. Cacao pod production is picking up slowly and will reach full swing in March-April and continue until it slows again In July-August. Cleaning is a routine activity on shade-grown cacao farms in tropical lowlands and needs to be repeated every three to four months.

boasts an exemplary family, household and farm. Eladio and his wife Virginia have brought up 15 children, of which the youngest Jahir will turn 5 in January and oldest, Adalia, is 34. Add to that some 13 grandchildren and spouses of the 10 live-in kids and you can picture this famous family from San Pedro Columbia. \n\nMost westerners have a hard time even imagining anything past a couple of children, but Eladio and Virginia have embraced each without fail and have worked out parenting to an art. Visitors from around the world have been visiting this beautiful family and their farm since they started a sustainable tourism enterprise. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky to meet my brothers and sisters around the world just through a little garden,\u201d Eladio says enthusiastically. Most of the family is trilingual, as Eladio comes from a Mopan Maya speaking environment and Virginia's background is Q'eqchi', and everybody also speaks English on top of the two Maya tongues. \n\nBeside cacao, they grow more exotic crops like mango, coconut, ginger, lemongrass and Jamaican lime. \u201cI grow whatever the birds or the agouti [type of rodent]bring. That\u2019s how an agouti works. I keep stashing the seeds also,\u201d Eladio assures us with a huge smile. The 31-acre farm has been key in sustaining the numerous family and also served as a source of learning for the family and now visitors from abroad. Eladio and Virginia\u2019s farm is a prime example of integrated farming, where timber and fruit trees abound in harmony and soil is enriched by composting underbrush cleared for pathways to access the crop. Integrated farming brings opportunities for soil enrichment, but also means more work cleaning, pruning and raking the underbrush to transform it to compost. Regular cleaning is indispensable for cacao farms on tropical lowlands as good soil, rain and shade make for prime conditions for growth. \u201cEverybody wants to be a student these days. I want my kids to be farmers,\u201d says Eladio.

53, and his wife Margarita live in the village of Indian Creek, close to the highway connecting southern Belize to the ex capital of Belize City.

Having initially tried to manage a teaching job alongside farming, he opted to join the ranks of many farmers making their land their full-time job and are looking sustain their families by tapping into new markets for cash crops. To diversify his income stream, Santiago has kept his eyes and ears open about different market opportunities, this has led him to expand to pumpkin, a high-demand crop on the neighboring Guatemala market. Moreover, there is pre-harvest financing for pumpkin, whereas until now there were virtually no financing mechanisms in place for cacao farmers. Santiago has been investing his income in home improvement and diversifying his food supply, such as his recently installed small-scale tilapia ponds.\n\nCacao farming has proved to be risky business for Santiago, whose crop was devastated by Hurricane Iris in 2001, and again in 2007 by a fire that spread from a neighboring farm. Persistent in his efforts, however, he replanted every time, and even transplanted 500 new seedlings in September of 2012 to expand his cacao farm, which has 30-year-old trees. Cacao trees take three to five years to begin producing pods and continue at full capacity for 60-70 years. Farmers have to routinely clean and prune their cacao trees to ease access for harvesting, prevent spread of mold infestation and increase yields in the coming harvest season.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1260185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She works hard to manage her variety store and continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\n\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store where groceries, toiletries, and beverages are sold in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP of cooking oil, or an egg. Liza buys her supplies at wholesale prices and sells by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\n\nNorberta is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to help continue to operate her business and expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income with her loan.\n\nShe hopes that her children will have a good life and she dreams of expanding her business. She faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Tiene planes de comprar 2 maquinas de coser para empezar con el negocio, la cual instal\u00f3 en su propia casa, desde donde atiende a sus clientes quienes la buscan por sus buenos acabados, logrando ganar  su preferencia, luego ellos la recomiendan con otras personas, quienes se convierten en sus clientes habituales. Actualmente cuenta con 3 maquinas de coser que fue comprando con sus ganancias y prestamos anteriores con MFP.\nLleva realizando \u00e9ste oficio hace m\u00e1s de  4 a\u00f1os, y hasta el momento lo viene realizando ella sola.\nConsidera a su negocio rentable por las buenas ganancias que le deja.\nLe gusta su negocio ya que puede desempe\u00f1arse en el oficio que le gusta, la costura, que le vali\u00f3 para solventar los gastos de su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, quienes son  su mayor motivaci\u00f3n para seguir esforz\u00e1ndose. Pero comenta le incomoda un poco el cansancio f\u00edsico por estar sentada en una misma postura que le ocasiona dolores de espalda, pero eso no la desanima y continua trabajando y esforz\u00e1ndose. Por tanto tiene planes de ampliar su negocio e instalar un peque\u00f1o taller de confecciones de prendas de vestir en su casa. Por tanto \u00e9ste ser\u00e1 el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 6 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP, se siente agradecida con el apoyo financiero que viene recibiendo y desea continuar con \u00e9ste apoyo, por tanto se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas como en cr\u00e9ditos anteriores.\nCon el monto solicitado de 1200 nuevos soles, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra  materiales para la confecci\u00f3n de lencer\u00edas como telas, hilos, y dem\u00e1s, buscar\u00e1 precios m\u00e1s bajos por sus compras en volumen, de esa manera tendr\u00e1 mayores m\u00e1rgenes de ganancias.\n\n","en":"\r\nCarmen, 42, is a cheerful woman who very much wants to improve; she\u2019s also kind and gracious.  She\u2019s separated from the father of her three children but she\u2019s in a new relationship seeking to rebuild her life.  She lives with her current partner and her three children comfortably in her own house that she built with her ex-spouse.  \r\n\r\nCarmen\u2019s activity is sewing, an occupation she learned at an occupational education center.  She plans to buy two sewing machines to start the business she set up at home where she tends to customers who seek her out because of the good quality of her work; this is how she wins them over.  Then they recommend her to other people who become her regular customers.  She currently has three sewing machines that she bought with her profits and with prior MFP loans.  She\u2019s been in this business for more than four years and to date has been doing it along.  She considers her business to be quite profitable because of the good profits it yields.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because she can do what she enjoys, sewing, and it has served to cover her household expenses and to pay for her children\u2019s schooling who are her greatest motivation to continue striving forward.  She comments though that the physical exhaustion does cause her some concern because she must remain seated in the same position and this causes her back pain but she does not become discouraged and continues working and striving.\r\n\r\nShe therefore has plans to expand the business and install a small sewing workshop to make clothing at home.  This will be MFP loan #6 and she feels grateful for the financial support she\u2019s been getting and wants to continue with it so she commits to make her payments like she\u2019s done previously.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1,200 new soles to buy sewing supplies like fabric and thread to make lingerie; she will seek out the lowest prices for volume purchases so her profits will be higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1261380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She buys all her merchandise in local shopping centers and sells them in settlements along river banks making periodic trips to that zone to kindly offer and sell to her customers.  The business has been in operation five years having started it with capital of her own and then growing with MFP loans and with her spouse\u2019s help with the sales.

Thanks to it she generates income to cover her own expenses and her children\u2019s schooling who she loves very much.

Because of this, she\u2019s planning to leave this business and go into a new one but something she can do from the comfort of home like a grocery store.  \r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #9.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDolores operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDolores dreams to give her children a good and quality education as well as hopes to expand her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She is married to Aldrin, a driver and she is mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEster operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm sized ones, to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers make up every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEster hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to expand her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1260528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She offers her products daily in the city market and on occasion goes door-to-door, selling to her neighbors.  She believes that her business does well because she is friendly with her clients and, above all, she is responsible and hardworking.\r\n\r\nPascuala is very grateful for the Kiva loans, since thanks to their help she has been able to buy merchandise for her clients.  In this way, she has been able to continue fighting to achieve her greatest dream: that her children will have a profession and improve their quality of life.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit.

She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married and has three children.  Her husband moved to the Russian Federation because he didn't have steady employment in his motherland.  Since her husband left, Munira has been the primary breadwinner for the family.  Several years ago, she studied in a dressmaking course and she has experience in sewing women's clothing.  Her work habits and experience gave her an opportunity to earn money by teaching a dressmaking course.  She has been doing this for three months already and she wants to open her own sewing shop where she will both serve customers and teach several students.\r\n\r\nMunira needs a sewing machine in order to open her shop, but she doesn't have the financial resources to buy one.  Her husband refused to send her the money, so she is requesting a loan of 1,500 somoni (TJS) to buy a sewing machine.  She anticipates your kindness and she is relying only on you.  This loan will help her to open her own business, giving her a source of income that will bring stability into her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1261595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy sewing a machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-21T08:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-20T08:30:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":104.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":115.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":113.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":121.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":141.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":145.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.68,"local_amount":104.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":108.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740979},{"amount":23.93,"local_amount":110.46,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":114.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056275},{"amount":25.05,"local_amount":115.61,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":119.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801970},{"amount":24.49,"local_amount":113.02,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":116.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510214},{"amount":26.39,"local_amount":121.79,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":125.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915497},{"amount":26.19,"local_amount":120.89,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":124.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693211},{"amount":55.71,"local_amount":257.14,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":265.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549872},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":133.88,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":138.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410958845},{"amount":29.73,"local_amount":137.22,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":141.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075010},{"amount":30.7,"local_amount":141.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":146.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430227712},{"amount":31.12,"local_amount":143.62,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":148.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439988751}],"funded_date":"2012-12-21T10:53:55Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:10:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":510424,"name":"Akossiwa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Akossiwa vit avec son conjoint m\u00e9canicien et leur 04enfants \u00e0 Lom\u00e9.

the modern world. She is married to a good man by the name of Assadullo. They do not yet have children, but dream of having beautiful babies. Salomat and her husband live together with his parents. Assadullo's parents are pensioners, while he earns only a small salary, which is insufficient to provide the family with all necessities of life. Salomat has decided to help her husband for the good of the family, and to this end took the course \"Succeed\" organized by the Association of Business Women and earned her graduation certificate. Now she is quite ready to launch her own business and achieve success.\r\n\r\nSalomat would like to start her business of buying and selling cattle, as she has experience in this line of work. She plans to use her profits to improve her living conditions, as well as accumulate savings for her future children.

","en":"When Abdullobeg was a child and played with his friends, he always wanted to play the role of the teacher.  When he grew up, his childhood dream came true.  He is a teacher of history and law.  He is 55 years old, married, and has five children.  His wife is retired and receives a small pension that isn't enough to pay for even her own needs.  The children are adults and help him provide for their family.  They put their money together and use it to buy food, clothing, and to pay for education.  Abdullobeg works in a high school and he loves his profession, but his salary isn't large enough for him to put any money into savings.\r\n\r\nSoon, one of his daughters is going to get married.  Abdullobeg has to pay the dowry and throw a wedding party, which in the Tajik tradition is called a \"domodtalabon.\"  This is a party that is held at home or in a restaurant with friends and family participating.  The table is lavishly set and there is a singer.  At this interesting ceremony, the bride gets bedecked with traditional adornments.  \r\n\r\nAbdullobeg is requesting a loan of 3,000 somoni (TJS) to hold the wedding party.  He is relying on your kindness.  This loan will help him make his daughter happy.  As the conscientious man he is, he promises to repay the loan in a timely fashion."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1261602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal

","en":"Huseyn is a very hard-working and purposeful person. Since childhood, he has laboured for his family's well-being, as they lived in difficult conditions. While his classmates played outside after school, Huseyn worked as an assistant in a cafe-bakery. When he grew a little older, he learned home repair from a professional and began working as a repairman himself. However, the family's expenses grew, and Huseyn was forced to travel to Russia to find work. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Huseyn is 34 years old, married, and has 3 wonderful children in his care. Huseyn's wife is engaged part-time in selling children's clothing, while he works in a bakery after being unable to find good work abroad. The children are too young to work and currently attend school. Huseyn is a very caring father and spends all his money on his children's well-being.\r\n\r\nHuseyn owns a car, which is an absolute necessity for his family. The car recently began to malfunction, but Huseyn lacks the money for its repairs. Additionally, he needs to carry out small repairs in his home. Therefore, Huseyn is requesting a loan of 3000 somoni to repair his car and his house. He is a return client of IMON International and has a good credit history.

After graduating from the university in 2000, Aizada began working in animal husbandry to give her family a source of income.   She started her business with 6,000 som (KGS) and it now brings in about 4,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy products and cattle.   Today, she has one cow and its calf and five sheep.  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to increasing the number of cattle she has, she applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy calves and young sheep.  Aizada plans to invest the profits from the loan in increasing the size of her herd, which will expand her business.  After all, one day she will have to get her children established in life and she wants to get started now so it will be easier

She started her livestock business 30 years ago with a sum of 1,000 som (KGS). Today, she earns around 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of dairy products and resale of livestock. In order to further increase the size of her herd, Jamalkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves and young sheep. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her herd, and also intends to improve the animal's living conditions in the near

Ainur's husband works as head of a museum. In search of a source of income for her family, Ainur started her business of livestock breeding already in 1991, with a starting sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Successfully working in the areas of livestock breeding and field crop cultivation has given good results. Ainur also grows fodder crops, which she uses to provide fodder for her livestock and gets additional income from selling fodder. Besides fodder, Ainur grows potatoes on her plot of land. Every month, the family gets up to 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Ainur turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cows with calves and young sheep. Ainur plans to use the income from the loan in developing her farm. Ainur told us that in the future she plans to build a house at the neighboring plot and improve the conditions of the livestock, building a new, large

He joined this year in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer delivered reliably at the best prices, so that he can grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nLast year, Erasto harvested three bags of maize on one acre of land. He is excited that he will improve his harvest as a One Acre Fund farmer. He plans to spend the money that he earns from his next harvest on sending his children to school, repairing his home, buying livestock, saving for the future and perhaps investing in another business. During the 2013 long rains season, each group member will receive half an acre of agricultural inputs on credit, meaning that Erasto\u2019s group will receive four acres worth in total.\r\n\r\n(One of the group members, Catherine, dropped out of the program after the Kiva photo was taken. She is still pictured above.)"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1257339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the cultivation of maize and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Butere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2012-12-21T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-20T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erasto","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Millicent","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joanes","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":28800,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":30064.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602389}],"funded_date":"2012-12-21T18:39:41Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:19:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Seiji Humphries","image":null}},{"id":510069,"name":"Hoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hoa is requesting a loan to buy new dishes, good quality food, and rice to stock her food stall.

He will use the profits from his loan to uplift his living standards and pay for his children's schooling. In the future, Joshua aspires to have his own public transport vehicle in the next five years. He is very grateful to Juhudi Kilimo for funding his loan.\r\n\r\n

They had a family together but at the moment only two of them are dependent.  Her husband V\u00edctor works as a taxi driver.\r\n\r\nNow she's asking the institution for a loan to be able to invest in her greenhouse because thanks to the loan she'll be able to buy vegetable, daisy, and rubber seeds, and pipes and hoses.\r\n\r\nShe says that thanks to some support she received she has the possibility of setting up her greenhouse.  The support will help her buy only some things, though, and the rest Josefa and her husband will have to pay for.  Josefa comments: \"I'm very happy because now I'll be able to have my own greenhouse, only better, and I'll be able to have more vegetables and more profits.\"  Josefa had a greenhouse earlier but it was very small and the vegetables ran out very quickly when she started to sell them.  This was one of the difficulties Josefa had, the vegetables ran out very quickly and she didn't have the money to expand her greenhouse.\r\n\r\nJosefa's dream is to one day be able to expand her greenhouse to earn more profits and sell wholesale to the markets in her town.  If Josefa realizes her dream, it would help her improve her family's quality of life because her children would be able to finish their professional studies.  It would also benefit the condition of her house. \r\n\r\nJosefa and her husband are very grateful to VisionFund and Kiva for the trust they have placed in her by giving her a loan.  They work very hard to achieve their dreams.  They're especially committed to not giving a bad impression and to making all the payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1254314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Now that she has two children she has to find a way of supporting them and earning a little more money to give them a better quality of life and the opportunity to study in the future.

Natalia says that she has had her shop for a year and, with God's help, she is doing well as she has her own income.  She will use the loan to buy beans, canned goods, rice, washing powder, bath soap, shampoo, sweets, bleach, washing-up liquid, fabric conditioner, air-fresheners, soft drinks, juices and oil to stock up her shop and continue trading.  Natalia hopes that her business will continue to grow and that she will be able to stock more goods and offer a better service to her customers.    \r\n  \r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nLuis Enrique - costume jewellery sales,\r\nDeodora - clothing sales,\r\nArturo \u2013construction work,\r\nJoel - groceries,\r\nRosa \u2013snack sales,\r\nAmelia - chicken sales,\r\nEsperanza - taco restaurant,\r\nAntonio - groceries\r\nMaria de Jesus - costume jewellery sales,\r\nCristina - soft drink sales, \r\nMaria Magdalena - snack sales,\r\nNoemi - costume jewellery sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7350,"image":{"id":1247358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for her grocery shop ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-12-21T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-20T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":7350,"lender_count":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arturo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosa Valeria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Noemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":94000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":7350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":11750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":918.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":23555.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068196},{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":23555.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284936},{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":23555.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199223},{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":23555.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596018}],"funded_date":"2012-12-23T04:56:39Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T13:05:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":510102,"name":"Julince","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julince is a 33-year-old woman who is married to Nixon, a 38-year-old man.

She usually raises piglets for seven to eight months before selling them. The price is around 3,500,000 IDR per pig, depending on their weight. The income from the business enables her to support her family's daily needs since her husband\u2019s income as a mason is insufficient to meet their needs. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Julince has two pigs ready to sell on Christmas and one is being raised. In addition, Julince desires to buy one more piglet and sell petrol to gain extra income. Therefore, she applied for a loan from Tanaoba Lais Manekat Foundation (TLM), amounting to 10,000,000 IDR. She hopes that the loan will help her to be successful in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1260716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

tradicionales de la ciudad de Barranquilla, su temperamento alegre y cordial, la hacen merecedora de una gran popularidad en el barrio y ella la aprovecha para fortalecer sus negocios mediante los cuales se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n de almuerzo y comidas, adem\u00e1s y de vender cervezas y gaseosas en un punto frio,  que es muy concurrido. Su primera iniciativa comercial data de hace 8 a\u00f1os, cuando trabaj\u00f3 en un restaurante del centro de la ciudad y su propietaria se enferm\u00f3,  debiendo cerrarlo. Esto    gener\u00f3  a Onix, la necesidad de trabajar independientemente y estar mas cerca del cuidado de su hija, as\u00ed fue como en su propia casa, empez\u00f3 vendiendo almuerzos y poco a poco hizo crecer su negocio, aport\u00e1ndole su mayor dinamismo y disciplina de trabajo. Cuando inici\u00f3 lo hizo en la \u00e9poca de carnaval y esto fue una oportunidad para medir sus ventas y estimular sus deseos de hacerlo crecer y sacar adelante a su hija, como lo logr\u00f3 pues estudia enfermer\u00eda y muy pronto la terminar\u00e1. En la actualidad sus ventas se han incrementado y su demanda crece cada vez mas, por eso tener un capital de trabajo, para invertir y satisfacer a su clientela, se convierte en todo un desaf\u00edo. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un cedikiva,  primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 materias primas, har\u00e1 mejoramiento del local, para tener un espacio mejor organizado, que despierte a su clientela, el deseo de regresar a su negocio a consumir los productos que ofrece. Su mayor sue\u00f1o de prosperidad es lograr que su hija termine su carrera profesional y que tenga un futuro lleno de muchos \u00e9xitos. ","en":"Onix is 50 and lives with her 26-year-old daughter is one of the most traditional areas of Barranquilla, a pleasant and welcoming city. She is very popular in her neighborhood, and she takes advantage of this to grow her business selling prepared foods and cold beer and sodas. She started her business eight years ago when the owner of the restaurant where she worked became ill and closed the business. Onix, therefore, had to work on her own and needed to care for her daughter. She began to sell lunches from her house and slowly grew the business by putting her energy and effort behind it. \r\n\r\nShe began the business during carnival season, which gave her a chance to gauge sales and instilled in her the desire to grow it to support her daughter, who will soon finish her nursing courses. Her sales and demand continue to grow, and having capital to invest and satisfy her customers is a challenge. This is why she approached Kiva for a loan, her first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the loan to buy commodities and renovate and reorganize her space. She hopes this will inspire customers to come back to enjoy the food she serves. Her great dream is that her daughter finishes her studies and enjoys a successful future.

She is married and has three children, two of them are currently in school. For the past 6 years, Pamellah has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt, apples and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Pamellah has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase essential commodities such as milk, apples, cooking oil, sugar and salt to attract more customers, and will help Pamellah to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Pamellah hopes that in the future she will be able to open up another wholesale business. \r\n\r\nPamellah is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like Pamellah, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1260743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her loan requests were rejected each time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salary earned by Ekaterine\u2019s husband, who works as an artisan. <p>\r\n\r\nEkaterine requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan proceeds, Ekaterine would like to purchase clothes at wholesale prices so that she can re-sell them in her district for a profit.

He has been able to pay his expenses through this work for the past seven years. He likes working with his father in a family business since he feels he is helping them while earning an income to meet his own expenses. He's not pleased when pests and disease attack the harvest, but he hires workers to look for and control any damage to the crops. He is an experienced cook and plans to open a restaurant in the city with his profits.\r\n\r\nThis will be his fourth loan cycle with MFP, and he is pleased and grateful for the financing for his business. He is happy to belong to his communal bank because most of the members are neighbors and all are responsible. The loan of 2200 nuevos soles will be used to invest in the business he shares with his father as the planting season approaches to ensure a good harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1261947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Below is the story of Rose's group.  Rose is the one whose hand is raised.<p>\r\n\r\nRose is a 35-year-old, married woman with eight children. Six of her children are in school. To earn a living, she operates a retail shop, where she sells pork in the outskirts of Kagadi town. Her major clients are residents of Kisenyi, a suburb of Kagadi where she operates. She explains that she started the business in 1993 in an effort to increase income for her family. Rose's major challenge is insufficient capital, which makes it difficult to meet her clients' demands for pork products.<p>\r\n\r\nRose is seeking a loan in the amount of 400,000 UGX. With the loan proceeds, she plans to purchase additional piglets so that she increase her family's earnings. Her dream is to construct a permanent residential house for the family and to make sure that her children are educated at a higher institution of learning. She is thankful that UGAFODE came at the time that her group members needed financial services; indeed, she feels that UGAFODE's appearance in their lives answered their prayers. The group collectively believes that they will make good use of the money this Christmas and that the returns will be signficant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1260793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

His goal is to increase his income and this is why he gets up every day with a lot of enthusiasm to carry on and fill it with happiness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1261953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy toys with cash to sell to his customers who have ordered Christmas presents for their children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-21T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-20T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":70381},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":84328},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86295},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88309},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90369},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92478},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94636},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96844},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99104},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":101416},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":103782},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":122058}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.48,"local_amount":70381,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":72359.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071678},{"amount":48.51,"local_amount":84328,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":86699.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497889},{"amount":49.64,"local_amount":86295,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":88721.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527704},{"amount":50.8,"local_amount":88309,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":90792,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928454},{"amount":51.98,"local_amount":90369,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":92909.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705608},{"amount":53.2,"local_amount":92478,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":95078.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967896},{"amount":114.11,"local_amount":198374,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-24T08:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":203951.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817096},{"amount":119.83,"local_amount":208316,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":214173.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323375},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":104125,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":107052.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082624},{"amount":61.56,"local_amount":107025,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":110034.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062023}],"funded_date":"2012-12-31T09:21:22Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:27:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":510162,"name":"Vjollca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vjollca is a 45-year-old, married woman.

Typical dress and the native language are still very common. The women chose this group name because where they live used to be a ranch called \"Rancher\u00eda\". \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Yolanda, who is the group's representative, is 35 years old. She has been married for 14 years to Alejandro, who works in construction. They have three school-aged children. Do\u00f1a Yolanda, for the last 20 years, has made a living raising sheep. She owns eight sheep and with this loan, she plans to buy four more, as well as feed for them. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Yolanda mentions that \"I began raising sheep because as a young girl, I learned from my mother how to take care of them and raise them. I saw that this was a good way to make money.\" Do\u00f1a Yolanda is a very warm and happy person because thanks to her earnings from this work, she has been able to help improve her family's quality of life. The only obstacle she's faced so far has been disease among the animals, which sometimes kills her sheep, causing her to lose income.

He lives with Mar\u00eda, who is a merchant and the mother of their two children who are 14 and 6 years old. He loves them very much. They live together in their own home, along with his mother. Walter sells spare parts and services vehicles, so he has a multi-service shop located in a building that he rents. Here, he attends to the requests of his customers, who count on him to repair their vehicles. He provides good service and the new parts that they need.\r\n\r\nHe began over 10 years ago with his own capital by buying and selling in small quantities. Then, he would increase his stock of merchandise from his earnings. Currently, he also counts on help from his partner in the shop. He considers his business to be pretty successful due to the income he makes and the demand for his products. His shop is located in a busy, commercial area.\r\n\r\nDeciding to start a business was one of Walter's goals in life. This economic activity was a venture of his partner's, who he encouraged to increase income and not overlook necessities.

London\u201d because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in the winter, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6675,"image":{"id":1261960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
