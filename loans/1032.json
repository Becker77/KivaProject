She lives with Gabriel, who is a truck driver, and the father of her daughter, who is now independent. They live comfortably together in their own house. Margarita sells soft drinks, for which she has a freezer in her own home, where she can keep her product at a temperature that her customers like. They buy from her every day. She has been working in this business for more than ten years. When her daughter visits, she has her help to sell the product to the customers. \r\nWhat she likes about her job is the income that she makes, and that she can support her family with some earnings. She also likes the free time that she has and can use for other activities. On the other hand, what she doesn't like is that some customers, already being drunk, become somewhat disrespectful. She says that in this business, one can't lose, because it's a highly-consumed product. It is in demand at every social activity. This is why she has plans to expand her both her business and the place where she serves her customers. This will be her third loan from MFP. Margarita is grateful for the loan to continue with her business. She wants to continue receiving more loans. This is why she is committed to making her payments on time. \r\nShe also feels very content in her communal bank, because she considers the members to be supportive and committed to their responsibilities. With the amount she applied for, 1200 nuevos soles, she will invest in purchasing merchandise like soft drinks of various flavors and brands, looking for low prices for the volume of her purchases. This way, she hopes to increase her profit margin.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1261986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy soft drinks of different flavors and brands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-21T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-20T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":179.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":189.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":199.14},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":202.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":211.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":217.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.18,"local_amount":179.82,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":182.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573094},{"amount":74.92,"local_amount":189.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":192.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122736},{"amount":78.83,"local_amount":199.14,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":202.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577393},{"amount":80.23,"local_amount":202.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":205.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529630},{"amount":169.84,"local_amount":429.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":435.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975925}],"funded_date":"2012-12-22T05:20:37Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":510214,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter used his previous loan of 30,000 KES to boost his building supply business and this increased his monthly income from 64,000 KES to 80,000 KES.

Several times, he has requested loans from local financial institutions for his trading business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salary earned by Gela working as a miner. As well, Gela\u2019s wife gets a relevant pension from the local government as she is a mother of many children. The income is enough only for food for the six member family. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Gela and his wife requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Gela will purchase clothes at wholesale prices and resell them in his district for a profit.

Before she started her business, Yudy lived for a year in the United States. With her hard work, she was able to save and she began to sell merchandise from that country. When she returned to Colombia, she continued this activity because she had a large number of customers in Sincelejo, a city also located on the Caribbean coast. Little by little, she went strengthening her business and today she has been able to maintain it and generate more income with which she contributes to the wellbeing of her home. Her main customers are employees of private and public businesses, who are familiar with her system of selling on credit and are part of a healthy loan portfolio. \r\nCurrently, her orders are greater than her ability to fill them in a timely manner. This is why she is applying for a Kiva loan. This is the first round of financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will buy blouses, sweaters, handbags, perfumes, and pants, which will make her family and her customers look elegant for Christmas and the New Year, when they hope to show off their elegance and distinction and to await 2013 with plenty of happiness and unity in her

The loan will be used to buy more fresh fish for reselling, and will help Rose to generate greater profits to pay school fees and cover her family's basic needs. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to own the biggest fish selling market. \r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

The only source of income for the family is the small monthly amount earned by Manana\u2019s son, who has a horse and serves local farmers in land cultivation and transportation. Manana requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provisions for business start-ups and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Manana will purchase clothes and bedding at wholesale prices and resell them in her district for a profit. It will be hard work for Manana, but according to her estimates, her business will be profitable and will increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in her clothing trading business to increase her stock and sales volume.

con Hugo de 56 a\u00f1os. Con quien tiene 3 hijos ya adultos. Mar\u00eda se educ\u00f3 con sus padres que aunque de escasos recursos, le pudieron al menos regalar parte de su educaci\u00f3n y tambi\u00e9n le ense\u00f1aron todo sobre la agricultura, con la cual Mar\u00eda podr\u00eda obtener el sustento. Ahora Mar\u00eda vive con su c\u00f3nyuge en la ciudad de El Puyo, cant\u00f3n capital de la Provincia de Pastaza, una provincia que forma parte importante de la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica del Ecuador, siendo el centro de la selva amaz\u00f3nica. En su capital Puyo se puede gozar de un agradable clima y un paisaje esplendoroso con r\u00edos, cascadas diversidad de fauna y flora por lo que turistas nacionales y extranjeros llegan a deleitarse de estos c\u00e1lidos atractivos. Por ser el turismo una de las actividades econ\u00f3micas m\u00e1s importantes, en el centro de la ciudad se encuentra f\u00e1cilmente todos los servicios para acoger al turista como son hoteles, hoster\u00edas, restaurantes, instituciones financieras, etc. Tambi\u00e9n los habitantes se dedican a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda que son favorecidas con la tierra f\u00e9rtil que posee este lugar. Sin duda El Puyo es una ciudad que vale la pena visitar ya que ha crecido mucho en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os por el esp\u00edritu emprendedor y trabajador de su gente. \nAl ser la agricultura una actividad importante en la zona, Mar\u00eda se ha dedicado a trabajar en este negocio desde hace 5 a\u00f1os. Dedica los fines de semana 10 horas a la venta de yuca, pl\u00e1tano y ca\u00f1a y aunque los otros d\u00edas tambi\u00e9n realiza ciertos tipos de cuidado a los sembr\u00edos, ella paralelamente a la agricultura atiende una tienda de v\u00edveres de cuyos ingresos tiene el sustento para todos los d\u00edas. Ahora Mar\u00eda quiere que esta tienda est\u00e9 m\u00e1s surtida ya que con la experiencia que ha ido adquiriendo sabe los productos que son m\u00e1s demandados por sus clientes y con los cuales a veces no cuenta en stock. Por esta raz\u00f3n Mar\u00eda necesita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar mercader\u00eda al por mayor para ofrecer variedad de productos en su tienda y con esto obtener mayores ingresos que le ayuden a sustentar los gastos legales para formalizar los documentos que avalan la propiedad de los terrenos en donde ella trabaja. Mar\u00eda es una mujer emprendedora y trabajadora que no se ha visto limitada por ning\u00fan obst\u00e1culo y es por esto que agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por la ayuda y la confianza que le han brindado. ","en":"Mar\u00eda is a 49 year old woman. She studied at primary school and she is married to Hugo who is 56 years old with whom she has three grown children. Mar\u00eda was brought up by her parents, and although they had scarce resources, at least they gave her some education and they also taught her about agriculture so that Mar\u00eda could obtain a living.\r\n\r\nNow Mar\u00eda lives with her husband in the city of El Puyo, the capital of the canton of Pastaza Province, a province that is an important part of the Amazon region of Ecuador, in the center of the Amazon jungle.\r\n\r\nIn the capital of Puyo one can enjoy a pleasant climate and a splendid landscape with rivers, waterfalls, and a variety of flora and fauna which nationals and foreign tourists visit to enjoy themselves at these warm attractions.\r\n\r\nSince tourism is one of the most important economic activities, in the city center can easily be found all the tourist services such as hotels, hostels, restaurants, banks, etc. Also, the local people work in agriculture and livestock that are favored because of the fertile land that this place has. Puyo is a city worth visiting as it has grown a lot in the last years through the entrepreneurial spirit and hard work of its people.\r\n\r\nSince agriculture is an important activity in the area, Mar\u00eda has been doing this work for 5 years. She works 10 hours on the weekends selling cassava, bananas and sugarcane and although the other days she also takes particular steps caring for her crops, at the same time she attends to a grocery store whose income takes care of everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNow Mar\u00eda wants to supply this store as through the experience that she has acquired she knows the products that are the most demanded by her clients and which she sometimes does not have in stock. This is why Mar\u00eda needs a loan to buy merchandise at wholesale in order to offer a variety of products in her store and thus obtain better income to help her cover the legal expenses to execute the documents to endorse the ownership of the land where she works.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is an enterprising and hardworking woman who has not been overcome by any obstacle and this is why she is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternative for the help and trust that they have given.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1262102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy groceries to stock the small store which she maintains during the weekdays.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Puyo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-12-22T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-21T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":844.8,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":74.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":87.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":90.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.75,"local_amount":74.29,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":74.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516833},{"amount":81.05,"local_amount":80.56,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":81.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068688},{"amount":83.23,"local_amount":82.72,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":83.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494955},{"amount":168.39,"local_amount":167.36,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":168.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524883},{"amount":85.93,"local_amount":85.4,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":85.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313729},{"amount":87.35,"local_amount":86.82,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":87.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565335},{"amount":88.46,"local_amount":87.92,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":88.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814380},{"amount":89.76,"local_amount":89.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":89.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320559},{"amount":91.08,"local_amount":90.52,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":91.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856255}],"funded_date":"2012-12-22T03:50:04Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T15:09:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":510374,"name":"Anna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anna is 48 years old and lives in Congo Town in Montserrado County, home to Liberia\u2019s largest city, Freeport.

The lady standing in the middle wearing a cream-colored sari with a red floral print in the photo is Lili. Lili is 32 years old and is staying with her husband and her four children. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in cultivation for a long time. She got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighborhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took on leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. Initially, she started growing only a few vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, and onions, but later on she grew bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumbers, ladyfingers and brinjal (eggplant). She has a very good relationship with her customers as she sells fresh vegetables to her customers. Now she has a new idea of purchasing some more land for cultivation so that she can grow more vegetables on a large scale, for which she has requested a loan to purchase land, seeds and fertilizers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1260851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase land, fertilizers, seeds, manure etc. for vegetable cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Balugaon, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2012-12-22T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-21T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":181,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lili ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmabati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadambini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chhaila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subarna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taoopai ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saradha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarmista ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhasi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumitra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lopha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-23T19:52:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":510536,"name":"Charity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charity sells fish and jewelry at Wegbe near Hohoe.

The group leader Sarin was so satisfied with the previous loans that she obtained and successfully paid back because, with those loans, she was able to build an appropriate house in which her family can live. Now with this new requested loan portion, Sarin will spend on building a proper latrine for consumption in the family. Via the help of this loan, Sarin will be able to create a healthy environment not only for herself but for her whole family.

Kenkey is a traditional Ghanaian meal which is made with corn flour and requires fermentation in order to create its unique flavor.It is usually served with a soup, stew, or sauce. It is produced by cooking fermented corn\/maize dough wrapped in maize husk and steamed. \r\n\r\nGrace has received education though middle school. She is married and has given birth to 3 children.

Several times, she has requested loans from local financial institutions for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly refugee pension from the local government and the monthly salary earned by Manana\u2019s nephew, who works as a mini-bus driver locally. Besides, Manana works as daily worker seasonally. Manana requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Manana will purchase clothes at wholesale prices and resell them in her district for a profit.

his story: \n\nRESTIO ENERGY Company is a registered company and a leading energy for development consultancy, based in Somerset West, South Africa. The company was founded in 2001 and has since led and participated in numerous consultancy and project development initiatives across the SACD and East African region. RESTIO is understanding energy poverty and developing sustainable solutions to address these realities. RESTIO works principally in the \u2018off-grid\u2019 and \u2018low-income\u2019 sector covering the fields of renewable energy and liquid fuels for both electric power and thermal energy in order to provide these communities with access to an integrated and sustainable energy solution.\n\nRESTIO ENERGY was set up by Robert. He is a leading development consultant in the African renewable energy industry with specializations in sustainable energy service business models, the productive use of renewable energy, energy and development programme evaluations, and energy project feasibility studies. He has worked with a host of development organizations, including the World Bank, United Nations, Millennium Challenge Account, GVEP-I and GIZ. He holds an MSc degree in Environmental Change and Management from the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, as well as a Master of Social Science degree in Social Anthropology. He also serves on the Consumer Working Group of the Global Cookstove Alliance.\n\nThe need for affordable and clean energy among the South Africans not connected to the grid in the townships was the idea behind starting RESTIO and the commitment to promoting original, financially sustainable and accessible solutions to a range of energy related problems and challenges. According to Robert, \u201cWe understand that energy is an essential element in achieving sustainable development and we aim to understand and address the obstacles impeding the successful delivery. We focus on a broad range of market opportunities, from working with those facing energy poverty to more mainstream opportunities in commercial, agricultural and industrial arenas. Working with a client profile including private, public and non-governmental organizations, we develop, promote and distribute energy solutions that inform, present income-generating opportunities, and offer convenience and value for money.\n\n\"We aim to reduce the use of candles and paraffin lanterns, which will in turn reduce accidental fires as well as accidental ingestion of paraffin. We also believe that current illumination options, in addition to the dangers, are more expensive in the long-run than Barefoot Power products.\" \n\nImportantly, the presence and use of Barefoot Power products within these rural households will provide an invaluable demonstration of the effectiveness and performance of PV-based lighting products in communities where such products currently have very little traction. This will be used to further stimulate the demand for these products.\n\nThe loan will be used toward the cost of procurement of 1,800 Firefly Mobile Lamps from Barefoot Power. This will assist with the cash flow requirements for the purchase and distribution of the Firefly Mobile Lamps to individuals and communities in six provinces in South Africa, supported by a government contract through the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR). Through it, RESTIO will be in a position to reach 1,700 people in remote areas through a coordinated formal distribution as dictated by the DRDLR.\n\nIn order for the Firefly Mobile Lamps to become increasingly accessible to all markets, RESTIO requires economies of scale, so the more people who benefit from the use thereof, the more this will contribute to RESTIO building a sustainable mode of distribution in order to grow the market.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":16200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16200,"image":{"id":1253984,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2814,"youtubeId":"4k1YhPGcd8c","title":"Kiva Borrower Robert from South Africa","thumbnailImageId":1253984},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy and sell Barefoot Power's solar lighting products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Somerset West","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2012-12-22T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-21T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":16200,"lender_count":502,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":16200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":16200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4860},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":11340}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4860},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11340}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16200,"local_amount":16200,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-26T08:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399745537}],"funded_date":"2012-12-24T22:21:33Z","paid_date":"2013-10-26T08:34:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":510690,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is still married to Margret, and he says that his wife and children are all fine.

is 48 years old.

Besides this, Koba grows potatoes and carrots on his agricultural land. He is a very hard-working man, with a rich experience in his work. Koba is requesting credit to start-up a trade business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Koba will purchase a mini-bus to trade his harvested potatoes. This will save the costs of transportation. Besides this, he will purchase various greengrocery products from local farmers at wholesale prices and sell them in nearby towns with a price mark-up. This new business initiative will increase Koba's monthly income. His living conditions will improve and in the future, he will have enough income to access regular credit products available in his country\u2019s capital market, if

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and meats cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJosephine hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams to have a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

With an enormous database of fun and innovative graphics, Llama Ink offers hundreds of pre-made custom design options for t-shirts, hoodies and tote bags. The company\u2019s vision is to dress people with innovative products made in the USA, allowing them to express themselves in a fun and creative way, while supporting the local economy. \r\n\r\nLacking the capital needed to get their company fully operational, the couple sought help from Accion San Diego, a local microlender.  Despite having no credit history, Eric was able to secure a $5,000 Kiva loan to be used to purchase equipment and invest in marketing and inventory. \r\n\r\nWhat Eric and Gilaine love most about their new venture is that it allows them to express their creativity, while working from home with their children. They hope to grow their business to the point where they can create new jobs, helping others who are where they once were. They also would like to give back to their community by donating a shirt for every shirt sold.  \r\n\r\nFind Llama Ink online at:

He is 28 years old, single and lives with his sister, brother and parents. Shota and his brother are electricians and receive small monthly salaries. The family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, Shota runs a small dairy farm; he has a calf and two milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. In addition, he grows maize and haricots on the family-owned land. The harvested products, as well as the cheese, are sold at the local open market.

She is a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Rodrigo, an anime maker, and they have children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMarites maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these provide income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Marites earns a minimum of Php2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarites hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams of having a good life for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

and planting rubber, especially the lower part (Compound #3). He is 37 years old, a high school graduate, and has been managing his business since 2006. He has been successful with his business, which has enabled him to buy a piece of land and build a shop. Since his demand is increasing, he is requesting a loan to buy more fashionable clothes, rice by the bag, soft drinks by the crate, Argo-oil by the gallon, etc. to meet his customer's demands. His passion has increased over the years because his shop is the shopping place for the people of Compound #3.

She lives with Kevin who works as an employee, and who is father of her 3 children; Kein, who is 9 years old, Arison, 3, and Adriana, who is 4 months.  She lives with her partner and children, whom she adores, and who are the reason that she wants to get on in life. They live in their own house, which Nilda managed to build with her partner. Nilda\u2019s business is the sale of foodstuffs and general groceries, which she sells from a little shop that she was able to fit out in her own house. Nilda recognised her neighbours\u2019 necessity to be able to get the things that they needed somewhere closer, without having to travel great distances to do their shopping. Nilda buys all her products in the shopping centres in the city and sells them in the shop in her house.\r\nHer shop has been open for more than a year now, during which time she has managed to make herself known in the neighbourhood and build up a regular clientele. Up until now, she has been able to put all of this into effect with the help of her partner, who serves customers in his spare moments.\r\nLinda considers her business to be quite worthwhile because of the profits that it provides, as she has regular customers who always buy her products.\r\nShe likes her business because it means that she can stay at home to look after her small children. This was the main reason for her decision to open a shop at home, because before, she worked on a market stall.  \r\nHowever, she has plans to increase her stock of products and to run parallel to this business, a soda fountain.  Therefore, this will be loan number 3 with the institution MFP. She feels pleased with the opportunity offered to her; to be able to count on working capital. She wants to be able to continue to rely on this support, and for this reason, she promises to be punctual with the payments. Apart from this, she feels comfortable with the community bank because of the mutual support that they offer each other.\r\nWith the amount of 1000 New Soles, which she is applying for, Nilda intends to buy a greater variety of foods and groceries, looking to get better prices by buying in bulk. In this way, she can be more competitive in her pricing, and increase the stock available for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1262733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of groceries.

Se decidi\u00f3 por \u00e9sta actividad por la necesidad de tener un oficio para contar con un ingreso econ\u00f3mico para solventar los gastos del su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, adem\u00e1s de poder manejar su propio horario de trabajo.

He lives with Arita, who is a shopkeeper, and mother to his three children, who are 21, 18 and 10 years old. He lives comfortably in his own home, in the company of his partner and children, whom he loves very much, and who are his motivation in life. Cesar works repairing mobile phones of all the different makes. Every morning, at 5 am, he goes to market number 2, where he has a small stand, and where he serves his customers warmly. He has been running this business for more than 6 years. He can count on the help of a friend, when he has a lot of repairs to do, and in this way, he can deliver all of the mobiles on time.\r\nHe likes his business because it keeps him busy, and allows him to make use of what he has learnt at training school. He decided upon this business because of the necessity of having a trade, in order to be able to rely upon an income, to cover the costs of his home and the education of his children. Apart from that, he wanted to be able to be in control of his own working hours. On the other hand, Cesar comments that it is very inconvenient when his customers don\u2019t collect the mobile phones, that they have left for repair, on time.  This means that he has to store them, and they take up space in his store, which is very small. But this doesn\u2019t discourage him, and he carries on working, with plans to carry on in this business and to grow. Therefore, this will be loan number 1 with the institution MFP. He is counting on their collaboration, in order to be able to continue with his goals.

She also has a lot of experience in business.  She lives with her partner, Gustavo, who works as a merchant, and their two children, ages 8 and 21.  Together they all live comfortably in their own home.\r\n\r\nLupe\u2019s business is selling fresh fish in the mornings that she buys from her city\u2019s fishing port.  She sells the fish as a travelling vendor using a tricycle equipped with a loudspeaker, which she uses to offer her products.  She uses the tricycle to transport her products through the streets of the settlements and new towns.  She also has a mototaxi that she rents to a driver for an average of 25 nuevos soles per day, in this way generating some additional income.\r\n\r\nLupe began her business more than three years ago with some of her own capital and then gradually expanded it with the help of loans.  Her partner also helps her with her sales.\r\n\r\nHer business generates profits for her as she generally sells everything she carries with her to sell.\r\n\r\nShe says that she decided to start her business because she needed a trade, since she does not have a profession.  She needs the money she earns from her business to pay for the education of her children, which she believes is the best inheritance she can leave them.  Moreover, compared to her previous work, her business earns her more profit each day.\r\n\r\nTherefore, given her positive results, she would like to continue earning a living with her business.  This will be her first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and with their assistance she hopes to further her goals.  Moreover, she says she is happy with her communal bank because they are a committed and united team.\r\n\r\nLupe will use the requested 600 nuevos soles to buy fish in larger quantities and to repair her motocart."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1262739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of fish in larger quantities and to repair her motocart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-23T12:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-22T12:40:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":89.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":94.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":98.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":107.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":110.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.15,"local_amount":89.17,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":95.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573097},{"amount":39.48,"local_amount":94.74,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":101.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122739},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":98.72,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":105.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868564},{"amount":41.44,"local_amount":99.46,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":106.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577396},{"amount":44.6,"local_amount":107.02,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":114.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529633},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":110.89,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":118.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974675}],"funded_date":"2012-12-23T19:07:13Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":510848,"name":"Luciana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luciana is a woman of thirty-two years.
