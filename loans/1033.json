a father to three sons and two daughters.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Majdi has been a rickshaw driver, which is the only source of income to him and his family.\r\n\r\nMajdi wants to improve and expand his work as a rickshaw driver and use the rickshaw not only for transferring customers but also to transfer goods from one area to another.\r\n\r\nMajdi is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing and installing a trailer to the rickshaw he drives. Taking this loan will create for Majdi another new path in his work, which will enable him to work extra hours and take additional requests, which will increase his income and improve the family's living conditions for the better.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Bat herself formerly worked in boot factories but in 2009 she retired and has been receiving benefits. Also she cares for her daughter\u2019s girls at home. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land and this summer they began to build an extension to their house. But due to their financial situation the family has not completed the extension and as winter comes to Mongolia, it will become a source of heat loss. So Bat is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to complete the extension. As a result, the family will be able to live in a warm and comfortable environment; furthermore they will burn less coal and thus contribute to efforts against air pollution."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":1263200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"to complete an extension to the family home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-12-24T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-23T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":396800},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":410060.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":426779.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":432543.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":445320.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":454589.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":433905.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":313.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":287.68,"local_amount":396800,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":398436.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339501222},{"amount":297.29,"local_amount":410060.69,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":411752.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347053385},{"amount":309.42,"local_amount":426779.82,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":428540.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355799131},{"amount":313.59,"local_amount":432543.81,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":434328.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364507483},{"amount":322.86,"local_amount":445320.79,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":447157.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372912644},{"amount":329.58,"local_amount":454589.05,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":456464.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381690297},{"amount":305.75,"local_amount":433905.84,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":435695.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.83,"payment_id":390553063}],"funded_date":"2012-12-25T05:25:05Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:50:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Seiji Humphries","image":null}},{"id":511261,"name":"Irum's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irum is a 34-year-old woman who lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her husband, daughter and son.

She is divorced and has five children.  She divorced 12 years ago and since then she has been fending for her five children alone.  With an aim to finding suitable work, several years ago she left for the Russian Federation.  There she worked and sent money home to her children.  Her children missed her very much and asked her to come home, because they didn't have anyone besides her.  \r\n\r\nMaysara returned to her homeland and started to look for work since caring for five children takes a lot of money.  She learned from her neighbors about a course called \"Attain Success,\" which is put on by the Association of Business Women and teaches women how to start their own businesses.  Maysara went through this training and got her graduation certificate.  She has owned her own business for six months now.  She owns a cafe.  Now, she wants to develop her business by installing an audio recorder and karaoke machine to attract more customers.  Using her profits, Maysara plans to provide her children with good educations and calorie-rich foods.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 10,000 somoni (TJS) for the purchase for an audio recorder and karaoke machine in order to develop her new business.  She is relying on your

He is married and has three children.  They live in a large, traditional family in Kabo\u00efla I, a popular neighborhood of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nTahirou didn't have the opportunity to go to school.  He started buying and selling items at a young age.  For more than a year he has been buying and selling fuel (gas, diesel, lamp oil).  Tahirou has a sales location which is doing very well and he is very well liked by his customers.  Given the lack of resources, he sees himself as being unable to meet his customer demand which is continually growing.  For this reason, he joined Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution and his first loan will be used to boost his business.  This will allow him to better satisfy his customer demand and increase customer loyalty.\r\n\r\nTahirou will use this loan to buy six 20-liter containers of gas and eight 20-liter containers of diesel at the pump here in Sikasso in order to sell them retail to a customer base who mainly own two-wheeled vehicles.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Tahirou plans to make a monthly profit of 90,000 francs.  The income he makes from this business will allow him to repay his loan and meet his family's needs.  He will invest the rest in his

Yatoufa is a polygamist.  He has two wives and nine children.  He lives with his two wives and children in Sanoubougou I, a popular neighborhood of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nYatoufa did not have the opportunity to go to school and, after having run a number of businesses without much success, he started selling timber around six years ago.  He buys his timber in neighboring areas.  With the experience he has in his field, he has built up a strong reputation and receives a lot of orders.  However, he lacks the resources he needs to satisfy his customers' needs.  For this reason, he decided to join Soro Yiriwaso's loan program.  This is his third loan and he will use it to increase his working capital so that he can better respond to his customers' demands.

He lives in Khan Younis in a small house. \r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Mohammad has had a cosmetics store which contains beauty products, perfumes and other cosmetics products. This store is a very successful project and earns a pretty good income, but some times it needs more liquidity to buy more products.\r\n\r\nMohammad took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN. This loan will help Mohammad to buy more products for his store, which will increase his sales and therefore increase his income positively. This will ensure Mohammad a better future. \r\n\r\nMohammad appears in the photo. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending page:

As the family has to wait until spring to gather harvest and sell it, it is very difficult for them to cover their daily operational costs. Yeghishe has applied for this loan to expand his livestock. With the requested amount he will purchase a cow and forage for feeding the livestock.

Otari has requested several previous loans from local financial institutions for his family business start-up without any success. His loan request has been rejected many times because of his low income and lack of experience in his new business. \r\n\r\nThe family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have a small dairy farm of 2 milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. The cheese is sold locally. Additionally, Otari owns a vineyard and a plot of land where maize is grown. Otari is also involved in a flour-trading business and gets monthly income. \r\n\r\nOtari is requesting a loan from Credo to re-start-up his family business which he had to stop due to financial problems. He will use his loan to purchase pigs to start an animal husbandry business. He will put the pigs in a shed in the yard, raise them and will be able to sell piglets for a good price. Otari's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country rural poor who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income.

His colleagues respect him a lot because he is an honest person. Every month when he receives his salary, he hurries to the store to go shopping. He spends all of his money just providing for his family. He is unable to save up to buy furniture and modern appliances for his home. With each passing year his children are getting older, and he has to meet their growing needs. Dilshod is seeking a loan in the amount of 3,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy household furnishings, particularly for his children. This loan will help him to create comfortable living conditions at home. Being a conscientious person, he promises to pay off the loan on time.

good woman. She is 42, married, and has 2 children who are 20 and 14 years old. Her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation. For the past 25 years, Ugiloy has been working as an economist in an employment centre, where she is one of the most successful employees. She has very nice and smart children. Her eldest son Muhammadzhon is in his 3rd year of studies at the Slavonic State University of Tajikistan. Ugiloy's salary and her husband's earnings are not sufficient to cover the costs of their son's tuition fees, so Ugiloy is seeking a loan to pay for his studies. She and Muhammadzhon are waiting for your kindness.

Fourteen years ago, Ainura began working in animal husbandry to provide additional income to her family. She started by buying one heifer, and today her farm has two cows and one calf.  It produces an income of 10,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products. In order to further develop her business, Ainura turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of  70,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional cattle.

","en":"Gulayim is 41 years old and married. Ten years ago, she was looking for a way to support her family and so began her cattle breeding business. Using 10,000 som (KGS) as starting capital to buy cattle, Gulayim was able to start her farm, which produces a monthly income of about 6,000 som (KGS). She makes additional income working as a hairdresser. In order to further develop her business, Gulayim turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy cows and calves. With the profit she makes from this loan, Gulayim plans to increase her livestock in the near future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1263870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Her name is Umida and she is 24 years old, married, and she has two children.  Her husband is a farmer and earns a very small income that isn't enough to provide the family with all the necessities.  Since Umida is a seamstress and knows how to sew traditional women's dresses and traditional\r\nfuton-like mattresses called a \"kurpacha,\" she decided to use her craft to help her husband with the family's well-being. \r\n\r\nShe used to not have any knowledge about business.  But not long ago, a friend of hers told her about a course called \"Attain Success\" put on by the Associaiton for Business Women, where women learn how to write a business plan and start a business.   Umida studied in the course and received a graduation certificate.

He lives in the Akhalkalaki District with his mother. He has asked for loans from local financial institutions to start up a new business several times but has not had success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and lack of experience in his job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers.\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the small monthly income earned by Gevorg\u2019s mother working as a cleaner locally. Gevorg used to have a business where different kinds of fruits and vegetables were sold, but he stopped this because he joined military service. He has recently returned from service and decided to restart his trading business, but his current savings are not enough to implement his plan.\r\nHis loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credit with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Gevorg will purchase fruit and vegetables at wholesale prices and take them to sell at his open market store. Gevorg plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of his family. Gevorg will work hard and will be able to improve the living conditions for himself and his family. Along with the above mentioned, the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available in the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

is an energetic young woman.  She is 19 years old.  She isn't married and lives with her parents.  Since her childhood, she has always dreamed of becoming a wealthy businesswoman.  She studied in a course on dressmaking and she already has several years of experience in this field.  She now wants to turn her handicraft into a business.  With this aim, she studied in a course called \"Attain Success\" that is put on by the Association of Business Women, and she received her graduation certificate.  She is fully capable of starting her own business since she has the skills for this field.  \r\n\r\nShohida will sew traditional women's dresses and sell them at the local market.  She plans to make and sell 75 dresses per month, as well as taking special orders for dresses from local residents.  She is requesting a loan for 1,500 somoni (TJS) to buy a sewing machine and fabric in order to start her new business.  She is relying on your kindness. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1263904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a sewing machine to start a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-25T08:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-24T08:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shohida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":104.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":114.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":117.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":126.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":128.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":134.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":138.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":142.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":146.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.85},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.86,"local_amount":105.5,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":108.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740992},{"amount":23.57,"local_amount":108.77,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":112.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056286},{"amount":25.13,"local_amount":116,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":119.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801981},{"amount":25.33,"local_amount":116.9,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":120.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510225},{"amount":26.09,"local_amount":120.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":124.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915508},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":123.09,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":126.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693221},{"amount":27.67,"local_amount":127.72,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":131.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556023},{"amount":28.06,"local_amount":129.51,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":133.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549881},{"amount":29.46,"local_amount":135.99,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":140.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410958853},{"amount":90.16,"local_amount":416.11,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":429.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075019}],"funded_date":"2012-12-25T11:11:43Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T09:48:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":511511,"name":"Al-Taisir Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Al-Taisir which consists of five women who live in Sana`a, Yemen.

She was born and raised in this village and she is very well adapted to the village way of life.  She knows all the ins and outs of eastern life and she skillfully uses her know-how to put her plans into action in the village setting.  Guliston is married and has one child.  She always tries her hardest for the family's well-being.  She starts doing household chores early in the morning and she bakes such big and tasty flatbreads that her husband calls them \"finger-licking good.\"\r\n\r\nDespite their support of one another, Guliston and her husband aren't able to improve their living conditions, so Guliston decided to start her own business for the family's well-being.  With this aim, she studied in a course called \"Attain Success\" that is put on by the Association of Business Women, and she received her graduation certificate.

The only source of income for the family is the small monthly income earned by Lamara, who is involved in a clothing trading business. \r\n\r\nShe buys clothing in Turkey and resells these items to local retailers. Lamara requested a loan from Credo to start up her own store and sell the clothing herself. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

The only source of income for her is the small monthly income she earns by working as a cleaner locally. Nino has requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on reasonable terms for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. Nino will purchase clothes in the capital city at wholesale prices and resell them in her village for a profit. It will be hard work for Nino but, according to estimates, her business will be profitable and will increase her income. The increased profit will be reinvested in her clothing trading business to increase her stock and sales volume.

Many people prefer his store because he provides the best possible customer service.\r\n\r\nAdib's dream is to see his store flourish. Due to the current bad situation in Yemen, he has less profit from his enterprise.

He comes with good credit references and has faith in God that with your help and his own arduous work, he will be able to provide a better quality of life for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1264286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farming supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-12-26T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-25T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Bautista","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85.55,"local_amount":85.55,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846992},{"amount":264.45,"local_amount":264.45,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":264.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356448500}],"funded_date":"2012-12-26T03:20:18Z","paid_date":"2013-04-19T08:48:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.
