Maria says that working in the country requires lots of sacrifice, but she has much revenue that that she passes to the family and when things are good, the financial gains are very good.\r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s dream is to have a small farm with many heads of livestock so she can be a milk distributor and sell to markets in the surrounding communities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1265976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Ambato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":188,"posted_date":"2012-12-28T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-27T05:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":92.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":102.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.86},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.61,"local_amount":90.61,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":90.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339515059},{"amount":92.49,"local_amount":92.49,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-29T08:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":92.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347066981},{"amount":96.05,"local_amount":96.05,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-01T09:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356674308},{"amount":96.41,"local_amount":96.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-31T08:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":96.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364523243},{"amount":98.83,"local_amount":98.83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":98.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924207},{"amount":100.46,"local_amount":100.46,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-02T09:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":100.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701419},{"amount":102.83,"local_amount":102.83,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-06T08:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":102.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390563904},{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":104.69,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-01T09:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":104.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399812990},{"amount":106.86,"local_amount":106.86,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":106.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410088849},{"amount":110.77,"local_amount":110.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-03T10:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":110.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419854825}],"funded_date":"2012-12-28T09:20:37Z","paid_date":"2013-12-03T10:20:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

","en":"Kishimkan is 59 years old, she is a widow and a mother of seven children. After the collapse of the USSR Kishimkan has received a part of her land. She has been doing animal husbandry and field crop cultivation since 1991 as a main source of income for her family. After her husband's death the entire business has been left to herself and thanks to her son and daughter Kishimkan has been keeping all in order. The business which was started with an amount of 1,000 KGS in 1992 right now has six cows, twenty heads of sheep, 25 goats and three horses which brings around 10,000-12,000 som a month thanks to her hard work and perseverance. With the goal to further grow her business Kishimkan has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 30,000 KGS to buy cattle. She plans to use the received profit from selling the cattle in the fall to build a large shed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1266103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1266190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young milk giving cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-12-28T08:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-27T08:20:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shova ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340415889},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347171015},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-23T09:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913238},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-28T08:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364624215},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-29T09:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020215},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381808044},{"amount":24.6,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.4,"payment_id":390668107},{"amount":23.87,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.13,"payment_id":400621623},{"amount":24.28,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.72,"payment_id":410196507},{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.25,"payment_id":419959956},{"amount":48.58,"local_amount":4166.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4392.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.42,"payment_id":429613849}],"funded_date":"2012-12-28T08:49:23Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:34:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C Pettersen"}},{"id":512493,"name":"Jovito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jovito is from Sto.

","en":"Kunduz is 45 years old and she is married with one child at home.  She provides a service to the shepherds in the village - as a source of income for her family, she has been involved in agriculture and raising livestock for 25 years.  She started this business with 1,000 KGS and thanks to her hard work, Kunduz now has one dairy cow with a calf and five sheep and goats and her monthly income from her farm is 4,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of increasing her business, Kunduz turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 20,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep and goats.  She plans to reinvest the remainder of the loan into the development of her business by building up her head of

Several times, Makvala has requested loans from local financial institutions for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly income earned by Makvala, who is involved in the food trading business. She buys pies from the local bakery and sells them at the railway station for a profit. According to the government's estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category and they get monthly social assistance.\r\n\r\nMakvala requested a loan from Credo to start up her own business and sell clothing herself. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, for they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Makvala will purchase clothes for wholesale prices and resell them in her district for a profit.

Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1266303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Several times, she has requested loans from local financial institutions for her hair care business start-up but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salary earned by Nata\u2019s mother working at a puppet theatre. Nata\u2019s husband works abroad to help financially. \r\n\r\nNata requested a loan from Credo to start a beauty salon. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nNata will purchase equipment for her beauty salon and start a hair care business. She will work as a stylist, and according her estimations, the business will be profitable and will increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the same business. Her family will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living

Uno de sus t\u00edos m\u00e1s cercanos a ella la apoyo y motivo desde el principio para que pusiera su propio negocio. De esta manera ella logra conseguir ingresos para mantener a su familia.

She is a shop-keeper, owning a little grocery store in one of the city's poorest areas.  Here there are very few grocery stores.  Ana decided to open the store so she could be close to her children and because it gives her a daily income.  Customers are constantly coming in to buy food for those at home.  One of her closest uncles supports Ana and, right from the beginning, encouraged her to start her own business.  This way, she is able to bring in an income to look after the family. Ana needs financing to buy bulk grains, oil, cleaning products, oats, soups, tinned foods, toothpaste and toilet paper, among other things.  One of her future plans is to have a larger store where she can have a store that is better stocked with food products, where her customers will find everything they need for their

The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-start loans on  soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income levels. With this loan, Taliko will repair her store and renovate it properly so that it satisfies the needs of her clients. Taliko hopes her business will be profitable and that this will increase her income and provide her family with enough money to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living

He will buy products in East Georgia at wholesale prices and sell them at a good price in his district. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income for the family. Their living conditions will improve, and in the future, they will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1266426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

For this reason when she had a family, they decided to turn these activities into what supported their home.  Currently they grow various crops, such as corn, potatoes, and others,  in their own fields.  Because farming does not provide a consistent daily income she has also started to raise animals such as chickens, sheep, pigs and cows.  She takes them to graze early in the morning.

After two successive expansions, Pablo now farms around 1,000 cacao trees spread out over four acres of lowlands. His wife Victoriana and four live-in children are of major help at harvest time, as the family tends to work their own cacao instead of hiring outside help. Pablo\u2019s family members are multilingual and speak both their native Maya Mopan as well as English.\n\nFarming was something Pablo was born into and embraced out of the need to support his family. He is happy to be able to offer his children the option of a high school education, which in Belize is both optional and comes at a high cost. Two of Victoriana and Pablo\u2019s children are currently in school, and one has opted to follow in Pablo\u2019s footsteps and work the land for a living.  \n\nBesides cacao, Pablo grows the traditional crops of beans, rice and corn, but is also experimenting with multi-cropping by planting fruit trees among his cacao and timber trees that provide the necessary shade and nutrients for both.  \n\nAs most of the family\u2019s income comes from cacao, their wellbeing rests on continuous efforts to maintain and grow yields. Pablo is requesting this loan to set up an individual nursery of 500 seedlings that will be transplanted in six months\u2019 time to expand his farm. In order to increase yields and shorten the period before the new trees become productive, Pablo will use grafting. So-called side-grafting means implanting a bud into the trunk of more mature seedling, a technique that requires utmost precision and on average results in around 75 percent success rate.

She started her small grocery store business with her own capital 4 years ago, with the help of her husband at the time. Her husband later left her alone with the business, but she decided to keep the grocery store business going. Noting that the grocery store needed more capital, she decided to ask for small loans from financial institutions to increase her sales. In addition to her small grocery store, she has another job: she works as a teacher at a school, which generates extra income. \r\n\r\nShe asks for the financing to buy all of the general merchandise, such as rice, beans, sugar, oil, chicken, soda and dairy products. She estimates that this loan will help her to grow her inventory by buying products that she doesn't yet stock. As the Christmas season is approaching, when the demand for her products increase, her future plans are to expand her business by buying clothing and shoes. Her next goal is to carry Eskimo ice creams.\r\n   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1267336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy all of the general merchandise, such as rice, beans, sugar, oil, chicken, soda and dairy products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-12-29T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-28T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ileana Del Carmen \t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:55Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339569035},{"amount":56.49,"local_amount":56.49,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":56.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118653},{"amount":54.63,"local_amount":54.63,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:38:31Z","rounded_local_amount":54.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531274},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573220},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373165912},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971728},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837099},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860403},{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":55.52,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":55.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349111}],"funded_date":"2012-12-29T19:27:55Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:59:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tricia Perry","image":null}},{"id":512880,"name":"Daisy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daisy is one of the members of the M.H 3 group.

He owns many greenhouses.  Igor used his prior loan to purchase two small boilers to heat the greenhouses.  He needed to stoke them every night - meaning he had to watch them to make sure that they did not extinguish.  Despite this he increased his earnings significantly and would now like to improve the heating system.\r\n\r\nIgor is asking for a loan of 24,000 hryvnia to purchase a large, automatic boiler and hoses and pipes for the heating system.  The new boiler will maintain the right temperature and will only need to be stocked once per day.  Igor, having saved time, plans to build a new greenhouse for planting.

She has raised two children; her elder son lives outside the home and her younger son is in school.  Her children actively help their mother around the house.  Since 2002, Kasyipa has been successfully raising livestock and selling milk.  Starting with the sum of 2,000 som (KGS), she has been able to increase her household's monthly income to 6,000 som.  To further increase her head of livestock, Kasyipa has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy some additional animals to raise.  She plans on using her increased income to build a new barn to provide good living conditions for her animals, and to make repairs on her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1267869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cows and a foal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kalmak-Ashuu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-31T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-30T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":73.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kasyipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50365,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776980},{"amount":101.07,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5036.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.18,"payment_id":542440112},{"amount":462.48,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25182.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":68.77,"payment_id":595435800}],"funded_date":"2012-12-31T11:33:53Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:30:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":512918,"name":"Lake Side Women's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group is located in the outskirts of Kampala near the shores of Lake Victoria.

So she planned to help her sister financially and started a small tailoring shop with her one sewing machine. She took orders from her customers for stitching plastic bags and whenever she had time, she got involved in a cane craft. She makes mirror stands, tools, chairs etc. from cane. She says that the cane craft is more profitable than tailoring. Because of her limited financial condition, she is not able to develop her cane craft business. She earns 3,000 INR per month from this activity, which is not sufficient for her family. She plans to purchase the raw materials (cane, coloring, nails, etc.) and appoint two workers for her business.\n \nShe has requested a loan of 30,000 INR for purchasing raw materials (cane, coloring,

He is married and a father to a 1-year-old daughter.\r\n\r\nFor the past four years, Salah has been operating a mobile phones store, which is located in a distinguished place in the market and has many loyal customers and a good reputation among them. This makes his project a profitable one and the only source of income to the family, but in spite of being a successful project, it also needs more support to cover some costs.\r\n\r\nSalah is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a new collection of mobile phones and accessories. This will meet the customers\u2019 requests and increase the sales, which will improve Salah's income and enable him to create better living conditions for his family.\r\n\r\nSalah is photographed inside his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

He is married and a father to four sons. He is employed and gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover all of his family's needs.\r\n\r\nAhmad lives with his family in Rafah city in a small and modest house. He is looking to improve his family's living conditions by purchasing necessary home appliances.\r\n\r\nAhmad is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help him cover the cost of purchasing a new refrigerator for his house. This will offer Ahmad and his family one of the necessary home appliances that will create better conditions at home.\r\n\r\nThis is Ahmad in the photograph. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who dedicates all of his efforts toward getting ahead with his family.  Juan was not able to study for a college degree, because from the time he was very young he had to work to support his parents, as he came from a large and very humble family.  However, he really would have liked to have studied to become an automotive mechanic.  At times, his wife cooks a rich ceviche to pamper him, because this is his favorite dish.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, with a lot of effort and dedication, Juan works each day as a taxi driver, providing transportation service in his city.

He has been engaged in his rice cultivation for 18 years, earning about 21,200 KHR per day.  For him, the lack of working capital for supporting his business is the main challenge.

Ella se dedica al comercio junto a su abuela desde hace cinco a\u00f1os; su mam\u00e1 se caso con otra persona y se fue de la casa; por eso Diana se quedo con su abuela y su esposo. Ella junto a su esposo instalaron una tienda de productos b\u00e1sicos, a la cual tratan de surtirla cada d\u00eda, ya que desean brindar una buena atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes. Para comprar los productos para su tienda, debe viajar a la ciudad, para eso camina  a pie unos treinta minutos, luego aborda el autob\u00fas que la conduce a la ciudad y tarda cuarenta minutos para llegar y luego regresarse a su casa. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar un quintal de fr\u00edjol, un quintal de az\u00facar, un quintal de arroz, dos garrafas de aceite, tres cajas de jab\u00f3n, rinso, lej\u00eda y la otra parte para instalar la luz el\u00e9ctrica en su casa. Actualmente, Diana traslada luz de la casa de su abuela hacia la casa de ella; pero lo ideal es que ella lo tenga solo para ella, adem\u00e1s que comprara m\u00e1s productos, pues cada d\u00eda los clientes demandan m\u00e1s productos y mejor atenci\u00f3n a sus necesidades. Su objetivo es ahorrar, para comprarse un terreno y construir su casa, donde vive es de un familiar. Por otra parte desea que su negocio prospere para que sus vecinos no viajen a la ciudad en busca de productos; sino que los puedan adquirir en su tienda. Todo esfuerzo que realiza , es con la \u00fanica finalidad de brindar a su hijo alimentaci\u00f3n, salud, vestuario y educaci\u00f3n. \n\n","en":"\n\n\nDiana, 24, is married and has a four-month-old son.  She and her grandmother have been merchants for five years.  Her mother remarried and left home which is why Diana lives with her grandmother and her husband.  She and her husband set up a grocery store that they try to stock every day because they want to provide good customer service.  To buy products for their store, she must travel to the city and to do so she first walks for half an hour to catch a bus that takes her to the city; it takes 40 minutes to get there and then she has to make the return trip home.\n\nPart of the loan she\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy a quintal of beans, a quintal of sugar, a quintal of rice, two large jugs of oil, three boxes of soap, RInso [brand of detergent] and lye and the other part is to install electricity at home.  Diana currently transfers electricity from her grandmother\u2019s house to hers but the ideal thing is for her to have her own.  She will also buy more products because customers demand more things every day to better meet their needs.
