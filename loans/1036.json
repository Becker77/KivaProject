Even though things were difficult the first few years, a close relative helped him and he made good friends. One of them lent him a motorcycle so that he could join a cooperative, have a stable income and stay solvent.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to build his own

He has two young children and is married to Marlene.\r\n\r\nLittle by little they have managed to strengthen their farm, where they produce raw milk and sell to the industrial milk plant.  Milk production is intensive in the area.  They have a good dairy herd that the family manages, selling a large part of the production.  Their livestock is a high-quality breed.  They work on land their parents gave them.\r\n\r\nCurrently they need to buy a gate for the entrance to the house and farm.  In previous years he has been able to build walls on his property, and they're not protected.  This means the cows could leave or undesirable people could come in and steal something.  This is why he's requesting the loan to build a wall to protect his cows.\r\n\r\nThe photo shows Wilber and his wife on a normal work day.  With the help they'll be able to continue improving their family's living

His business is growing little by little since he works on each product with his hands one by one, polishing, embossing and embedding his products. Everything is made by hand and the market is growing slowly since this activity requires a lot of capital. \r\n\r\nHe received the previous loan for raw material, especially for silver and stones. He has to work with double the capital because nobody pays him up front. He allows for payments to be made every three months in the different jewelry stores in the city. For this reason he is requesting another loan for raw material. This will help him to have operational capital without being left without rotating funds that will allow him to grow and expand his market.

She has lived on her own for over a year, leaving her parents due to family problems. She doesn\u2019t have any children and lives with her closest relatives, her grandmother and nephews, who help her in the agricultural production as well as they can. Scarce rainfall during the past agricultural season has decreased the volume of groundwater for irrigating the area. Rilma has lost a great part of her carrot crops since the community has restricted the use of water to minimum usage and does not have the water needed to support production which has caused a decrease in economic earnings as sales have dropped. It is because of the former reasons mentioned, that her financial stability has suffered and as her crops have been affected directly and she needs to acquire materials and merchandize to maintain her agricultural production, help feed her family and the day laborers that she employs.

Now she is leading a loan group of three female members to apply for a loan in the amount of 3,800,000KHR in total.

She is married and is a mother of two daughters and one son, all of whom are her responsibility and currently in school. This hard-working woman, Sambo, earns a living for her family by farming rice on a five-hectare farm. Having been in this business for ten years, Sambo is able to earn around 14,000 KHR daily to cover her expenses and to save some portion for future needs. Sambo has been with VisionFund, Kiva\u2019s partner, for two loan cycles already, with which she succeeded in making the livelihood of her family so much better. \r\n\r\nNow, she is leading a group member who is with VisionFund for the first time to take out a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 KHR and 500,000 KHR respectively. With her loan portion, Sambo will buy fertilizer, pesticide, and rice-seed to apply to her farmland.

With the help of this loan, Prom expects that his pigs will be healthier and fatter so that he can earn greater profits from this pig-raising business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1250638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy pig feed and piglets to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:09:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:09:41Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Prom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1500000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197833}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T02:09:15Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:34:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joy Adams","image":1247614}},{"id":504792,"name":"Sokhom's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 32-year-old married woman, Sokhom is a villager living in a rural area of Dambae district located in Kampong Cham province in Cambodia.

She is married and a mother of a daughter and a son, all of whom are under her responsibility and in school. To support her family, Buncheak raises pigs while her husband complements the income by farming rice, growing beans, and working as a hairdresser. Together, they are able to earn approximately 40,000 KHR daily and save around 14,000 KHR after deducting the daily expenses. Buncheak is leading a group of two female members who both are fourth-time borrowers with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) to take out a loan in the amount of 1,400,000 KHR each. Buncheak will spend some portion of the loan to support her husband's business by buying fertilizer, pesticide, and bean seeds.

All of her dishes are served with juices, sodas or other drinks preferred by her customers. Jessica also uses the loans she receives from the Communal Bank to help her husband with his business. He sells fish and travels around the city offering his products to people.\r\n   \r\nShe is requesting another loan, because thanks to the profit she made from her previous loan she was able to buy certain items that her children needed for school. In addition, one of them became ill and she had to spend money on medicine, which is why she fell behind on her payments. However, with her work she was able to pay it off in time. She will use this loan to buy fish for her husband to sell and provisions for the dishes she prepares. She has been with the Communal Bank for four loan cycles and enjoys the assistance the loans have given her.  \r\n \r\nHer goals are to move forward in her business and provide her children with a good education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1250525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy provisions and fish.

In addition to this she also works making and selling fish meal.  She works every day at both businesses.  She heads to Manta to buy fish that\u2019s not used in tuna production and she takes it home to be processed into fish meal which she sells to merchants that export it abroad.  She\u2019s been in this activity for 8 years and has done well.\r\n\r\nShe is repeating her loan because thanks to profits from the previous one her husband was able to fix up a parcel of land they are going to plant on because winter is approaching.  For her, the loans are always very important because she always invests profits to improve her economic situation.  \r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy chicken feed and fish to make the fish meal.

She has been making enchiladas and plantain and yucca tostadas for more than 30 years.  The most popular items she sells are her famous chucho cakes.  They are stuffed with potatoes, green beans, and rice.   She sells these in a city market from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm. She also sells coffee and chocolate and learned all of this from her family who does the same thing.  Luscinda has provided an education for her children.

Now that she has her Kiva loan, she has been repaying it and is 50% completed.  She will also buy 300 tiles, 15 metal sheets, and 10 square cuts of lumber to replace the roof on her home that has been damaged and stands to be further damaged with the coming rains.  In this way she can increase her sales and income to have financial solvency, pay the household expenses, and help her nieces with their studies.\r\n\r\nLuscinda wants to build another house because she has two nieces who are in public school where they live and it\u2019s too far so she wants to give them shelter during rainy

Cuando se baja del bus en el desvi\u00f3, ya est\u00e1 su esposa esper\u00e1ndolo para trasladar el producto a su casa ya que no hay calle y lo hacen caminando por veredas y cargando el producto en sus espaldas.\n La elaboraci\u00f3n del pan la realiza por la tarde y tiene el apoyo de su esposa y un ayudante adicional. Para vender el pan lo hace de manera personal sin ning\u00fan medio de transporte, utilizando un canasto caminando a pie por toda la colonia  y logrando as\u00ed la venta del pan. Por ser un pan caliente y artesanal es preferido por sus vecinos y por esa raz\u00f3n tiene un mercado potencial. \nDon salvador nunca ha obtenido cr\u00e9ditos, toda la inversi\u00f3n la realizo cuando trabajo de forma dependiente, pero hoy necesita el cr\u00e9dito para poder fortalecer su unidad productiva y de esa forma ser mas competitivo y lograr crecer con la venta de pan en lugares vecinos sobretodo mejorando la salubridad del taller. \u00c9l ha utilizado muy bien el credito anterior ya que esta invirtiendo bastante en la elaboraci\u00f3n de pan y m\u00e1s aun en estas fechas navide\u00f1as, vende m\u00e1s. El anhelo  es que en un futuro pueda adquirir su propia casa ya que en este momento vive en casa de su suegro y siente  incomodidad por lo que sue\u00f1a con darle mejores condiciones a su esposa, su hijo actual y otros que Dios le regale.\n","en":"Salvador is 23 years old, married and has one son.  Two years ago he decided to start and establish his own bakery business (French bread).  Before starting this business, he was a baker\u2019s helper for eight years and then decided to go out on his own and satisfy a need in his neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan to prepare his shop and the gallery where he has the artesian oven.  It turns out that the floor is a dirt floor and the metal roof is damaged and allows water to leak in during the winter.  The dust created during the summer and puddles in the winter make it necessary to buy metal for the roof, sand, and cement to fix the dirt floor.  He will also buy molds so that he can increase his production of bread.\r\n\r\nSalvador travels to the Cabecera department to buy supplies three times a week.  On these days he gets up very early because he has to walk a full kilometer to get to the main street where he catches the bus for a two hour round trip.  When he gets off the bus, his wife is already waiting for him to take the products home.  There is no street, so they have to carry the things on their backs.\r\n\r\nHe bakes his bread in the evening and has his wife\u2019s support and help from an assistant.  He sells the bread personally with no transportation; he carries it in a basket and walks around the whole neighborhood.  People prefer it because it\u2019s hot and artesian, so he has a strong market.  \r\n\r\nSalvador had never had a loan before.  He invested the money he saved up when he was working for others, but he needed a loan to be able to strengthen his production unit, be more competitive, and be able to sell in neighboring areas.  Above all, he wants to improve his bakery.  He used the money from this loan to invest in bread baking and more so for the Christmas season, when his sales increase.  His desire is to have a house of his own in the future; he currently lives with his father in law and he is a little uncomfortable.  He also wants to provide better living conditions for his wife, his son, and any others that God gives him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":894451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to repair his rood and floor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:11:52Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:11:52Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":65.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":66.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":71.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":73.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":87.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.46},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.26,"local_amount":133.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":133.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517294},{"amount":70.81,"local_amount":70.81,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":70.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069123},{"amount":152.41,"local_amount":152.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525343},{"amount":75.6,"local_amount":75.6,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133583},{"amount":72.59,"local_amount":72.59,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":72.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390801646},{"amount":79.13,"local_amount":79.13,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":79.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814745},{"amount":167.03,"local_amount":167.03,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":167.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090589},{"amount":149.17,"local_amount":149.17,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":149.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856591}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T15:54:16Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T15:12:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She\u2019s been working for thirteen months selling underwear, a business she learned on her own.  Due to life\u2019s circumstances, all she could think of was a way to contribute to household expenses.  She used to work in a beauty salon that she set up thanks to the economic support she got from her father and with some savings she had but she had to close due to crime and she had to change her residence.  She sold all her equipment and supplies.  Today, she\u2019s starting out with a new business and only has a little merchandise and needs more to fill demand for Christmas and New Year\u2019s.\r\n\r\nTo buy merchandise, she has to walk six kilometers and cross two rivers that do not have bridges.  The zone she lives in is mountainous and coffee is grown there.  Because of this, she must leave home at 4:30am and walk for an hour and twenty minutes to get to the bus stop which then takes an hour and forty-five minutes to get to the city where she buys the merchandise.  She walks quite a bit because no buses come to the place where she lives because of the terrain, only 4x4 pick-up trucks can make it and she prefers to walk because she saves four dollars that she can invest in merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019s requesting is to buy blouses, skirts, men\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes and underwear for both genders.  In this way, she\u2019ll have merchandise available to sell.  Among her plans is to own a clothes store in town and to rest a bit more because she sells merchandise house to house all day long.  She also intends to save up to provide her daughter with an education and to build a house of her own since she lives with her parents and siblings.  Her father helps her out because she\u2019s a newly-wed and does not own any type of property.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1253324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes, underwear and footwear for adults and children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:15:49Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:15:49Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nidia Yamileth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":17.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":18.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":19.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":19.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":20.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":20.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":21.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":21.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":23.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":24.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.86,"local_amount":19.86,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":19.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517297},{"amount":18.45,"local_amount":18.45,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:58:48Z","rounded_local_amount":18.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069125},{"amount":41.76,"local_amount":41.76,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":41.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525346},{"amount":15.16,"local_amount":15.16,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":15.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390801647},{"amount":84.98,"local_amount":84.98,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090590},{"amount":35.31,"local_amount":35.31,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":35.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439715962},{"amount":34.48,"local_amount":34.48,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":34.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622325}],"funded_date":"2013-01-02T14:34:01Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":506388,"name":"Benjam\u00edn Obed","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Benjam\u00edn tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero.

Now San is leading a loan group with three female members to take out a loan in the amount of 3,700,000KHR in total. As a group leader, she will utilize her loan portion in this loan, which is 1,400,000KHR, to support her business as well as her husband\u2019s business by purchasing pig feed, fertilizer, pesticide, and bean seeds.

She is married and a mother of three dependent children, all of whom are school-aged children. Loek offers a decent life for her family by raising pigs while her husband complements the income by working as a rice farmer and a fisherman. Together, they are able to earn around 75,000KHR per day and manage to save approximately 14,000KHR after offsetting the daily cost of living. This will be Loek\u2019s seventh time requesting loan via Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. The previous loans have enabled her to better support her family and improve the family\u2019s living condition as well. Now, Loek is leading a loan group of five female members, who all have been with VisionFund before and successfully paid back their previous loans, to take out a loan in the amount of 6,800,000KHR in total.

This industrious woman expects a boost in her income so that she can use it to pursue her children\u2019s education and, hopefully, be able to save some money to build a warm house for her family in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1254562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Moung Russey district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:18:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:18:20Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sambo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800000},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":800000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942516},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1200000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429641666}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T15:38:50Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T23:54:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":506938,"name":"Roger","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roger, 49 years old, is from the mountainous region of Isabela.

This couple is able to earn 28,000KHR per day and saves approximately 18,000KHR after deducting their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nNy, a first-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), is leading a group member, who is a third-time borrower, to take out a loan in the amount of 1,800,000KHR in total. As group leader, Ny will use her loan portion, which is 1,000,000KHR, to purchase spare parts for her tractor. She would like to dedicate all of her hard work to moving her family ahead and hopefully send her only son to school in the future.

40-year-old mother of three children, two of whom are still dependent on her and still in school. The main sources of the family\u2019s income are from planting cassava and selling bananas by motor in a local area. She has been in this business for fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan for Phoern with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. The first loan has helped her relieve her family's burden and support her children\u2019s education. Now she is requesting for a loan of 1,500 USD to buy a new motorbike for her banana selling business and use a portion of it to spend on buying fertilizer for her farmland. She hopes to earn more income from her current business so as to improve her lifestyle and keep her children in school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1256379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to spend on buying fertilizer for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Ponhea Krek district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:22:31Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:22:31Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phoern","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355941577},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390696381},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429641687},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468064865},{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490979403}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T18:36:23Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T20:07:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}}]}
