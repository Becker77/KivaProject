To offer a decent life for the family, Touch and her husband work as rice farmers on a hectare of farmland. Touch\u2019s husband also has a business catching fish in order to supplement the income. This couple is able to earn around 14,000 KHR per day and save approximately 7,000 KHR after the daily expenses. This will be Touch\u2019s third time requesting a loan via VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The previous loans have enabled her to improve the family\u2019s living conditions.

She is trying hard to fulfil their demands including food, health, clothing and education. She has been stitching gloves for the past eight years. She has one sewing machine which has been purchased with the financial help of Kashf Foundation. Her husband is working on a power loom but his income is not sufficient to run the household alone so she is contentedly doing it for the sake of her family and contributes enough to the family income.

Como si esto fuera poco, sanidad le exigi\u00f3 que debe cambiar el lavaplatos y el ba\u00f1o de su residencia, por lo cual se encuentra solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para realizar los ajustes que le solicitaron, de lo contrario le cerrar\u00e1n su negocio.

Por estas razones ella no puede quedarse sin ingresos. ","en":"Ana Cecilia, 38, is a single mother of three minor children.  This woman is responsible for her children and her mother because her father died and her husband abandoned her.  When she became unemployed she needed to earn income to solve the economic need she was facing.  She decided to open a home-based grocery store that had very little stock merchandise because of the little capital she had available to invest in it.  And as if this weren\u2019t enough, the health department is requiring her to replace her kitchen sink and the bathroom at home which is why she\u2019s asking for a loan to do the adjustments they require because if she does not do them they will shut her business down.  Ana is very worried because her store is her only source of income and her children are in school and her mother needs medicine that she must provide and for all these reasons she cannot be left without income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1259841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to replace the kitchen sink and remodel the restroom in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Frontino","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T08:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T08:30:15Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":71346},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":73330},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75369},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77464},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79618},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81831},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84106},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":86445},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":88848},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91319},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":93857},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":96467}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.19,"local_amount":144676,"processed_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":149281.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548823},{"amount":0.05,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":81.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098694},{"amount":43.35,"local_amount":75389,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":77788.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517888},{"amount":91.12,"local_amount":158464,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":163508.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373513825},{"amount":47.39,"local_amount":82409,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":85032.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390981487},{"amount":48.75,"local_amount":84779,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":87477.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420094591},{"amount":25.37,"local_amount":44114,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":45518.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504283616},{"amount":235.78,"local_amount":410090,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:00:09Z","rounded_local_amount":423145.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579599476}],"funded_date":"2013-01-11T15:09:29Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:00:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":509801,"name":"Yadira Yamileth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Yadira es una persona responsable honesta y trabajadora, vive junto a su esposo y sus hijos en una comunidad de Choluteca, al sur de Honduras.\nDo\u00f1a Yadira su negocio es la venta de tortillas.

Phalla is 24 years of age and married. She also is the mother of a son and a daughter, both of whom are dependent on her and currently in school. To continually support the family, Phalla has been working tirelessly as a rice farmer, on a seven-hectare plot of farmland, for around ten years. Phalla\u2019s husband provides a service, repairing and washing motors, in order to complement the income. This couple is able to earn approximately 38,000 KHR daily. \r\n\r\nThis is Phalla\u2019s first time requesting a loan via VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She is seeking a 3,000,000 KHR loan to support her rice-growing business, by purchasing fertilizer and rice seed. She will also use this loan to buy spare parts for the motor-repairing business of her husband.

(carpet) sales in her community for many years. She buys various colors of mats in different sizes and then sells them in her vicinity and in the local market. At the time she has retained many customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income. Her husband is a government servant with low salary income. She is a mother of four children; one of her sons is not in a good health. That\u2019s why she started her business, to earn good profit to manage her household and the medical expenses of her son as well.\r\n\r\nTo cope with the increasing demand of her customers, Ms. Marium needs to purchase more mats in different colors and sizes by taking into account the choice of her customers.

When Tahira suggested the idea of a self-owned business to her husband, he rejected it by saying that she lacks the knowledge and ability to do anything independently. Adamant on proving him wrong, Tahira borrowed money from her brother and injected it into a newly-formed grocery store. Today she is famous in her community for running a store that provides perishables to many households. She has five children, and three are currently attending school. Her current business cash flows do not allow her to enroll her remaining two children in school. Tahira now wishes to increase the amount of inventory in her store by purchasing more packs of beverages, oil, and milk. She has requested a loan worth PKR 30,000.

He is married and has one child. His wife takes care of the house and raises their child. Umedjon himself has been a dekhan farmer for more than 7 years. He owns 4 hectares of land himself, where he grows onions and corn. In his spare time he carts hay privately. However, the money he earns from carting privately goes to the family's living costs. \r\n\r\nTo broaden his business and more precisely the growing of corn, Umedjon turned to Kiva. For the loan received, Umedjon would like to purchase seeds and fertilizers. He is very happy that an organization like Kiva exists, and that with the help of this kind of organization people in the low and middle class of the population can realize their plans.

The inhabitants\u2019 main activity is agriculture.  They still maintain their traditional clothing, culture, and traditions.  They are happy and very gentle people.\r\n\r\nVirginia is one of the members of the \u201cEntrada Chunazana\u201d communal bank and has been for five years.  She is 39 years old, is in a common law marriage, and has seven children.  One of her daughters is married and on her own.  Two of their children attend school and two others are too young and are still at home.  Her husband is an artist and works daily as a mason.  They live in a home of their own.\r\n\r\nVirginia raises pigs, Guinea pigs, and chickens and sells them in her own community.  She farms her land and harvests only for the family\u2019s consumption.  She also makes \u201cpolleras\u201d (a typical regional dress item)\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy fabric, thread, and feed for her animals.  Her dream is to have her own business, such as a restaurant because she enjoys food.
