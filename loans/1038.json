She has 3 cows and 1 buffalo to milk. When she first started working with livestock, she used to purchase goats and sheep and sell them at the festival of Eid-ul-Azha. Gradually Rasheedan purchased cows and buffaloes so she could move from livestock sales into milk production. She sells the milk to many of her neighbors, along with butter, cheese and ghee that she makes from the milk, and she is proud to maintain a good client list. Her business is good enough for her to lead a decent life.\r\n\r\nRasheedan is a mother of four: two daughter and two sons. Her husband also helps in her business.

She makes her main purchases in fabric stores in the city of Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHer business idea started in January 2007, when she was looking for a formal job and decided on her own to request the service of making shirts and pants for men and blouses for women, which she orders from satellite workshops that offer the service as an assembly system.  (That is, she invests in the raw materials and supplies, and small workshops do the design, cutting, making, assembling, and finishing of the pieces, and ultimately she sells on order.)\r\n\r\nIn the past Liliana traveled to Spain with financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to participate in a learning and technology mission.

She buys her items at the Colomi marketplace every Thursday from farmers to sell at the Ivirgarzama tropic where she has a stall; she has been in business for over 6 years. Mrs. Emiliana needs capital to buy and sell potatoes, as her savings were used to buy a lot of land to build a home. Mrs. Emiliana says that she has small capital for her business and the loan will help her buy more potatoes to sell.

Then she took an idea from her neighbors and started breeding cattle, to sell them at the festival of Eid-ul-Azha, etc. With the profit and Kashf Foundation loan, she purchased more cows to increase the business of selling milk. \r\n\r\nShe sells milk to many of her neighbors, along with butter, cheese, and dasi ghee that she makes from the milk. She has a good client list. Her business is good enough to help her lead a decent life.\r\n\r\nRasoolan has five children. Her sons also help in her business. \r\n\r\nRasoolan is in her sixth loan cycle and she has a strong association with Kashf Foundation. She has taken several loans and each time she has shown excellent behavior. \r\n\r\nNow, Rasoolan requests a loan of PKR 50000 to buy one more cow, to increase the production capacity of milk. In this way, she would be able to serve more people in her community. Rasoolan desires to provide quality education to her children for their bright future.

Desde muy joven  hizo sus primeros emprendimientos y hace 13 a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 su tarea comercial, con el que ha logrado poco a poco hacerla crecer, incrementando el surtido y generando cada vez m\u00e1s clientes. Los art\u00edculos que vende son principalmente ropa, calzado, cosm\u00e9ticos  y perfumer\u00eda en general.  As\u00ed mismo ha aprovechado su clientela criolla, para ofrecerles el servicio de llamadas a celulares por minutos, con el que genera un ingreso m\u00e1s. Sus ventas las realiza de contado y muchas veces a cr\u00e9dito y trabaja 10 horas diarias; ella compra a proveedores, que son empresas multinacionales que le ofrecen art\u00edculos mediante revistas especializadas o cat\u00e1logos y con ellos promociona sus ventas. Su meta mas adelante es tener una casa propia y para eso su mayor desaf\u00edo es aumentar su capital de trabajo. Se acerca la temporada de navidad y de a\u00f1o nuevo, \u00e9poca en la cual sus ventas se incrementan y el dinero que recoge producto de sus cuentas por cobrar, no es suficiente, esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 ropa elegante, calzado, accesorios femeninos, con lo que sus clientes lucir\u00e1n en las fiestas familiares mas lindas del a\u00f1o.

As a born merchant, she develops skills with mastery and intelligence and is always ready to look for honest business opportunities. This brings a benefit to support her 11-year-old daughter, whom she dedicates all of her work efforts and attention toward in order to make her happy and improve her well-being. \r\n\r\nFrom a very young age she did her first entrepreneurial venture and 13 years ago she began her commercial work, with that she has managed little by little to make it grow. She has increased the assortment and each time generated more clients. \r\n\r\nThe items that she sells are primarily clothing, shoes, cosmetics, and general perfumes. Likewise she has taken advantage of her Creole clientele and offered them a service of cellular phone calls by the minute. With that she generates even more revenue. She realizes her sales in cash and lots of times by credit. She works ten hours a day. \r\n\r\nShe buys from suppliers, which are multinational companies that offer her items by means of specialized magazines or catalogs and with them she promotes her sales service. \r\n\r\nHer future goal is to have her own home and for this reason her major challenge is to increase her capital from her work. The season approaches of Christmas and New Year, a time in which her sales increase and the money that she gathers from the product of her accounts is not sufficient. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason she is asking for a Kiva Loan. With the loan she will purchase elegant clothing, shoes, feminine accessories that her clients will wear in the nicest family parties of the year. Since she knows the market and applies the loan in the highest peaks of her sales period, her Kiva loan will be successful. \r\n

This was to sell supplies, food and other household goods in small amounts so that her customers could buy items every day.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, her business grew, and she eagerly went to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to request a loan. After this, it grew even further. Today, she has received two loans which have increased her working capital, and through persistence and discipline she has managed to make improvements to her home and give her children an education. She has used her funding to increase the range of products she offers to her customers, in turn earning a larger profit. \r\n\r\nToday, her profit never falls below 22% and she rotates her stock every two days. Because of her dream of prosperity for this business entity, she is requesting a loan from Kiva to buy rice, oil, coffee and sugar in larger quantities, in order to get discounts. In addition, these are her best-selling products, and since it is the end-of-year period, when they are consumed in greater quantities due to Christmas and New Year, her investment will be very successful. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1267011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

These hard working Meitei women belong to a non-tribal community. They come together to support one another and live in a small village on the outskirts of Imphal East in Manipur state, which is in the Northeastern part of India.\r\n \r\nPremeshori is the profiled member pictured with her hand raised. She is 30 years old and is a mother to three daughters and two sons. Her husband is a hired carpenter by profession. The three older children go to a private school nearby. In order to supplement the family income before the loan, she earned an income by weaving Manipuri traditional clothes for others. She was paid for weaving only.\r\n \r\nWith her first loan in 2010, she continued her weaving activities by buying yarn with the loan. She managed to earn just enough profit to repay her loan liability. With competition in the market, she could not keep up with the challenges. With her second loan, the group members decided and agreed upon joint and common activities for profit motives. The group decided upon sand sieving (Quarrying) from the riverbed. They invested the loan of INR 80,000 to buy a permit for a portion of the riverbed to extract sand use for construction. The remaining INR 20,000 was shared equally among the members for their personal use. All the members work together at their owned site. The sale proceeds were shared equally by all the members. Sometimes the group was able to share the profit daily or on alternate days, depending on the business. From this share of profit, Premeshori bought two piglets to raise for her own. Furthermore, she invested INR 100 daily towards the group saving and another INR 500 on monthly savings managed by local investors. In this way, she means to do well for the family and supplement the family income.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too undertook different activities to supplement their income apart from the joint activity of sand sieving business. Small it may be, but with the profit, some members started poultry farming, raising ducks, running a paan corner, buying yarns for others to weave and so on.\r\n\r\nNow the group needs another loan to continue with their sand sieving business. The loan will be use to buy another permit for a portion of the river bed to extract sand to sell.   \r\n    \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1267989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Quarrying","sector":"Construction","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy another permit for a portion of the riverbed to extract sand to sell.   \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T09:16:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T09:16:22Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Premeshori","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khomdon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kamala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibecha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-02T19:04:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":512967,"name":"Bahrom","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0411\u0430\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0428\u0430\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430. \u0415\u043c\u0443 21 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u041e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0416\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446 \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u043e\u043c. \u0411\u0430\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \n\u0411\u0430\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0445\u0447\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u0411\u0430\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c. \n\u0411\u0430\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0439.

She is 31 years old and is a mother to two sons and a daughter. She lives with her children and husband who is a carpenter by profession but usually earns income for the family on a seasonal basis. All the children attended a private school nearby. Before taking a loan, she did weaving activities part-time. At the same time, she did sand sieving activities from time to time. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, with her first loan, she opened a small shop to earn income. She sells paan, cigarettes, soap, toy guns and eatables. With the second loan the following year, she expanded her shop by bringing in more new items to sell. With the help of her husband, she also started to sell fresh vegetables and included more grocery items such as oil, spices locally found, grain, potatoes, sugar, milk powder, chili, dry fish, dal etc. With the profit, she managed to repay her loan liability. She contributed INR 100 to the group savings on a monthly basis. Moreover, in order to save more, she joined a group of investors managed locally and invested INR 500 monthly. With the delay in loan disbursement by WSDS for the third phase, she used these savings to continue her business. She and her husband plan to re-establish her husband's carpentry business. She has been working very hard to sustain the family and providing education to her children is her only goal.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to continue with her supplementary income activities. She will use the loan to increase her stock to sell at her store to earn profits. She also wishes to use part of her loan to help her husband to start his carpentry activities. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too needed another loan to improve their respective income-generating activities. Tea hotel business, retailing traditional weaved products, and sand sieving are the activities the group members are engaged in.    \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1267968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more store stock ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-01T09:16:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-31T09:16:22Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purnimashi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilashini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tembi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-02T20:56:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":512954,"name":"Diana Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These 12 hard-working women belong to a Tribal community. In 2010 they formed a group and called themselves the \u201cDiana Group\u201d. They all live in a small remote town called Saikul which is in the state of Manipur in the North Eastern part of India. It is about 70 km in distance from the main capital, Imphal.\r\n\r\nThemneo, one of the 12 members, is pictured with raised hand. She is 28 years old and is a mother to two sons and one daughter. All her children go to a private school in the town. Her husband is a cultivator by profession and the breadearner of the family. She helped her husband cultivating rice on leased land. That could never sustain them from buying rice while waiting for the next harvest, because the share of the harvest is one-third of the produce, which is  to say that the owner of the paddy field gets double the share of the cultivator. In order to supplement the family income, Themneo decided to start weaving, the only activity she is good at. In fact, she started weaving at the early age of 16.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she bought yarns and started her weaving activities. She wove traditional shawls called \u201cSaipikhup\u201d and wrap-round skirts called \u201cKhamtang\u201d and it takes about 6 days to finish  each respectively.  During the cultivation seasons she would schedule her time: three days for weaving and helping her husband in the field for two days. She actually made more progress with her business than she had imagined. Without much effort she was able to repay her loan and save money for household maintenance. Now, in order to expand her weaving activities, she apprentices her weaving skill by employing two learners. She has plans to create her own designs and start a weaving school in the long run.\r\n\r\nThemneo has short-term and long-term goals to mention. In order to do her weaving full time she aims to enroll her children in a boarding school so that it will be a win-win situation for her children as well as her business. Her long-term goal is to purchase a paddy field big enough to sustain them for the whole year round.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to expand her weaving activities.

She also takes care of one other child - a nephew whose parents passed away.\r\n\r\nTeo sells fresh fruits and vegetables, which include tomatoes, beans, Irish potatoes, onions, oranges, cabbages, etc. She supplements her business by selling fish and she works for seven days a week.\r\n\r\nAfter trying out several activities, Teo finally concentrated on the fresh fruit selling business, which seemed more profitable. That was in 2001. She diversified this business with fish selling. She will use the loan to boast up her fish selling business.\r\n\r\nThe major challenge she faces is the rotting of the fruits and vegetables. This comes from the period where there is low customer turn-over and the fact that she has no refrigerator to keep the fruits and vegetables fresh.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the loan, Teo hopes to buy a plot and build a house of her own in the near future.

They live in a small village at the outskirts of Imphal East in the state of Manipur which is in the North Eastern part of India. In order to supplement their family incomes, they came together as a group to help one another to access loans.\r\n\r\nPasot is the profiled member and is pictured with raised hand. She is 36 years old, a mother to three children, and lives with her husband, who is a workshop mechanic for two-wheeler vehicles. All her children go to a private school at the nearby town. She is very happy and determined to provide a good learning platform for her children. Before her loan she was a mere housewife. She just had to be content with the income that her husband brought home. With much persuasion, she talked her husband into letting her join a 5-member group to access loans.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she partnered with one weaver for profit-sharing. She bought yarns for the weaver to weave. Then she would sell the woven traditional clothes at the main market. With her second loan she continued with the trade on a wider scale by purchasing finished products to increase her supply at the main market. With part of her loan she opened a small tea stall which was open in the morning till 9:00 am and in the afternoon from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm, for her convenience. In her tea stall she serves only tea and 'puri'. As it turns out, she has been making better progress with her tea stall business than her other business. Eventually she began opening her tea stall for longer periods and it became her main source of income as well as for the family because her husband began helping at the tea stall.

As such, he is a farmer and he has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last ten years. He chose this business because it is profitable and fresh crops are in high demand. People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy.  In fact, many national dishes are made of vegetables such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruit is served at every meal in Azerbaijan and also makes fresh punch.\r\n\r\nAga sells his crop in the Bilasuvar Central Bazaar. His monthly income is 130 AZN. His wife actively helps him to raise the crop.\r\n\r\nAs these products are in high demand, Aga wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover market demand. For this purpose he has applied for a loan of 1000 AZN. He will buy new garden tools, seeds and fertilizers.
