They have empowered her to improve her business. She makes a profit when she sells, and she uses the profit to buy more goods to increase her income.

a living. She has been engaged in this business for the past 11 years. She started in her business first by selling for her mother, who later give her the initial capital to start her own venture. She is proud of her business because she is able to contribute toward supporting her family's needs.\r\n\r\nTetee has three children between the ages of two and six years old. The family lives in Buchanan, a town that is noted for fishing. The children live at home under her care and attend school. Tetee herself had to stop her education in the sixth grade. \r\n\r\nShe sells her products 10 hours a day, and she tends to make consistent profits because she sells quality blouses and cosmetics. \r\n \r\nShe is requesting a loan in order to purchase more blouses and cosmetics to offer for sale through her business. Her dream for the future is to buy land and build a decent house for the family.\r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva lenders for empowering her in her business.

He\u2019s been doing this for many years and has lots of experience which allows him to have good quality harvests.  The land he farms on is fertile and good for crops.  It\u2019s near his home and he sells everything in the surrounding zones, where he has many customers who prefer to buy from him because he always has what they need, at good prices, and with unequalled service.\r\n\r\nSamuel is a man dedicated to his work; always prepared to succeed.  He knows that he will be as successful as he wants to be through his hard work.  He had many losses during his previous harvest and wants to recover and invest, so he is asking INTEGRAL for a loan to buy jocote, corn, and sorghum seeds, fertilizer, and tools.

Wilbroda is a new One Acre Fund farmer and is excited for the 2013 Long Rains season. She joined the One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seeds and fertilizers, access the best input prices and once assured of reliable input delivery, to grow enough food for her family and to use increased profits to send her children to school.\n\nWilbroda described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one as a One Acre Fund farmer. She plans to spend the money that she earns from her next harvest on sending her children to school, repairing her home, buying livestock and perhaps investing in another business. Wilfrida\u2019s group members will each receive input loans of \u00bd acre during the 2013 Long Rains season.

The loan will be used to buy materials for mending clothes and will help Mwamini  to generate greater profits and boost the business. Mwamini  hopes that in the future she will be able to add more money to the business. \r\n\r\nMwamini  is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Elizabeth is 17 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fortportal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Elizabeth has been working hard to manage her small business selling raw food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Elizabeth has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva Field Partner, BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more raw food such as cassava and sweet potatoes for resale, and will help Elizabeth to generate greater profits and pay for her child's medical bills. Elizabeth hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past 2 years, Veronica has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells raw food such as Irish potatoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Veronica has requested a loan of 500000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase her inventory and buy more raw food for the business and will help Veronica to generate greater profits and start another business. Veronica hopes that in the future she will be able to extend the business. \r\n\r\nVeronica is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

The loan will be used to purchase more soft drinks, such as lemonade and passion fruit juice, to sell, and this will help Elizabeth to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Elizabeth hopes that she will be able to build a house of her own in the future. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past 6 years, Catherine has been working hard to manage her farm, growing tomatoes and sweet potatoes.\n\nTo help expand her business, Catherine has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase a generator that will help her set up another video cinema and help Catherine to raise more profits to add to the business. Catherine  hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house.\n\nCatherine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills training.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1249439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Entertainment","sector":"Entertainment","themes":["Vulnerable

She has worked all of her life in different fields that have allowed her to acquire experience to set up her own business.\r\n\r\nThanks to the savings that she managed to accumulate working as a domestic employee, she was able to put her idea about her business to work.  She started selling food in an itinerant manner on the streets of her municipality.  Later, she set up her business at a small rented place.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to be able to improve her quality of life and to buy a place that will allow her to reduce her fixed costs.  She dreams of being able to offer her grandchildren better educational opportunities.

For 12 years, he has worked selling sweets outside of the schools in his city. \"Even though this work isn't making me a millionaire, at least it staves off hunger in my home.\" With these words, Gregorio declares that his work has been a blessing, because it has allowed him to educate his children and bring home food every day. His biggest dream is to be able to launch a well-stocked store in order to increase his income and buy his family the house that they long for. He knows that the only way to achieve this dream is to work hard. This is why he doesn't brood over when to get up and start his work.

Two of her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nSeray began her business because her husband, an agriculturist, was not able to bring in enough of an income to support the home. Her business allows her to help support the family. She works at her business 10 hours per day, six days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is transportation.\r\n\r\nSeray is requesting a loan in order to buy general stock like soap, assorted drinks, and pure water. She is confident that the extra income from this loan will allow her to better support her family. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Seray plans to expand her business to a higher level. \r\n\r\nShe thanks you

Ten years ago, she separated from her husband and had to provide for her family alone. \"It has not been easy, but my children fill me with the motivation to fight every day and to be able to offer them the best.\" With these words, Emilse tells us about the life she has lived since she has no financial support from her spouse.\r\n\r\nDespite the difficult times she has been through, she managed to overcome her situation by drawing on her innate potential for hairdressing and everything related to the field of beauty. Her mother lent her the money to start her business in order to generate income and maintain her home. \r\n\r\nToday, her hair salon has allowed her to improve her quality of life and provide her children with food, clothing, and an education. Although she acknowledges that her life has improved considerably, she hopes to become a great entrepreneur.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She works selling rice at the central market in the city of Uzgen. She is the mother of 5 children. Her goal in life is to improve her standard of living, to give her children a good university education, and to of course expand her business. She is very kind, sociable, smart, and energetic. She started her business 13 years ago with a start-up sum of only 2,500 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Besides working in retail, she is also actively involved in animal husbandry. Her farm currently includes 4 head of cattle. For the purpose of expanding her business, Saparkul has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som which will help her to increase her turnover by buying more rice. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to re-invest into her business for further development.

Today, her farm brings in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy products and the resale of cattle.  Today, the farm has two cows. In order to further increase her livestock, Burobiya contacted Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves and sheep.

Hafez lives with his wife in a small village and he has a good reputation amongst his relatives and friends. Hafez is an ambitious young man and he prepares to start his own business which is a mobile phone store. \r\n\r\nHafez has an amount of money which is not enough to cover all the costs. He is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from Palestine for Credit & Development (FATEN) to cover the cost of purchasing the necessary number of mobile phones to open his store and meet the demand of his customers. Taking this loan will enable Hafez to successfully start his business and ensure better income and a bright future. Hafez is photographed inside his modest store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

works for Elephant Energy. Elephant Energy is a Namibian Trust that employs a market-based approach to spreading access to affordable energy technologies in rural areas throughout Namibia. These are technologies that improve the quality of life for people living without electricity, who are forced to rely upon costly, inefficient, and health-hazardous energy sources such as candles, kerosene, and single-use batteries.  Because of the barriers imposed by Namibia\u2019s vast distances and limited transportation network, Elephant Energy\u2019s strategy focuses on a highly decentralized network of village-based energy entrepreneurs who bring both education and products to their communities.\r\n\r\nGottlieb lives in Oshakati, Namibia with his wife and children. He has been an actor in rural development over the past 16 years and is driven by his passion for delivering renewable energy solutions to Namibia\u2019s rural areas. Amazingly, he has worked in rural areas in all 107 constituencies in Namibia, which has brought him a keen understanding of the realities faced by the many thousands of Namibians who live off the electric grid. Gottlieb understands both the social and technical sides of solar energy, is skilled in installing, maintaining and repairing solar home systems, and has a keen awareness of what drives and motivates the adoption of new energy practices by rural families. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase the inventory needed to expand Elephant Energy\u2019s rural entrepreneur model to six new regions of Namibia that are home to the majority of Namibia\u2019s unelectrified population. This is part of Elephant Energy\u2019s strategy to provide improved energy alternatives to 10,000 homes (or 50,000 individuals) in the year 2013.\r\n\r\nBarefoot Power is a valued partner because they provide products that are in high demand by Namibia\u2019s off-grid populations. The products are sturdy and rugged enough to withstand Namibia\u2019s harsh desert environments, affordable enough for even the poorest customers to afford, and their focus on integrating cell-phone charging functions provides a huge value-add to these products at a time when the number of rural Namibians with cell phones is rising at a rapid rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7150,"image":{"id":1270161,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2826,"youtubeId":"HdmJ5InSKg4","title":"Kiva Borrower Gottlieb from Namibia","thumbnailImageId":1270161},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy and sell Barefoot Power's solar lighting products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NA","country":"Namibia","town":"Windhoek","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-22 17","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T00:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T00:10:01Z","loan_amount":7150,"lender_count":234,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gottlieb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":7150,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":7150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2145},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5005}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2145},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5005}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7150,"local_amount":7150,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419778968}],"funded_date":"2013-01-03T15:10:46Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":513396,"name":"Flor Celina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor, tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposo tiene una hija de 5 a\u00f1os, ella trabaja la alfarer\u00eda y su esposo es agricultor, su horario de trabajo es de 8:00am hasta las 4:00pm, se traslada a vender la mercader\u00eda al mercado.

todas son mujeres, personas muy trabajadoras. El grupo se re\u00fane en una colina en donde lo mejor que se puede apreciar es le sol por las tardes. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron las integrantes del grupo y lo eligieron ya que donde viven hay una capilla que tambi\u00e9n se llama El Calvario es donde se celebra la crucifixi\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas en Semana Santa.\n\nDo\u00f1a Elena quien forma parte del grupo \"El Calvario\" platica que tiene 33 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or V\u00edctor desde hace 9 a\u00f1os juntos han formado una familia con tres ni\u00f1os que se encuentran estudiando, Do\u00f1a Elena se dedica a realizar paletas de hielo y helados desde hace 8 a\u00f1os Do\u00f1a Elena las realiza para despu\u00e9s venderlas, comenta que inicio con su actividad porque antes de que se casaran Don V\u00edctor ya se dedicaba a la venta de sus paletas y helados, las paletas y helados son preparados desde dos d\u00edas antes ya que para la elaboraci\u00f3n es todo un proceso como moler la fruta, poner en moldes para despu\u00e9s ponerlos a congelar y finalmente embolsarlos,  preparar el helado, cuando ya tienen sus helados preparados y paletas colocan todo en su carrito y salen a ofrecer al mercado o en la comunidad donde viven sus helados, Do\u00f1a Elena comenta \"Me gusta mucho salir a vender mis helados y paletas y escuchar a las personas decir que les gusta mis productos esa es la mejor satisfacci\u00f3n que obtengo de mis clientes\" Do\u00f1a Elena est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito a la instituci\u00f3n para comprar m\u00e1s material para la realizaci\u00f3n de sus paletas y helados como palos, colorantes, fruta, leche y leche.\nLa dificultad que presenta Do\u00f1a Elena es en la \u00e9poca de frio porque nadie comprar sus productos las personas lo menos que consumen son las cosas fr\u00edas como las paletas y helados, Aunque esto no la detiene a tener sue\u00f1os de llegar alg\u00fan d\u00eda a tener una never\u00eda mas grande esto le ayudara para que sus hijas tengan alg\u00fan d\u00eda una carrera profesional y puedan tener una mejor calidad de vida. Los integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy contentos por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado ya que podr\u00e1n invertirle en sus negocio como Do\u00f1a Felicitas, Elia y Enriqueta en una peque\u00f1a tienda de abarrotes, Cristal herramientas para construcci\u00f3n, Petra, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Luisa y Margarita en borregos y Do\u00f1a Alberta en ropa.\n","en":"The group \"El Calvario\" (The Calvary) consists of 10 members, all of them women, very hard-working people. The group meets on a hill where the best thing to appreciate is the afternoon sun. The members chose the name of the group, and they chose it because in the area where they live there is a chapel which is also called The Calvary, and it is where they observe the crucifixion of Jesus during Holy Week.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Elena, who is part of the El Calvario group, relates that she is 33 years old. She has been married to Se\u00f1or Victor for 9 years. Together they have formed a family with three children, who are in school. Do\u00f1a Elena's work for eight years has been making popsicles and ice cream. She makes them to sell, and she comments that she began her business because before they were married Don Victor was already selling popsicles and ice cream. The popsicles and ice creams are made two days ahead of time, since the preparation involves a process of grinding the fruit, putting it into molds to then set it to freeze, and finally putting it in bags. When they have the ice creams and popsicles ready, they gather them in their cart and go out to offer them in the market or in the community where they live. Do\u00f1a Elena comments, \"I very much like to go out to sell my ice creams and popsicles and hear the people say that they like my products. It is the greatest satisfaction that I obtain from my customers.\" Do\u00f1a Elena is applying to the institution for the loan to buy more materials to make her popsicles and ice creams, such as sticks, coloring, fruit, and milk.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty that Do\u00f1a Elena faces is in the cold season, because nobody buys her products, since the last things people want to eat are cold things like popsicles and ice cream. However, this does not stop her from having a dream of someday having a bigger freezer. This will help her so that her daughters can some day have a professional career and have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are very happy with the credit offered, since they will be able to invest in their businesses, such as Do\u00f1a Felicitas, Elia, and Enriqueta in a little grocery store; Cristal in construction tools; Petra, Maria Guadalupe, Luisa, and Margarita in sheep; and Do\u00f1a Alberta in clothes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6750,"image":{"id":1262075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" to buy plastic bags, fruit, milk, food coloring, etc., to make popsicles and ice cream.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Calvario, San Felipe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T03:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":6750,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristal ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enriqueta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elia Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":86000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":10750},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2531.25,"local_amount":32250,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":32348.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284941},{"amount":1687.5,"local_amount":21500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":21565.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199228},{"amount":1687.5,"local_amount":21500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":21565.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596023},{"amount":843.75,"local_amount":10750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10782.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663447}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T03:34:19Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":513482,"name":"Annabelle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annabelle is a hard-working entrepreneur who has a shell crafts business and Avon dealership business in the Philippines.

She has worked for more than 10 years in clothing production.\r\n\r\nNow she is putting together her business project with the help of a neighbor and an aunt, who work daily from 8 in the morning until 7 in the evening doing third-party clothing construction.\r\n\r\nHer great dream is to be able to have her own line of women's clothing with a recognized trademark. To achieve this, she needs an holemaking machine and to buy fabrics and threads that will allow her to make quality clothing items. Even though she has plenty of motivation, she doesn't have the money for this investment, and for this reason she is applying for a

construir con el apoyo de su conviviente tras muchos a\u00f1os de trabajo.\nEl negocio que Carmen realiza consiste principalmente en la venta de prendas de vestir usadas, cumple esta labor en las zonas aleda\u00f1as a los r\u00edos hasta donde viaja de manera frecuente v\u00eda fluvial, los pobladores de dichos caser\u00edos le solicitan diversas prendas, ellas consigue la ropa en distintos

Trabaja sola pero viaja en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su conviviente ya que el se dedica a la pesca y aprovecha en vender todo lo que tiene mientras \u00e9l realiza su faena pesquera. Cuando se encuentra en la ciudad se dedica a la venta de golosinas como galletas, caramelos y otros.\nLe gustan ambas actividades que realiza ya que la mantiene ocupada y se decidi\u00f3 por ellas por la necesidad de tener un oficio para contar con un ingreso econ\u00f3mico para solventar los gastos de su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Lo que no le agrada, seg\u00fan comenta, es que algunas veces no ha logrado pescar lo suficiente para cubrir los gastos de la pesca, muchas veces debido a la escasez de los peces o a la creciente de los r\u00edos, pero eso no la desanima y contin\u00faa hacia delante es por eso que tiene planes de seguir con su negocio.\nEste es el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 3 con MFP, por tanto agradece a quienes hacen posible su cr\u00e9dito para continuar con sus objetivos, por otro lado est\u00e1 muy comprometida una vez m\u00e1s a cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas como lo hizo en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo, est\u00e1 muy contenta de pertenecer a su banco comunal ya que todos sus integrantes son muy buenos, amables y solidarios.\nCon el monto solicitado (S\/. 1800), comprar\u00e1 diversos fardos conformados por prendas de vestir, de esta manera espera seguir trabajando.\n\n","en":"Carmen is 57 years old and is a happy, friendly woman with lots of business experience.  She lives with 55 year old Dennis who is a fisherman, with her parents, and children, ages 20 and 17 in a home that she built with help from her husband and many years of work.\r\n\r\nCarmen sells used clothing in the nearby zones around Los Rios, where she travels frequently by river.  People from these areas request various types of clothing from her.  She buys the clothing in different shopping areas in the city and then sells them in each place she visits.  She\u2019s been doing this for three years.  [Carmen] works alone but travels with her husband, since he is a fisherman; she takes advantage of the time to make her sales while he accomplishes his fishing tasks.  When she is back in town she sells snacks such as cookies, candy, and other things.\r\n\r\nShe likes both businesses because they keep her busy and she started them out of need for having a trade to count on for an income to help pay the household expenses and her children\u2019s education.  What she doesn\u2019t like, she says, is that sometimes there is not enough fish to cover the cost of fishing.  Many times it\u2019s because of the scarcity of fish or the growth of Los Rios, but this does not discourage her and she continues forward.

Mahbuba is 51 years old, married, and raising 2 children. She has been working as a high school teacher for over 30 years and loves her job. The local populace respects Mahbuba as an educated and hard-working woman as well as a highly qualified educator. However, for a number of years, Mahbuba has been unable to improve her living conditions due to her and her husband's small salaries, which do not allow them to buy all necessities of life.\r\n\r\nMahbuba would like to start her own business in order to generate additional income. To this end, she took the course \"Succeed\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained her graduation certificate. Now she is quite ready to set up her own business and become successful. Mahbuba would like to start making traditional \"kurpacha\" mattresses as she has experience in this craft. Kurpacha is a mattress used by Tajiks both in bedrooms and in living rooms, and so it is always in high demand. Mahbuba will sew kurpachas and sell them at the local market. She plans to use her additional income to improve her living conditions. She is requesting a loan of 6000 somoni to purchase fabrics for her new business. Mahbuba is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1269499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

She is a very hard-working and kind woman. Matluba sews beautiful traditional women's dresses. While she has her own sewing machine, she never engaged in entrepreneurial activity and had no knowledge or skills in this area. However, the world's rapid development has made her take the decision to start her own business. To this end, Matluba took the course \"Succeed\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and received her graduation certificate. Now she is quite ready to launch her own business and succeed in this endeavour.\r\n\r\nMatluba would like to focus her business on sewing and selling women's clothing. She will purchase fabrics, create dresses, and sell them at the local market. Matluba will run her business on her own as her parents are unable to help her. She plans to use her income to improve her living conditions and to accumulate some savings. She is requesting a loan of 4000 somoni to purchase fabrics for her new business. Matluba is counting on your

49 years old, married, and raising 1 child. Thanks to her parents, Gulnora received university education, and for many years has been working as a teacher at her local high school. However, her salary is very low, and her husband is also unable to provide for their family on his own. In order to secure an additional source of income, Gulnora has decided to start her own business. She learned from her colleagues about the course \"Succeed\", organized by the Association of Business Women, where women are taught to set up their own businesses and earn a profit. With great enthusiasm, Gulnora took the course and received her graduation certificate. She learned good business skills and is now certain that her plan can be brought to life.\r\n\r\nGulnora would like to start her own business of buying and selling dried fruits. She is planning to do her trade at the nearest local market. Gulnora is requesting a loan of 5000 somoni to purchase dried fruits for her new business.

Pork\u2019s loan group is made up of two members who have taken out one previous loan from VisionFund. This previous loan helped Pork improve her family's living conditions.

She is married with two children, 6 years and 10 years old. Her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, Hannah established her retail business. Her husband is a teacher, but his income is not enough to take care of the home. Hannah began her business because she wants to create income to support the family. She works at the business ten hours per day and six days per week. She says her business is doing well because her business is the only retail business within the community.\r\n\r\nHannah requires a loan in order to buy more soft drinks, pure water, and cigarettes. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, Hannah plans to open a big shop. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1269523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is 24 years old, married and lives with his parents, grandparents, wife and infant child.  Egor\u2019s income source is the small amount he earns from his grocery store. Besides, his grandparents are provided with a retirement pension. As the existing income is not enough for the family, Egor decided to start a new business. In particular, he plans to finish the renovation of a store and rent it out for a good price. Egor has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. However, his loan request was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, for they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this loan, Egor will install doors and windows in his newly built store and renovate it properly so that it satisfies the personal needs of his clients. A private company has already expressed an interest in renting it. Egor hopes his business will be profitable and this will increase his income, providing his family with enough money to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living

Margarita tells us that a friend invited her to take out a loan in order to improve her avocado trees; this friend saw her trees and said \"These trees are in very bad shape; you need to fertilize them in order to have a good harvest\". Margarita replied \"The truth is that right now I don't have much capital to invest, and everything I would need to keep them in better shape is very expensive\". It was then that her friend invited her to form part of her group, called Chibaty, where they were taking out a loan to improve their businesses. Margarita decided to join because she wanted to improve her trees and thus help her husband to improve their living conditions. She says that she has 58 trees that are already 4 years old, and that they have not yielded much fruit because she has not been able to provide optimal maintenance. When it is harvest time, she goes to the central supply centre of a nearby village and sells her fruit in small bags; her harvest is not very large. She says that she hopes that, with this loan, she will be able to buy everything her trees need, such as fertilizers, manure, insecticides, and Calidra-brand lime. She says that she is grateful to Vision Fund because they will provide this loan. It will be of great use to her and she will benefit greatly. The other five group members are called Mar\u00eda Leucadia, Amelia, Irma, Mar\u00eda Crisanta, and Ausencia.

They are all happily married and live in a small village at the outskirts of Senapati District in the State of Manipur located in the North Eastern part of India. \r\n\r\nHoineikim is the profile member pictured with raised hand. She is 28 years old and is a mother to a son and two daughters. Her husband is a farmer by profession and often collects stones from the river to sell and earn income for the family. In order to supplement the family income, she joined the group to access loans.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she initiated a small store. In her store she sells sugar, milk-powder, 'paan', cigarettes, chewing tobacco and eatables. She managed to repay her loan from the profit and from time to time add to her husband's scanty income. With the second loan, she increased her store's stock and expanded her store with newer varieties to sell. She made progress because her income in terms of profit is doublefold. She was in a position to support her two older children's education and managed the family expenditures all from her business. She also started saving INR 500 on a monthly basis. The saving is done with a group of 30 members. Every month one member gets the collected amount and it continues till every member gets the collected amount. This is one of the trends that poor people here use to somehow try to meet their capital needs.\r\n\r\nHoineikim together with her husband wishes to buy one buffalo for his farming activities and reduce ploughing expenses and also to earn income when ploughing other fields and charging a fixed rate. She also dreams to support her children with good education facilities and for that she means to save as much as possible and is determined to do a good business for the future.\r\n\r\nShe needs loan to expand her store business. She wants to stock groceries items to sell such as potatoes, dal and rice for that matter. Likewise, the rest of her group members too need loan to facilitate their respective income activities. Among the group, four members undertook piggery farming, Two members do weaving, and another two members raise goats to sell and one member sells clothes.        \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1269516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To increase the store inventory of rice, potatoes, and dal (lentils).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jangvah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neikholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neikholam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhovah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoineikim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lheikhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingkhovah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-05T10:36:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":513650,"name":"Ekhlas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ekhlas, who is the applicant for this loan, is a 41-year-old conservative woman.

Yolanda says that she has always lived in the community.  She studied in secondary school.  She married Juan, who works as a mechanic.  They have been married for 22 years and together they formed a family with three children, two of whom are students.\r\n\r\nYolanda has had a grocery store for two-and-a-half years.  She started it because she and her husband talked about setting up the store and decided to do it.  She says it had always been one of her dreams to have her own store that she could run on her own.\r\n\r\nShe asked the institution for this loan to be able to stock her store.  Thanks to the loan she was able to buy detergent, soft drinks, milk, eggs, bread, snacks, etc.\r\n\r\nYolanda commented: \"I remember when I started the store we only had one shelf where we would put the perishables so they wouldn't spoil easily.  In time I managed to buy another counter that was bigger, and little by little I've been buying more things.  Thanks to the loan from the institution, for example, not long ago I got a bigger soft-drink case because the previous one is too small and I wasn't able to have as many soft drinks.\"\r\n\r\nYolanda comments that her biggest challenge is the competition around her, but she always tries to give the best service and have everything her customers request.  She says that one day a girl arrived to buy a pill that she didn't have, so she asked the girl to wait a moment and Yolanda got the pill from another store; it was more expensive, but she did it so she wouldn't look bad to her customer.\r\n\r\nNow her goal is to expand her store.  She thinks she already has all the groceries, and now she wants to add fruits and vegetables to increase her profits so she can help her children with their education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1265719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He says that the group named themselves this because this is what they call their community (it is not the real name of the neighborhood).  He says that he has worked in the buying and selling of avocados and seasonal fruits for a little over four years.  \r\n\r\nHe began this business because he did not have a stable job.  Since he did not study beyond primary school due to scarce economic resources, it is difficult for him to find a good job.  He says that various family members make a living in cultivating avocados.  He rents them the orchards to cut the avocado.  Then, they carry the fruit to sell in a Mexican state where they get a better price.  \r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan to rent an orchard.  The harvest for this fruit already began in the month of December, and he has to put capital together to pay for the rent and then go to sell.  He says that when it is not avocado season, he goes to the wholesale supply center in Zitacuaro to buy tomatoes, manzano chile peppers, onions, pineapple, papaya, strawberries, cherries, blackberries, and more.  He says that he has a small pick-up truck he uses to transport his fruit to areas where he can sell for more than at the street markets.  \r\n\r\nHe says that his goal is to buy land where he can cultivate his own avocados and have a better future.  \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Felipe, Ana Lilia, Guadalupe, and Roberto.  They will invest their credit in ingredients to make traditional Mexican dishes, for the purchase of Christmas Eve flowers to sell, to buy material to make thick walls to sell, and to buy seasonal fruits and vegetables to sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1267055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Land Rental","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to rent an avocado orchard to supply his sales at street markets.

She is about 27 years old and she is a mother to a son and two daughters. Her husband is a farmer by profession and grows rice from an inherited paddy field. During the off season her husband earns money on daily wage. In order to supplement the family income she sells rice house to house. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan she bought rice grains which she took to the mill to separate the husk from the grain. She would also sell from her granary to earn more profits. This is how the family's main source of income is generated. With her earning she managed her children's schooling requirements apart from the family maintenance. She has been saving as much as she could and wishes to purchase a ploughing machine (manually push and control) for her husband in the future. She believes that with the proposed machine she and her family can be in a better position financially. People here still use oxen and buffalo to plough the field. On the other hand the machine can be very convenient with regards to proper tilling of the field.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan to continue her business activities. She also wishes to multiple her income activities for her future plan. With part of the loan she wants to buy at least three piglets to raise and sell for profit.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too need another loan to improve upon their respective income activities. Among the group members three of them are in the rice business and another three are in the weaving sector. Two members own a general store; one undertook poultry farming and likewise one member raises pigs and another one sells cooked meat for a profit.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1269547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy unhulled rice to increase her stock and with part of the loan, buy piglets to raise for profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajiliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ningthaorei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gongkhemliu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thampui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muchungliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Acham","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Din ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adhun ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lugui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaipui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-05T22:12:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":513655,"name":"Luiza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luiza is 54 years old, single, and lives in Khobi district with her sister.

He is single and lives in the city of Ica. He is a very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who has a strong desire to overcome. Unfortunately, due to the lack of financial resources and the need for him to work, he was not able to get a professional degree in civil engineering though he would have really liked to do so. In his free time, he likes to continue working and on some occasions eat the delicious dish of rice with chicken, which is his favorite food.\r\nOf his own initiative, with a lot of determination and dedication, Emerson works as a construction operator.

The term literally means 'sunflower'.  They all belong to a TrIbal community. They all live in Thingkanphai village in Manipur state located in the North Eastern part of India. It takes about 3 and half hours' drive to reach it from the main city Imphal and the road connectivity is still characterized with a bumpy ride.\r\n\r\nHatneng is the profiled member, pictured with her hand raised. She is 45 years old and she is a mother to two sons and two daughters whose age is between 19 years to 25 years. The family's main source of income comes from her husband who is a government employee as a clerk under the District Administrative Office. All her children are going to college for a higher degree in the main city. In order to supplement the family income, she has been weaving since 1990. She weaves traditional clothes such as shawls (local name, 'Saipikhup') and wraparounds (local name, 'Khamtang') of varied colours and designs. Her saved income from this trade comes in very handy when her husband's salary is delayed 3 to 4 months at a stretch. The government trend of delayed payment to the employees here in Manipur is making things difficult for the people. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2009, she continued the same activities. Having woven for so long she already earned a good name in and around the neighbouring villages. This goes to say that her market options are well established. With her second loan she increased her production by hiring two more weavers to assist her. Her two daughters, having mastered the art, spent their school vacation weaving.  The method used to weave is that of a back strap loom.\r\nShe wishes and plans that her younger daughter aged 21 years now would go for a professional training in this art. She wants her to learn weaving using the modern techniques of weaving such as weaving by machine. Maybe down the road, she dreams of becoming an entrepreneur by inviting interested companies of such holding and manufacturer. For her future dream she has been saving for quite some time now already.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan to facilitate her weaving activity. She will use the loan to  stock yarns of different colours and texture to weave. She also wishes to do multiple income activities, namely piggery. Therefore, with part of the loan she also means to buy piglets to rear for profit.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group too needs this loan to start afresh with their respective activities hoping this New Year will bring them good fortune. All the members wish all the lenders around the world a joyous and prosperous 2013. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1269556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy stock of yarn in colours to weave and piglets to raise for profit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T18:20:08Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ngaineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chonghoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pipi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shineo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaineihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neiphal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongpineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-04T15:42:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":513659,"name":"Amal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Because Amal is a conservative person, she asked her son, Abdallah, to appear in the photo instead of her.\r\n\r\nAmal is 55 years old and a hard-working mother of five.
