He is a very hard-working and responsible person. His wife devotes herself to household tasks. He started to work with his father 20 years ago. He grows watermelon and corn, and his work schedule is from 6:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. The advantage is that when the weather is favorable the harvest is very productive. The disadvantage is selling his product, since the price tends to be low. Carlos needs the loan he is requesting to purchase watermelon seeds and to pay for his employees' labor. With the help of this loan, it will be easier for him to plant, since he will have the necessary capital to invest in the planting. The problems he faces at harvest time are the different infestations and insects that damage the crops.

Tomasa is a partner of the Communal Progress Bank of Caluyo \"Banco Comunal Progreso Caluyo\" in the community of Villa Santa Rosa in the sector of Sakakatani, Department of Puno.  Since she was young, she has been in the business of purchasing and selling starch made from corn, potatoes, broad beans, and quinoa.  Because of this, her business has been very profitable.  She continued with that business while she was raising her family, but her income was not enough to cover her household's expenses.  It was for this reason that she decided to change businesses.  <p>\r\n\r\nNow, she raises cattle.  With the encouragement of her maid of honor, she used her first loan of 300.00 Soles to purchase two sacks of bran, two sacks of soy, and growth hormones.  She has done this since 2005.  <p>\r\n\r\nWith a loan of 1,700.00 Soles ($600), which she will repay in six months, she will buy a two-horned bull to raise and two sacks of bran.  <p>\r\n\r\nHer business is going much better now and she is content with the income she makes by selling.  Her husband works with a tricycle in the city of Yunguyo and he supports her unconditionally in her business.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe is thirty years old and has studied through the third grade in school.  She has one son and three daughters, three of whom are studying in the community's education institute.

The planting and care of his crops is his biggest pleasure because, ever since he was a child, his father taught him to give thanks to God and to the earth.  Upon seeing his plants bear fruit he rejoices, as when he brings in the harvest he will have the opportunity to sell his products directly to an important market in the city of Lima.  He sends his harvest to the capital because this generates the best income and gives him the ability to pay the rent for the farm and buy fungicides in order to ward off plagues.  Upon completion of his own agricultural labors, Viviano looks for work on his neighbors\u2019 farms.  With the 15 soles a day they pay him, and the 12 soles a day they pay his wife, he is able to cover the household\u2019s daily costs of food.  For the moment, Viviano will continue to work arduously for the wellbeing of his children.  This is his fifth loan with MFP.  In the previous series, he demonstrated he was prompt in every one of his payments.  All the members of his communal bank recognize him and, in the same manner, he feels good with each of them.

Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). Martha lives in the Hato Mayor region of the Dominican Republic, located in the east of the country. Hato Mayor is a fairly mountainous region where the principal industry is agriculture. Martha's community, like nearly all impoverished areas in the Dominican Republic, suffers from a constant shortage of running water and electricity. As well as Dominicans, Haitian immigrants make up a large proportion of Martha's community.\n  \nShe has owned an underwear business (selling a variety of garments) for three years now and is applying for a loan to invest in stock to try and grow her business. She has previously taken out loans with Esperanza International (Kiva's Field Partner in the Dominican Republic and Haiti) but this will be her (and her group's) first Kiva loan. Martha will use her first loan with Esperanza to set up her business. She says that, since then, subsequent loans have allowed her to successfully grow the business. As a result, Martha says that her family has benefited, as has her local community, because now they don't have to travel so far to buy underwear. \n\nMartha says that her favorite pastimes are studying and spending time with her children. She also says that her most difficult challenge is finding the money to complete her studies. Her dream is simple, and applies to both the present and the future. She simply wants to keep doing things that make her a good person.

Amidou B. is 46 years old and lives in Agoe-Fiovi where he is active in the commercial sector.

His previous loans were wisely employed and have been repaid.  But we must take note that, times as they are, he cannot make ends meet for his family.  To do so, he is requesting a new loan in the amount of $950 to bolster his business by making volume purchases at a much lower price.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from French by David Pigott and Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteers.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur B.

Never having gone to school, as is true for most women of her age, she was initiated into commercial work at a tender age by her mother.  Developing in the food sector, notably in selling peanut butter, she has much business sense, thanks to 30 years of experience accumulated through doing this work. \r\n\r\nTo obtain peanut butter, the peanuts are sorted, roasted in an oven (very often built locally), peeled, winnowed, and then taken to the mill (for converting into a paste). The peanut butter obtained in this way is then put into plastic buckets.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program four years ago. After four solidarity loans (group loans) that were all correctly repaid, she is on her third individual loan. She intends to use this loan to buy 1,000 kg of peanuts and 50 plastic buckets (for conditioning the peanut butter). She gets her supplies locally in Koutiala from wholesale merchants who stock grains. She sells her production at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, out of her home and with the difference public services, to customers generally composed of women (housewives and retailers) and salaried workers. Her business cycle (purchasing, production, and sales) is one month in length.\r\n\r\nBecause of the quality of her peanut butter, Ms. Assitan Sidib\u00e9 enjoys a great reputation in this business of making peanut butter.  She receives many orders, especially from retailers and from families wanting to stock up against price fluctuations. She intends to realize a profit of 90,000 francs per month that she envisions using for covering the loan interest and for helping with the day-to-day expenses of the family. In the future, her ambition is to open a shop to become a peanut butter wholesaler. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They currently live in her mother-in-law's house. One year ago she had a little grocery store in a space her mother-in-law gave her in the house, but it wasn't very profitable because it competed with much bigger stores.\r\n\r\nShe decided to rent the space as a warehouse to a construction company, and, noticing that there were a lot of workers working there, she began a business selling breakfast and lunch to the workers. During the evenings, she sells food to-go from her front door. She's been doing this type of catering for 8 months and is doing very well.  What's more, Olga likes to cook, which means she eagerly attends to all her diners.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP. She is part of a community bank and is very happy because all the members of her group get along very well.  They are well-organized and don't have problems with missing payments. She will invest the money she is asking for in her new food-sale business, buying utensils and ingredients for preparing food. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":388409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying utensils and ingredients for catering business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T04:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":153.51},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":155.79},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":163.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":168.99},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":175.97},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":182.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.53},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.1},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.15},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.73,"local_amount":153.51,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":156.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997503},{"amount":54.53,"local_amount":155.79,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":159.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842850},{"amount":165.36,"local_amount":472.47,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":483.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734429},{"amount":12.48,"local_amount":35.66,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":36.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959609},{"amount":63.9,"local_amount":182.57,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":186.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992413}],"funded_date":"2009-09-15T17:03:32Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lydia Brantley","image":null}},{"id":141058,"name":"Mary Luz Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":" \nLas integrantes del grupo Mary Luz son Mary Luz U., Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora M.

Her previous loan of PHP 30,000 was used to fund operations for her business and had a positive impact in  both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, she is borrowing PHP 29,000 for her thirteenth cycle loan, which she intends to use for her business. Elizabeth is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family: to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon  word that means \"Honorable\").

Rosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Rosa is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Rosa's second loan from ASKI.

Mar\u00eda is an enterprising woman who does not like being idle.  She works very hard to have a better life and build up savings for when her husband returns.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria manages a store where she sells bread, beverages, hair gels, and toothpaste.  Her business is small, but she has every intention to make it grow.  In the evenings, she prepares \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pupusa\" target=\"_blank\" >pupusas<\/a>\u201d which are traditional in Salvadoran cuisine and made of corn, beans, and cheese, though they can be served with other ingredients.  Maria operates both businesses from her home in the Department of San Miguel.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan in order to buy food products such as eggs, bread, instant soups, and other items.  Maria will also acquire ingredients in bulk for making pupusas, since they are in great demand because they taste good.  She is determined to provide her three children with a better life and give them everything they need.  They are the main reason why she continues to work and invest great effort every day.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or about $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Orepa joined SPBD.

Her business is located in Nwingi and served by the Thika Branch. Thika is the region in Kenya known for production of pineapples. \r\n\r\nShe has been selling clothes, shawls and bed sheets for a long time. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is hawking (selling on the street by calling out loud) over long distances.

It is for this reason that Zosimo is asking MFP where they attended to his request for a loan. He is now hoping to finalize his plans soon, that is having a workshop making furniture from wood.

Meet Joseph from Kapsowar, Kenya, who is a man from a community not known for farming, but he is earning a living through agriculture. He is happily married, and together with his wife, is blessed with a lovely family. \r\n\r\nFor the past 15 years, he has been practicing mixed farming, and because of his experience, he commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and is regarded as a mentor. Income from milk, eggs, and doing a small personal business has allowed him to earn a decent living. \r\n\r\nJoseph passionately loves dairy farming, and the animals on his farm have been given names. Milking and feeding his animals makes him very proud. Through milk selling, he has had quite good returns, and demand for milk has been growing. He uses his mobile phone a lot, firstly to receive orders from customers, and then to send a message to them when the milk is ready for collection. Because of using his mobile phone, he has had a competitive edge in his dairy business. \r\n\r\nDemand has been overwhelming, and he now needs another cow to fully satisfy demand. Therefore, he is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Joseph does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow, but he wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich, creamy milk. The dairy cow will produce between 10-20 liters of milk a day. The increased milk production will translate into more income, and Joseph will be able to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-going children. \r\n\r\nWhen anybody listens to Joseph speak, one cannot fail to see that he is an expert in dairy farming. With his passion and determination, he intends to beat all odds. This loan will change Joseph's living standards, and there is no doubt that you can find rewarding employment in dairy farming."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1836289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4832.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4973.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5118.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5268.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5580.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5743.68},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5911.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6084.35},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6262.12},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6445.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6633.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":990899,"name":"Afi","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Afi est une veuve femme  \u00e2g\u00e9e de 54 ans qui vit \u00e0 Baguida.

She lives in the Lafiabougou district in Selingu\u00e9 (one of the sous-prefectures of Yanfolila, third administrative region of Mali). Since her youth, she began earning money, notably by selling cosmetics. Despite her courage and will to succeed, she quickly ran into financial difficulties. To solve this problem, she joined in a group loan through Soro Yiriwaso 3 years ago.  As her business and her clientele grew rapidly, she moved on to requesting an individual loan and is presently on her fourth loan. Her little shop is located on the main road of Selingu\u00e9 and is well-patronized. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan she intends to buy a lot of bottles of perfume, wigs, and other beauty products so as to be ready for the increased sales around Ramadan and the new school year. She does her buying in Bamako once a month and makes her sales in Selingu\u00e9 in her shop, for cash or credit, to a clientele composed of the women of Selingu\u00e9 and those coming from surrounding towns. She has a good reputation because of her experience and mastery of her business. <P>\r\n\r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of 95,000F CFA which she will use to increase her working capital and she would like to start up a beauty salon which is a pressing need for her clientele. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

After having done many kinds of work without success, she got initiated in this work buying and selling pasta and cassava tubers in order to make \"atti\u00e9k\u00e9\".  She learned how to do this twenty years ago from a neighbor from the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.  She works at home in the company of her friends.  Because of the quality of her products, she is in high demand by her customers, who come to buy wholesale and to sell retail.\r\n<p>\r\nTo satisfy her growing customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago.  After three solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, with a women's association in her district (Association SABALY de Sanooubougou I), she is on her second PIC (a commercial individual loan).  She intends to use the loan to buy 30 sacks of cassava pasta (ti\u00e8k\u00e8doro) in Bouak\u00e9 (in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) and 15 sacks of cassava in Sikasso in order to mix them to make good quality atti\u00e9k\u00e9.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause of her work experience in the district, she sells her merchandise to customers composed mostly of women, cash or credit accepted.  With this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":255180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy pasta and cassava root","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T06:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:14Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889543},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440330},{"amount":78.13,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135704},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033505},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620873},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019838},{"amount":78.11,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242602},{"amount":78.16,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678128}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T11:27:18Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":87762,"name":"Nortoji","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nortoji is a very hard-working woman.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is a well-known place in the city that attracts many people all year round.  Local citizens come here to wash and also to get haircuts at the on-site hair salon.

Rustam is 34 years old. He is married with three adorable children. Rustam has always opted to make his life in his land and work hard and grow with it. That is why he decided to rear cows and dedicated himself to agriculture. He has been doing this kind of work for a very long time, for he comes from a family with an entirely agricultural background. <P>\r\n\r\nToday Rustam wishes to increase the number of his cattle and for this reason, he would like to buy calves with the hope of increasing his income and the well-being of his home with the innumerable benefits that these special little animals provide him. That\u2019s why he is requesting a loan of 1900 USD. Extend your solidarity to Rustam so that he can move forth successfully and accomplish all his goals.   <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in a rented house along with her two children: Antony, who is 11, and Candy, who is 2 years old.  She wants to give them a good education.  Martina has an itinerant business selling clothing; each day she goes through public and private institutions in her city looking for customers who want to buy something that she sells.  She brings the clothing from another city, and for this reason the fashions that she sells are very new and eye-catching.  What she likes most about her job is advising her customers about the clothing styles that are in fashion.  She has been carrying out this activity for 3 years, and she considers that the most difficult part is to have to walk all day in search of customers.  In the future, she hopes to have sufficient money to open up a store where she can sell at her leisure with greater comfort.  This is her first loan with MFP, and she is ready to work very hard in order to make her payments.

The money she is asking for will go towards the purchase of a variety of merchandise to better stock her store and to begin to expand it. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":483904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-06T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":147.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":158.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":164.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":169.97},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":176.6},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":182.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.8},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.49},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.81},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.77,"local_amount":162.19,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":162.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993182},{"amount":13.2,"local_amount":37.72,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":37.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717967},{"amount":94.86,"local_amount":271.04,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":271.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751643},{"amount":71.08,"local_amount":203.08,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":203.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934109},{"amount":114.09,"local_amount":325.97,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":326.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672884}],"funded_date":"2010-02-07T01:45:30Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

She buys as much as she needs and clients put in orders. She sells on credit, and every so often, when her regular clients have income, she collects payments.  She also sells cosmetics that clients pre-order from catalogs, and collects payment as she does with her other products. She's been working in both businesses for three years and thus far has worked by herself. Her husband works for a state entity.\r\n\r\nWhat Tatiana likes about her work is that she travels every two months and enjoys  the trips. The work also allows her time to work in her house. This will be her first loan with MFP, so she assures us that she will make her payments on time.

grew large and were then divided to reduce the number of ladies in each group. Thus this new group of entrepreneurs was formed. <p>These ladies are enterprising women, who above and beyond managing their own microbusinesses are also mothers and housewives.  They persist daily  to maintain their families. Their principal motivation is their children, since they all desire that their children study and have better luck than their mothers have had. <p>Currently these women are in the third cycle of the program. They manage a line of credit of from 300, 000 guaranies (Paraguayan currency) to 800,000 guaranies per member. Currently there are 16 members; each works in a different activity, such as lingerie sales, sales of fast food, jewelry sales, fruit and vegetable sales, beverage sales, sweets, products by catalog, etc. <p> They possess a great enterprising spirit and want to continue growing. They are happy with the program since the training they receive helps them a lot. The loans are also a great help since the women invest them in their microbusinesses. Currently they are requesting a new loan which they want to invest in the purchase of merchandise to sell. <p><p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>El comit\u00e9 denominado \u201cMujeres SolidA.\u201d de la compa\u00f1\u00eda Villa Madrid de Limpio se formo gracias a otros grupos que se formaron anteriormente y para reducir el n\u00famero de se\u00f1oras se dividieron y formaron otro grupo m\u00e1s. <p>\r\nEstas se\u00f1oras son mujeres emprendedoras, que adem\u00e1s de manejar sus propias microempresas tambi\u00e9n son madres y amas de casa.

In 2000, she left Sofala for Maputo through the church she attended and was involved in. She set up residence in Boane where she still lives. She has her own home located in zone 07.\r\nIn 2006, she opened up a business that sold tobacco and, in 2007, she introduced a chicken raising and slaughtering business with help from an assistant. She learned how to raise chickens with friends and she has been doing it for a year now. The venture has been doing well despite difficulties in transportation and the rising cost of purchasing hens and tobacco. Weekly, she can sell up to 700,00mt - she has sold a can of tobacco (250g) for 10,00mt and a chicken for 90,00mt. She has not started to save yet because she prefers to invest all in the business.\r\nThis is her third loan from Hluvuku. The first two were used to purchase tobacco and with the profits she strenghtened the chicken raising business. She now requests 14500,00mt to expand her chicken raising business. \r\nAdriana wishes to pay back the loan early so that she can request another loan to build additional aviaries and improve her housing conditions.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nAdriana Bernardo L. tem 41 anos de idade, natural de Caia provincia de Sofala ao centro de Mo\u00e7ambique.

She is a 45-year-old mother of five children, two of whom are construction workers while the others are attending the local school. Her husband is also in the photo.

He is 21 years old, single and lives in his parent\u2019s house. He really feels like doing something to improve his life and succeed. He earns a living taking his customers from one place to another. Inseparable from his taxi, he drives up and down the streets of the town of Puno looking for people who wish to use fast and safe transport. Steve really likes his job, he can walk through the streets of the town and relax. He enjoys driving so much that he had hardly reached adulthood when he decided to work as a taxi driver and has now been working as one for 3 years. He longs to one day have a taxi company and thereby improve his finances. The most difficult part of his job is to know how to decide where passengers will be and which places to go to.\r\nThere is always the underlying danger that something bad could happen to him yet Steve continues to work every day without a break. He is looking to achieve his goals and is ready to do everything possible to succeed. This is his second loan through MFP. He knows that he must make all of his payments on time and is ready to do so. He is very responsible in his community bank because, being the only man, he does not want to do something wrong in front of the rest of the female partners. The money that he is asking for is to fix up his taxi, as lately it has been breaking down a lot and this is causing him to lose money.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lara Francis, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":289810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Taxi repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-20T21:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":233},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":233},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":233},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":233},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":233},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":235}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74.89},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.89},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.89},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.89},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.89},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74.89,"local_amount":233,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":238.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117273},{"amount":74.89,"local_amount":233,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":238.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012196},{"amount":74.89,"local_amount":233,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":238.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595777},{"amount":74.89,"local_amount":233,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":238.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990044},{"amount":74.89,"local_amount":233,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":238.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211177},{"amount":75.55,"local_amount":235,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":240.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640687}],"funded_date":"2009-03-20T21:59:52Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lara Francis","image":null}},{"id":100066,"name":"Robiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the past six months she has sold peeled and chopped potatoes. Before this she made and sold dessert portions of gelatin and with her savings she decided to buy what is now her basic tool for her work: a potato mincer, with which she can chop up to 100 kilos a day. With the help of her husband she distributes this product to the main restaurants in her neighborhood and in a provincial village. Her profits are satisfactory and make up for the great physical effort that she exerts, including waking up at dawn to get started with her work.

She is 45 years old, divorced and mother of two, who are 25 and 18 years old. The younger of her children is attending school. She has studied up to 5th grade, and she hasn't continued to study because of her parents' financial problems. She lives in her own house with her two sons. She also supports her mother, who lives in Mahelane, Namaacha district, by sending her food. \r\n<p>\r\nThey left Chibuto in 1992 to Maputo (Hulene neighborhood) for a relative's house when she divorced her husband. They were facing various difficulties in life and she decided to move to Mahelane and search for work. She started working in 2002 in a company that produces and sells banana (Bananalandia). There, she works about 12 hours a day. She has learned this activity from her parents in Chibuto, in 1972. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has never worked with other credit institutions. She learned about Hluvuku from a niece and co-worker, who is also one of the institution's clients. This is her first loan, of MZN 10,000.00 ($350).

lives in GMA, Cavite City, Philippines. She is 36 and married to Ferdinand, an overseas contract worker, with whom she has three children. Her oldest child is already in college, while the youngest is still in elementary school. Along with her husband, she works hard to provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLilibeth sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through direct sales programs such as Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. When a customer orders a product, Lilibeth orders it from the company, and the customer is given one month to pay his or her bill. Her customers are her neighbors and people in her community.  Each week, she earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from sales.\r\n\r\nLilibeth plans to use this 10,000 PHP loan as up-front cash to fulfill orders for her customers.

Her greatest wish is to provide them with a good education so she works hard to do this. \r\n\r\nThe green fields of the small town of Santa Rosa are part of Lurgia\u2019s life. It\u2019s a pleasant place in which to work. As a small child she was taught by her parents how to work the land, and now she has her own fields where she and her husband grow coffee. It\u2019s demanding work that takes up all their time. Lurgia most enjoys harvest time when she feels that the months of hard work have paid off in high quality coffee. She\u2019s been doing this work for four months and considers that the most difficult part of the job is transporting the coffee from the fields to the warehouses in Santa Rosa.\r\n\r\nWith the loan Lurgia will buy coffee plants so she can have a good harvest.

He is married. Marvin has three children whose ages are the following: his eldest son is 12 years old and is in his first year of secondary school. His other son is 10 years old and is in the 5th grade. His daughter is 8 years old and is the 4th grate. His life partner sells pastries and cosmetics. Marvin's goals are to increase his business enough to prevail since he always has been a person who does not neglect his responsibilities such as the support of his family. HIs dreams are to purchase a property for his children since where they live now belongs to his mother-in-law since they do not have the necessary resources to rent a house where they may live. He would also like to establish a pastry business for his wife since this would be a good fountain of income.\r\n\r\nMarvin's economic activity is selling general merchandise such as shorts, blouses, pants and underwear. He conducts business on foot. He's owned this business for nine years. Marvin started this business through family since, since he was young, his family taught him to earn money in an honest way. At the young age of 18, he began to sell products such as underwear and socks for men for which he traveled to different markets in search of customers to whom he could offer his merchandise. One of the most difficult things that he came across was starting without the support of his family. He decided to overcome this on his own and get his family ahead. His love for the work helped him obtain the business that he currently runs and for which he now needs a loan to purchase products since he thinks he will invest this money well so that his children will not have to go through the same difficulties that he encountered in order to support the business he possesses now.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":267641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-08T22:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marvin German ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":416.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.85,"local_amount":437.08,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":440.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092063},{"amount":19.81,"local_amount":396.26,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":399.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985445},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":419.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446061},{"amount":45.96,"local_amount":919.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":926.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956698},{"amount":16.53,"local_amount":330.85,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":333.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599724},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":419.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599725},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":419.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035614},{"amount":83.36,"local_amount":1666.64,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1679.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948017}],"funded_date":"2009-02-09T04:22:57Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T21:41:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":91890,"name":"Lorelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorelyn F. is a rice grower.

His main crop is artichokes, one of the most common products in his location.  Every day he cares for his fields where he also planted potatoes a short while ago.  Juan insures that his plants are developing correctly and prevents illnesses and pests from attacking.  Currently, he also raises guinea pigs, for which he equipped space in his home.  Juan states that his parents are his main source of support but that he, too, is an important contributor to the household economy.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is 47 years old, married and the mother of three children aged 30, 27 and 21, all of them out of school. She finished 7th grade but had to stop it due to lack of financial support. She left Maputo to go live in Boane and works as a cleaner at the University Instituto Politecnico since 1983. She has no employees and makes U$80 per month that she uses to support her housenold, and with the help of her husband she's able to save some in the bank.\r\n\r\nShe never had other loans and heard of Hluvuku through her neighbors that are also clients of the institution. This is her 6th loan in the amount of U$775 that she'll use to continue building her house. The previous loans were all for housing and consumer goods. She is committed to pay this one back in time as well, and hopefully apply for more loans in the future in order to build a new wall in her house. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

It is located an hour and forty-five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor three years, she has been offering a cargo and passenger transportation service in a motorcycle taxi (a motorized vehicle that consists of a motorcylce with a cabin attached).  As the owner, she rents it out so that it can work the routes that link Olmos to different communities.  This activity constitutes an important income source for her family. \r\n\r\nThe continuous use of this vehicle and the poor condition of the roads in the area have caused the motorcyle taxi to undergo some serious problems that require some urgent repair to guarantee its correct use. That is why she has asked Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1500 nuevos soles that will help her acheive her goal. \r\n\r\nFelicita is a responsible and hardworking woman. Her greatest wish is to keep working to acquire one more vehicle with which she can make more income that will help her get her family ahead. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":561792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repair and maintenance expenses for a motorcycle taxi.

Her husband, Jaime D., who is 59 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have thirteen children who are from 4 to 32 years old.\r\n\r\nBibingka is baked rice cake made from rice flour and coconut, while torta is anything dipped in egg-batter and deep fried. \r\n\r\nLiberata joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,600, uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th loan, Liberata is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her businesses so that she can continue to save for her plan to buy new equipment for her bibingka and torta business.\r\n\r\nLiberata is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Diosa has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Diosa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Diosa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Diosa from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

\u201chandymen\u201d, as he calls it. His grandfather owned a welding shop and did repairs for people on the side. His father was also a well-known handyman in the Lubbock area. After the father\u2019s recent death, James and his wife used their savings and turned the family trade into an actual business, complete with a name and a logo, Lonestar Repair and Remodeling. Before James made this decision, he had worked for a variety of construction companies and was promoted quickly despite his young age. James says, \u201cI\u2019ve been in construction since I could swing a hammer\u201d. However, following in his father\u2019s footsteps, James was not happy working for other people and knew that his dream was to be self-employed. It was not too difficult to secure the first clients as they have been loyal customers to his family for years. James says, \u201cI live in Lubbock, known as the biggest small town. Whenever you do something, everybody knows about it and that can be a good thing and that can be a bad thing. But, for me, it\u2019s a good thing. Word of mouth is really what grows my company.\u201d \r\n\r\n\tWith this loan, James will buy a paint sprayer, a job-site table saw, two nail guns and a cordless multi-tool kit that will allow him to take on more complicated jobs. James employs his two younger brothers part-time but they both have other jobs. He is excited to expand his customer base so that  he can employ people full-time. With his wife at Wayland Baptist University studying to be a teacher, the couple are on a tight budget. Lucky for James, his wife is an \u201cextreme budgeter\u201d and can make a dollar stretch. James\u2019 marketing plan is to be an honest businessman with a good work ethic. He believes that through word of mouth, people will choose him because of his affordable and fair prices.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":621885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Paint

","en":"Nely, 45, lives in the southwest of the city with her spouse and two children who are 14 and 16 years old.  She sells assorted merchandise, an activity she started in order to generate income to help meet household expenses, especially those related to the education of her children.  Her dream is to have a store where she can display her wares because she currently works part time at a school and most of her customers are the teachers, parents and students to whom she sells merchandise on credit and sells puddings and sandwiches for cash.  They pay cash for their purchases and sometimes on credit too because she manages a specialized catalogue through which she displays products like cosmetics, perfume, clothes and often footwear but she also sells other things that she buys directly from other suppliers and is able to fill customer orders for items not included in the catalogue.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Nely works diligently maintaining a 25% profit margin on sales and a 6 day accounts receivable turnover rate, financial indicators from which we can project potential growth and a successful investment of the Kiva loan, her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy clothes, cosmetics and perfume taking advantage of the approaching day of love and friendship when sales increase because her customers want to give signs of affection to their loved ones, family members and friends through gifts purchased from

Con los ingresos obtenidos ella  le brinda lo necesario a su hija, y paga el alquiler de la casa donde viven.\n\nDebido a que la se\u00f1ora Ada esta viendo que su negocio le esta siendo rentable, ella solicita a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayudar\u00e1 a comprar mayor cantidad de insumos. De esta manera ella podr\u00e1 elaborar m\u00e1s hamacas, ya que las vende muy r\u00e1pido.\n\nDe los ingresos que obtenga de la venta de sus hamacas la se\u00f1ora Ada planea ahorrar para darle a su hija la oportunidad de estudiar, ya que ella no la tuvo. En un futuro la se\u00f1ora Ada tambi\u00e9n desea adquirir una casa propia donde pueda vivir junto a su peque\u00f1a hija.\n","en":"Ada, 29, is a single mother living with her 7-year-old daughter.  She is a very hardworking woman who has been making hammocks for the last 7 years.  Her parents taught her this skill so that she\u2019d have a source of income.\r\n\r\nAda must travel every two weeks to buy the necessary supplies to make her hammocks.  She does this in the company of her little daughter.  The trip takes about half an hour by bus.  Once she makes the hammocks she goes out on foot to sell them door to door in neighboring communities.  Income earned allows her to provide what\u2019s needed for her daughter and to pay the rent on her house.\r\n\r\nBecause Ada has been noticing that her business is becoming profitable, she asks Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan that will help her buy larger amounts of supplies so that she can make more hammocks since she sells them very quickly.\r\n\r\nAda plans to save part of the income obtained from the hammock sales to provide her daughter with an opportunity to go to school, since she herself never had that opportunity.  In future, Ada also wants to acquire a house of her own to live in with her little girl.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":876501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Fidaa' runs a grocery store but does not have enough money to increase the variety of items she sells.\r\n\r\nFidaa\u2019 is requesting a loan from FATEN to purchase grocery items to increase her competitiveness and profit. This will improve her family\u2019s living conditions. She will repay her loan on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

Known for its sandy beaches, Pre-Incan ruins, and production of the beloved national liquor, Pisco (a type of grape brandy), Mila has long been a tourist destination for wealthy Peruvians.  Mila is a warm and quiet city that has a large Afro-Peruvian population.  The remains of an indigenous trail are located here and the influence of the Spanish empire is evident. The city, along with others near the Pacific coast, was damaged during the earthquakes in 2001 and 2007 but bore nature\u2019s beatings as it has for much of its history.  As is well known, Per\u00fa is characterized by the most delicious meals in the world and one of Iveth\u2019s favorite dishes is milanesa (a typical meat dish dipped in egg and bread crumbs).\r\n\r\nIveth studied until the fifth year in high school but would very much like to study Graphic Design.  Iveth is a single mother and has a little boy who is only one year old.  She is very tenacious and works about ten hours a day selling fruit.   When she was a little girl, Iveth helped her mother sell fruit and learned what it means to earn bread from the sweat of the brow.  This experience encouraged her to have her own business and she has well learned how to manage it in the same way.  On any given day, she may have as many as 70 customers and this allows her to earn approximately S\/. 400 daily.   On a good day she may earn S\/. 650, which helps her with some of the extra household expenses, especially the expenses for her one year old baby.  She believes that the success of her business is due to the variety and quality of the products she offers.\r\n\r\nToday, she is very grateful for the Kiva loans because thanks to the support offered, she has been able to buy scaffolding and materials for her business.  This improvement will help her to increase her business and obtain better income in order to improve the quality of life for her family. In addition, she will be able to have a sales stand in her home in a few months where she will offer fruits and later sell wholesale soft drinks.   She will use the loan to continue investing in her business and it will help her in the future to fulfill her great dream: to have a wholesale soft drink business.  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":963066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase scaffolding and materials.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 68 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of KES 5,349 (shillings) to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Manasse is pictured on the right of the group, with his hand raised.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nManasse is married and he has eight children. He is 68 years old and is known as friendly, hard-working, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community, in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Manasse has been a farmer for 30 years. He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year, by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nManasse joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. He joined One Acre Fund, so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough money to feed his family and send his children to school. \n\nBecause he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Manasse has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund, as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Manasse's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \n\nIn the future, Manasse hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, buy a goat, and invest in a business.  \n\nManasse's Group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. \n\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\n\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and

But with courage and determination, Mr. AGBA managed to overcome difficulties and provide for his family\u2019s needs. With the increasing use of motorbikes by the population of Togo, mainly in the capital city, the demand for engine oil is on the rise, and Mr AGBA fails to meet the needs of engine oil. He therefore wants to increase the volume of his stock of engine oil so that he can meet his customers\u2019 needs, and have a source of income for the welfare of his family.\r\n\r\nThe financing of $ 650 he requested will help him keep his stock of engine oil, constantly renewed.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur AGBA K. est n\u00e9 en 1970 \u00e0 Gati dans la pr\u00e9fecture du Zio.
