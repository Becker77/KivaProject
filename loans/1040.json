He lives with his wife, 2 children and mother. His mother is provided with a retirement pension. Amiran requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of the low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 2 milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese production. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land where different kinds of vegetables are grown and 5 beehives with bee colonies. They sell the harvested products and cheese locally in an open market at a good price, but it is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistent poor category. \r\n\r\nAmiran requested loan from Credo to start-up a business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-up and re-startup with credits on soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Amiran will purchase a minibus. After the purchase, he will transport people from his village to Batumi and get a salary. He hopes his project will be profitable and the new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of his family.

His loan request was always rejected because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nZurab's family is involved in a small-scale agricultural business. They run a family-owned poultry farm with 35 hens and sells on average 100-200 eggs per month.  Zurab also grows maize on the family-owned land and sells seasonally.  In addition, he works as a machine operator and gets a small monthly salary. But it is not enough to provide Zurab and his family with adequate living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistent poor category. \r\n\r\nZurab has requested a loan from Credo to re-start his family business, which was stopped a couple of years ago because of financial problems. His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-up and re-start-up with fewer conditions, to the country's rural poor. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, and they often do not have access to credit. \r\n\r\nWith the credit, Zurab will renovate the shed and purchase chickens to start a poultry farm. He will place the chickens in a shed, raise and sell the chickens for a higher price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1269571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"repair

This will ensure a better future for Meryam and improve her conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Dice  que tambi\u00e9n le comprara alimento, vitaminas, desparacitantes para tenerlos en mejor estado y as\u00ed venderlos a un mejor precio. Platica que en el mes de diciembre es cuando mejor ventas tiene y cuando son las clausuras de las escuelas ya  que  por las fiestas que hacen y las tradiciones de su comunidad hacen demasiada comida e invitan gente de otras comunidades  para festejar las fiestas.

This is because he never studied, as his parents did not have the means to send him to school and the closest one was very far away from his community at that time.  \r\n\r\nAt the moment, he has 13 sheep and is requesting a loan to maintain their pen, because bad weather and its bad state of repair have already led to the death of several lambs, and it is cold and hails in his community. He also says that he will buy food, vitamins, and deparasiting treatments to keep them in better condition and thus sell them for a better price. \r\n\r\nHe explains that in December he makes the most sales and the schools close. Due to the celebrations held and traditions of his community they make a lot of food and invite people from other communities to celebrate the holidays. Don Silvino says that if he gets a loan he can improve his business and he feels grateful to VisionFund. The other members of the group are called Gonzalo, Albina and Eliseo.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

For the past three years, he has been selling home products from his store, which is situated in a good location in the center of the market and is well known among customers. His business is profitable and is his only source of income; however, it needs more support from time to time to cover some costs.\r\n\r\n<p>Momen is requesting a Murabaha loan from FATEN (see below) to cover the cost of purchasing a new collection of home products to sell. This will increase sales and improve his income positively. Momen is photographed inside his store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He lives with his wife, 2 children and his mother. On several occasions, Zaza has requested loans from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but has had no success. His loan requests were always rejected because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family's only source of income is from agricultural activities. They have a cow, whose milk is used in dairy products, which they sell locally in an open market at a good price. However, it is hardly enough to feed the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nZaza requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative through Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Zaza will use this loan to purchase tires and an accumulator for his truck. After fixing up his truck, he will be able to get orders and transport goods. This will increase the family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1269590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase tires and an accumulator for his truck","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Maghlaki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaza","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":32.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":38.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":39.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":42.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":43.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":44.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":47.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.24,"local_amount":32.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":35.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339566111},{"amount":23.49,"local_amount":36.15,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":38.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115697},{"amount":25.06,"local_amount":38.55,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":41.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861179},{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":38.45,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":41.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569984},{"amount":25.99,"local_amount":39.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":43.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968617},{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":40.86,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":44.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749032},{"amount":177.67,"local_amount":273.34,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":294.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612940}],"funded_date":"2013-01-05T02:36:32Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:13:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":513696,"name":"Jamil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamil is a 32-year-old man living in Kyenjojo, Uganda.

Rosa says that the farm work is sacrificial, but she does it with love since her son helps her and it provides good income to her loving son and covers all the necessities.\r\nThe dream that Rosa has is to have a small farm with many cattle for being a distributor of milk and selling in the markets and in the surrounding communities where she lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1269644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to invest in the purchase of 2 cows for raising and reproduction.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Ambato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":188,"posted_date":"2013-01-03T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-02T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":69.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":70.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":71.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":73.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.43,"local_amount":63.43,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339515065},{"amount":64.75,"local_amount":64.75,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-29T08:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":64.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347066987},{"amount":67.24,"local_amount":67.24,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-01T09:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":67.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356674314},{"amount":67.49,"local_amount":67.49,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-31T08:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":67.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364523249},{"amount":69.18,"local_amount":69.18,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":69.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924213},{"amount":70.33,"local_amount":70.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-02T09:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":70.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701425},{"amount":71.99,"local_amount":71.99,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-06T08:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":71.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390563910},{"amount":73.28,"local_amount":73.28,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-01T09:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":73.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399812996},{"amount":74.81,"local_amount":74.81,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":74.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410088855},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-03T10:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419854831}],"funded_date":"2013-01-04T19:32:57Z","paid_date":"2013-12-03T10:20:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Yamaoka","image":784416}},{"id":513700,"name":"Rashid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rashid, 40 years old, lives in a small village in the Tetritskaro District with his wife and two children (5 and 22 years old).

She is originally from an indigenous community located within the boundaries of the state of Michoac\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico, where the majority of the people speak the dialect Mazahua. Elia is a hard working woman and several of the members of the group called T\u2019jiaru invited her because they know that she is a responsible and hardworking woman. She says that it is the first time that she is entering a loan and that she is enthusiastic because with the loan she believes that she will improve her business. She sells secondhand clothing for a living. She says that she began this business because where she worked as a domestic employee in M\u00e9xico City, her customer gifted her clothing and that was not being used and she began to sell to people from her community. After she began to go to the flea market to stock clothing to sell in the community, she said that she sold mostly children's clothes and at prices that are not expensive so her customers can buy more. She says that it is a good business because although her small son is dependent on her, as he is only 3 years old, she can also contribute to the expenses of the house. The other members of the group are named Aurelia, Karina, Alejandr\u00eda, Roc\u00edo and Mar\u00eda Clara.

She is a hard worker and wants to get ahead in life.  She is 44 years old.  Her parents didn't send her to school because people thought at the time that women had to take care of the children and domestic chores.  \r\n\r\nTeresa likes staying at home but she also thought that she would like to make her own money in order to help her spouse with the expenses for the children and house.  For this reason, she decided to grow avocados.  They own a broad plot of land and decided to plant avocados to put the land to use.  Teresa says: \"A little more than 15 years ago I bought avocado plants with the hope that one day they would yield a crop.  Now I am one of the women in my community selling the most avocados, given that I have 150 trees of this fruit.  I am very proud that my husband and I together have made many gains in getting ahead with our garden.  Each year tons of buyers come to our town because we sell very high quality fruit.\"  \r\n\r\nTeresa is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers, organic fertilizers and calidra (to prevent plagues) in order to improve her trees.  She is grateful that with the loan she can improve her business.  The other members of her group include Antolina, Maria Santa, Maria del Carmen, Maria Elena, Gilberta and Teresa.

Seven months ago he decided to invest his savings in the purchase of cakes and sweets that he sells from a room of his house. He has come up with this job idea because his severe backache prevents him from engaging in heavy jobs. Luis hopes that his new project will grant him a goof income as this is the only source of income he has to provide for himself and his family.

All are very responsible and hardworking. They chose this name for the group because Santa Rosa is the patron saint of their town, and she is one of the most famous virgins in the community where they live.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cristina is one of the members. She is 52 years old and has been married to Sr. Silverio for 36 years. They have six children, all of whom have now left home. Cristina has a grocery store which she opened after running her Mexican snacks stall for four years. She says that she very much enjoys selling things and making her customers happy. She is now seeking a loan from the institution to buy more stock for her store such as bread, eggs, milk, soft drinks, and Sabrita snacks.\r\n\r\nShe relates a bad experience she had: \u201cIn the past I had no interest in loans. But then one day I was offered one, and I had to take it because some men stole all my stock. I was left with nothing, so I was forced to take a loan to restart my business.

She is now separated from her husband, but their marriage lasted for many years. She has nine adult children and lives in her own house which she obtained through her marriage. She shares it with a daughter, and both put in a lot of effort to make a comfortable life for themselves.\r\n\r\nPaquita earns her living buying and selling bananas and grains such as maize, beans, soya and others depending on the season. She gets up early every day to get to the main entry to the town where she obtains the items she will then sell at the same place or from her own home. She says that her business is profitable as her income is very good.\r\n\r\nPaquita has been doing this work for about seven years and has always had help from her children, or from other people who load the bunches of bananas or the heavy sacks of grain for her. She really enjoys her work as it brings in a good income. The only difficulty she has is having to get up very early. However, she knows that this is part of her work and she has to continue putting in a lot of effort to earn the money she needs to buy necessities. She expects to continue working in this way and later on buy her own fishing boat.\r\n\r\nThis is Paquita\u2019s eighth loan with MFP, and she is very grateful for this loan opportunity and for the trust put in her. On her part she promises to pay back the money punctually. She is grateful to be part of a community bank where the members are responsible, committed people. \r\n\r\nWith the money she is seeking (S\/. 2000), she plans to buy 25 bags of maize. One bag costs 45 soles. With the rest of the money she will buy bunches of bananas to sell from her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1269686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy 25 sacks of maize and bunches of bananas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paquita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":294.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":318.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":330.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":332.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":355.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":367.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.71},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.71,"local_amount":294.27,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":300.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573175},{"amount":127.52,"local_amount":318.81,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":325.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122817},{"amount":132.28,"local_amount":330.7,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":337.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868640},{"amount":133.2,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":339.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577474},{"amount":142.18,"local_amount":355.45,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":362.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529711},{"amount":147.11,"local_amount":367.78,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":374.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974742}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T08:48:07Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":513867,"name":"Margaet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is 24 years old and married with two children.

She lives with Hemilton, with whom she has two children, who are 10 and 6 years old.  She lives with all of them in her own home and it is there that she confronts the difficulties of getting ahead every day. \r\n\r\nMarianela has a business selling groceries, such as rice, milk, cooking oil, eggs, sugar, noodles and soft drinks. She established a small grocery store in her home where she waits on customers in a cordial and friendly manner everyday, starting very early in the morning. The majority of her customers are her neighbors with whom she has a friendly and respectful relationship. Her store has been in operation for 6 months and she generally works alone, although she gets help from her partner occasionally.\r\n\r\nShe likes her grocery store business because it enables her to be at home during the day and participate in her children\u2019s school activities as well as perform household duties. In addition, the earnings she receives help her to pay for basic family expenses.

members, people who have always known each other as they have always lived in the community where they meet. They are hard workers with a desire to succeed. The name of the group was chosen by the members however the meaning is not precisely known, they chose it because it means \"God is here\" and because it is a group that has worked for a long time with the institution.\r\n\r\nAngeles, a member, is 55 years old. She has been married for 39 years to Julio and together they have nine children all of whom all are independent.  Angela, as she is commonly known, is an older woman yet this doesn\u2019t stop her from achieving her dreams. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan from the institution to buy more merchandise such as plastic products and household products. Thirty-five years ago Angela decided to sell these products in markets she says because she wanted to help her husband with household expenses and the education of their children so they could have a better quality of life. The difficulty is not having a stable place where they can offer their products as the authorities prevent them from selling outside the market. \r\n\r\nAngela says that not too long ago they were victims of theft in another state. For Angela\u2019s family it was a scare but she thanks God that the thieves did not hurt any family members, they only took the merchandise but for Angela it was a big scare. In spite of this bad experience, she continued selling her articles because for Angela and Julio the most important thing was the welfare of their children, \"One day I would like to have a stable location where my husband and I could sell our merchandise peacefully as we are already seniors. It\u2019s very difficult to walk in the market offering our products.\u201d \r\n\r\nAngela and the group are very pleased for the loan granted as it will help them invest in their businesses; Albino will invest in pillows, Amelia in household products, Felisa and Hermenegilda will invest in remote controls for televisions, and Sabina in electronic products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6575,"image":{"id":1269672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to sell household products such as vasos, spoons, blender cups, etc..","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin Mextepec, San Felipe del progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T02:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T02:00:01Z","loan_amount":6575,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albino","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Felisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermeregilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":84000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":10500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":821.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":821.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":821.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":821.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2465.63,"local_amount":31500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31501.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284965},{"amount":1643.75,"local_amount":21000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":21001.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199252},{"amount":1643.75,"local_amount":21000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:06:45Z","rounded_local_amount":21001.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596047},{"amount":821.87,"local_amount":10500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10500.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663473}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T20:59:49Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diana Lima","image":830085}},{"id":513899,"name":"Criselda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Criselda, 41, resident of Manila, Philippines.

The members took the name of their group from the bible, and although they don't know exactly what it mean, they like it.  It is an Evangelical name, and the members believe it is the name of a musician.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Raquel is the representative of the group.  She is 35 years old, married to her husband Ismael for 19 years, and together they have a family with three children, two of which are studying.  Do\u00f1a Raquel has sold blenders and household products for 15 years.  She began her business because, as a child, her parents sold these products and then when she got married, her husband Ismael also sold the same products.  It wasn't difficult for her to adapt to the work.  \r\n\r\nThis time Do\u00f1a Raquel is applying for the loan to buy more products such as tongs, spoons, glasses, blenders, etc.  In regards to the loan, Do\u00f1a Raquel said, \"If they authorize this loan for me and my husband, it will be a great help to be able to invest in our business.  The more products we have, the better our sales will be and we will be able to make the quality of life better for our children.\"  The difficulty for Raquel is when sales fall drastically, and this typically happens in the month of February when they don't sell hardly anything.  She would like to have a bigger shop where she can have more merchandise.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Agustina, Emma, Norma, and Felisa who will all invest in household products, and Angelica who will invest in controls devices."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6125,"image":{"id":1203184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy blenders and household products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":6125,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":78000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":765.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":765.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":765.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2296.88,"local_amount":29250,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":29353.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284942},{"amount":1531.25,"local_amount":19500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":19569.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199229},{"amount":1531.25,"local_amount":19500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":19569.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596024},{"amount":765.62,"local_amount":9750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9784.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663448}],"funded_date":"2013-01-14T14:55:15Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carrie Straub","image":null}},{"id":513921,"name":"Marieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marieta is 40 years old, married with five children.

Chhom lives happily with her family in a village of Reussey district, an area of Phnom Penh. To earn a living, she gets involved in three businesses: being a farmer, a waitress \u2014 taking food orders from clients \u2014 and a pig raiser. From each business, she can generate $2.00 a day on average. Aside from her hardships, Chhom is going to help her children in their education.

She has always fought to excel in life. She is in a common-law marriage with Luis, who is a motorcycle mechanic and with whom she has 5 children, who are already grown and independent. She lives in her own house together with her spouse, 2 daughters, and the husband of one of her daughters. What she desires most is to continue working in order to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nEsther\u2019s work entails designing clothing and sewing for other people. Her work is in high demand in her neighborhood, as she is the only one who does this activity. She learned it when she was very young alongside her mother, and later she studied in an occupational education center. Now, she has her own shop, where she serves her customers with great patience. \r\n\r\nShe began with 1 sewing machine more than 44 years ago, and up to now, she has been working alone. She considers her business to be profitable enough, because the demand for her services leaves her with good earnings.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her business, as she can count on a job and economic income. She still remembers when she started out; she had many doubts and difficulties, but through effort and a lot of work, she was able to overcome them. Apart from having this business, she also works renting rooms and business spaces. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to make her business more well-known and to continue growing. In order to do this, she is prepared to keep working. Therefore, this will be her 18th loan with the organization MFP. From her collaboration, she hopes to continue with her goals. In addition, she is very committed to once more paying off her quotas on time and in a responsible way. She feels very comfortable with her communal bank, since her friends from the group are very responsible and always support each other. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 1500 nuevos soles, she will purchase materials to continue with her sewing work, like fabric, thread, buttons, zippers, elastic, and others - looking for low prices on her bulk purchases - in addition to buying materials to repair part of the infrastructure of the rooms that she rents out. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1269783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials to continue with her sewing business, such as fabric, thread, buttons, zippers, elastic, and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T07:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T07:10:14Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":220.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":239.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":248.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":249.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":266.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":274.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.35,"local_amount":220.88,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":225.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573180},{"amount":95.72,"local_amount":239.3,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":243.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122822},{"amount":99.29,"local_amount":248.23,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":253.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868645},{"amount":99.99,"local_amount":249.96,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":254.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577479},{"amount":106.72,"local_amount":266.8,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":272.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529716},{"amount":109.93,"local_amount":274.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":280.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974747}],"funded_date":"2013-01-06T14:07:12Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Hedel","image":971490}},{"id":513941,"name":"Phan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phan, 28, is a married woman with two dependent children.

of her family.  She is 31 years old and is married with two children.  Her husband is not in a position to support the family and for that reason, Hurmat is the main breadwinner of the family.  For more than four years, she has been involved in the purchase and sale of industrial products.  She works in the local market, but lately she has fewer clients and she wants to increase her business.  \r\n\r\nHurmat has been looking for a new business for a few months and thankfully she read an advertisement about the \"Get Ahead\" course offered by the Association of Businesswomen.  She enrolled in the course and received a certificate and now she wants to start a business buying and selling bread.  She will sell bread near her home, as the demand for bread is always high.  With the income from this business, she plans to provide her children with a good education and high-calorie foods.  She is asking for a loan of 7,000 somoni to buy bread to start her business.  She is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1269541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy bread to start her new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T10:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T10:00:01Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hurmat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":738.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":753.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":787.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":819.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":853.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":880.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":900.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":932.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.24},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":155.04,"local_amount":738.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":738.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339741007},{"amount":158.24,"local_amount":753.53,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":753.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056301},{"amount":165.41,"local_amount":787.65,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":787.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801995},{"amount":173.77,"local_amount":827.46,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":827.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510239},{"amount":173.37,"local_amount":825.82,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":826.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915522},{"amount":179.22,"local_amount":853.44,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":853.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693234},{"amount":185,"local_amount":880.99,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":881.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556036},{"amount":189.16,"local_amount":900.76,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":901.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549893},{"amount":195.79,"local_amount":932.05,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":932.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410958865}],"funded_date":"2013-01-06T23:49:12Z","paid_date":"2013-10-21T08:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":513942,"name":"Gataiala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gataiala is a 59-year-old married woman with 11 children.

She works hard to continuously provide for her family's everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nGloria operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGloria hopes to have a continuous good health to help her children and grand children and dreams to have a good future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She is a hardworking woman who really wants to get ahead. She is also kind and cordial. She lives with Elmer, who works as a stevedore. She lives with her father, mother and spouse and their three children, aged 19, 15 and 5. They are her motivation and they live comfortably in their own home that she built on the land her cousin transferred to her. Gloria's activity is selling general groceries from her own house. She opened a small store there where she sells the main basic necessity products such as rice, sugar, pasta, oatmeal and more. \r\n \r\nStarting more than 3 years ago with her spouse's help, whose idea it was, and with her own capital from savings plus a small loan, she was able to buy the first products in small quantities. She was able to grow little by little with a constant rotation of her merchandise.  \r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because of the earnings it brings her and because it is the best stocked store in the area. She likes her business because it allows her to be at home and care for her younger children, whom she loves very much. She also likes her business because of the income it brings in to support her spouse with the household expenses, because many times they didn't have enough to cover their expenses. \r\n \r\nShe plans to continue, expanding the diversity of her products so she will be more preferred by her customers.

She is a hardworking, diligent, happy, and dynamic woman.  She is married to Ciro, who is a farmer.  She lives with her husband and their four and nine year old children who they love very much.  They live comfortably in their own home that was inherited from her parents.  \r\n\r\nTavita works growing regional fruits and vegetables such as pineapples, lemons, oranges, tomatoes, and others.  She also sells fresh fruit at a stall at her local market.  She has done this work for more than 12 years.  She has the support of her husband and two laborers to plant, harvest, and care for the products she takes to sell at the market.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because of the good income she earns, since there is a large demand for organic fruit in the city.  She likes her work because she is used to doing it since she learned from her parents.  Also, the income she earns allows them to pay their household expenses and for their children's education.  On the other hand, she does not like the physical fatigue that comes with a long day of work, so she takes breaks up to two days and returns to her business.  She also hopes to earn more income by diversifying what she plants.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP.  She is happy with the opportunity to count on a line of credit to advance her business.  She also likes her community bank because the other members are kind and responsible.  With the requested loan of 1000 nuevos soles, she will pay her laborers for cultivating her land and harvesting her products such as lemons, pineapples, mandarin oranges, and others to later transport them to the market and sell them.  This is where she makes the most money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1269836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay laborers to cultivate her land and harvest her crops such as lemons, pineapple, mandarin oranges, and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tavita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":149.65},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":171.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":183.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.36,"local_amount":150.9,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":153.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573190},{"amount":59.86,"local_amount":149.65,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":152.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122832},{"amount":66.02,"local_amount":165.04,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":168.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868655},{"amount":68.78,"local_amount":171.95,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":175.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577489},{"amount":71.66,"local_amount":179.16,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":182.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529726},{"amount":73.32,"local_amount":183.3,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":186.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974757}],"funded_date":"2013-01-04T17:29:29Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":513967,"name":"Purevsuren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Purevsuren, 64 years old, lives with her husband, her daughter and her niece in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

The family resides in an apartment. As winter comes to Mongolia, it becomes difficult to go to work without his own automobile because they live in a quite remote place. Also, picking up his children from school and driving his wife to work become necessary as night comes earlier in the winter time. So, he is requesting a loan of 6800000 MNT to purchase an automobile which runs on natural gas. As a result, he can drive his wife to work and sons to kindergarten. Most importantly, an automobile which runs on natural gas emits less smoke thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

He is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who has a great desire to succeed. Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and the need to work, Miguel was unable to study for a professional career. He would have liked to have done so. In his spare time he enjoys listening to music and occasionally cooks a delicious \u201carroz con pollo\u201d to share with his family.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative and with a great deal of effort and dedication, Miquel works at his business cultivating onions. In addition he works as a field laborer on an estate in the city on weekends. He works every day from very early in the morning and puts in approximately 8 hours. He feels things are going well for him because of his good performance and friendly treatment of others.\r\n\r\nMiguel is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to cover  the costs of irrigating, fertilizing and maintaining his fields. Thus he will be able to continue working to achieve his great dream, which is to have his own house\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1269869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to cover the costs of irrigating, fertilizing and maintaining his fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T16:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T16:50:01Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Clemente ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3058.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889062}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T13:17:50Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:32:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":513996,"name":"Ruphus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruphus is 52 years old, married to Alfred and they have been blessed with six children, ages 28, 27, 22, 21,19 and 18.

For more than 15 years, Inobat engaged in raising livestock with her husband, but year after year her two children require more benefits. Their income from livestock no longer meets the family budget. \r\n\r\nFor several months already, Inobat has been planning to establish her own business sewing women's clothing. She is a skillful dressmaker and sews beautiful women's clothing. Finally, she learned of a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and took this course and received a certificate. \r\n\r\nNow, she can fully start a business and become successful in this field. From the revenue, she plans to provide her children with a good education and high-calorie food. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 10,000 Somoni to buy a sewing machine and fabric to establish a new business. She is awaiting your

He makes 300 Laris total per month. It is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMerab requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start credits with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received loan, Merab will purchase plumbing equipment. After purchasing the equipment, he will be able to work as a plumber, will get orders and thus increase monthly income of the family.

She always tries to realize her plans and to receive their benefits. She is married and is raising two young children. Her husband does not provide for the family and therefore Firuza is the main breadwinner in the family. For more than 15 years, she has been engaged in growing crops and vegetables, and viticulture. The last time she did not get the intended crop and could not earn enough money to live, and therefore difficult living conditions force her to work more and more. \r\n\r\nThe only way to generate additional income and to improve living conditions is to create a new business, says Firuza. To that end, she took a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate. \r\n\r\nNow, she can fully organize a business and become successful in this area. She wants to organize a business buying and selling livestock, since she lives in a rural area and has good conditions for livestock. From the revenue, she plans to buy all the needed means for living. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 2,000 Somoni to buy cattle to establish a new business.

capital city of Mongolia.  She works as a decorator at a private company. Her husband earns income by using his truck to transport goods. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. The house they live in needs some home appliances. Also, the truck her husband uses has deteriorated over the years and needs some repair. As winter comes to Mongolia, the house gets cold and the family is in need of some heating source.

With the loan, Natia will purchase calves and feed for them. She will raise them and sell them after several months.

He also works in agriculture, specifically farming cotton and grapes, among others.  Due to scarce economic resources, he was only able to study in primary school, though he would have liked to get a degree in education.  \r\n\r\nDay-to-day, Wilfredo works as a longshoreman, working around 8 hours a day.  With the fruits of his labor, he helps his parents with household expenses.  He believes his work is going well because he is very responsible and above all, honest.  \r\n\r\nWilfredo is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to their support, he will be able to buy a refrigerator for his parents.  They currently cook over a wood fire, and this improvement will avoid accidents and improve his family's quality of life.

He is married to 60 year old Sarela, with whom he shares his home, which he built on land that he and his wife bought together.  He is a father of one adult daughter who he educated and raised.  He currently lives with his wife, his daughter and her husband, and one grandson.  They all contribute toward the household expenses.\r\n\r\nJose sells cold carbonated soft drinks of different brands and flavors.  He also sells various types of snacks.  To do this he has a small shop that he set up in his home.  Having seen his neighbors\u2019 and transients\u2019 needs, he looked for a way to generate an income, so he opened this shop where his wife happily serves customers.\r\n\r\nHe also provides transportation services with his car.\r\n\r\nHe began his selling business more than a year ago, became known among his neighbors, and won regular customers. \r\n\r\nHe considers his business to be profitable because he has steady customers who always buy from him.\r\n\r\nHe likes what he does because it lets him count on an income and also leaves him time to do transportation, which generates other income with which he supports his wife and other household expenses.  Therefore he plans to increase his stock of products and diversify so he can welcome more customers.  This will be his sixth loan through MFP and he is very happy to know that he will have financial backing and feels more comfortable advancing with his work. He also promises to be on time with his payments as with previous loans.  He is also happy to be part of his communal bank because all the members are responsible and united.\r\n\r\nHe will use the 2,000 PEN from this loan to buy carbonated drinks and snacks.  He is looking for volume prices so he can be more competitive in prices and have better sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1269780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":294.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":318.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":330.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":332.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":355.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":367.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.71},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.71,"local_amount":294.27,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":300.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573178},{"amount":127.52,"local_amount":318.81,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":325.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122820},{"amount":132.28,"local_amount":330.7,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":337.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868643},{"amount":133.2,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":339.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577477},{"amount":142.18,"local_amount":355.45,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":362.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529714},{"amount":147.11,"local_amount":367.78,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":374.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974745}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T19:30:02Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She believes that her business is doing well because she is friendly to her customers and eager to get ahead.\r\n\r\nVilma is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support they have given her, she can buy new display cases  and wood to renovate  her tricycle so she can continue selling her product. This way, she can have the necessary equipment to work and above all to continue striving for her greatest dream: to finish her degree and own a home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1270388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy display cases, wood, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-01-04T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-03T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":69.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":51.31,"processed_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":53.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339479047},{"amount":22.16,"local_amount":54.54,"processed_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":56.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031722},{"amount":24.24,"local_amount":59.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":61.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776211},{"amount":24.1,"local_amount":59.31,"processed_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":61.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483024},{"amount":25.42,"local_amount":62.57,"processed_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":64.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889070},{"amount":26.16,"local_amount":64.4,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":66.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381663986},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":67.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":70.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775002},{"amount":28.41,"local_amount":69.92,"processed_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":72.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778767},{"amount":126.17,"local_amount":310.58,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":321.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054003}],"funded_date":"2013-01-06T17:55:45Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:14:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"LeeJay Victor","image":null}},{"id":514169,"name":"Hermelinda Facunda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hermelinda vive en la ciudad de Ica, es madre soltera y saca delante con mucho esfuerzo y sobre todo cari\u00f1o a sus 3 hijos, quienes para ella on lo mejor que le ha brindado Dios y son su razon y su motor para vivir.

\n","en":"Soledad, 20, is single and lives in the city of Ica with her parents and siblings.  She's a very friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic young woman with a big desire for self-improvement.  Unfortunately, because she lacks financial resources and needs to work, Soledad hasn't been able to study to be a nurse as she would like, but she would very much like to do so.  In her free time she likes to watch movies, and sometimes she cooks a delicious ceviche to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with great effort and dedication, Soledad works every day as a domestic employee.  She cleans, cooks, washes clothes, and does other tasks.  Soledad can work approximately eight hours, and she believes it's going well for her because of her responsibility and honesty.\r\n\r\nSoledad is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she'll be able to buy panettone and toys.  With the Christmas season approaching, she wants to start a small business.  This way she'll be able to continue working and making the effort so that in the near future she can realize her dream of having her own clothing boutique.\r\n

One source of income is his monthly salary working as a watchman, additionally he is provided with a retirement pension. \r\n\r\nGogia is requesting a loan from Credo to start-up his family business. He will use his loan to purchase piglets to start an animal husbandry business. He will put the piglets in a shed in the yard and raise and sell them for a higher price. Gogia's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

There she earns income by selling merchandise in a general store or business located in her own house. Her main products are clothing, shoes, cosmetics, and stationery, which she sells on a cash basis to customers from the neighborhood and surrounding areas every day starting at 9 in the morning and ending at 9 in the evening or later, if necessary. The idea of selling merchandise initially came to Sandra 8 years ago, and because of this she chose to join up with a multinational company to sell its products through catalogues or specialized product guides. Little by little she bought display cases with her earnings, and then her own premises, in which she can still be found and from which she distributes her products in cash to the end customer who buys it at retail. Lately she has been offering communication services by the minute, which generates new income. In this way she makes the most of her land line customers with the goal of boosting both businesses. Her goal is to achieve a wide variety of products and find a new place of business or branch with this same concept. Her capacity to buy in order to satisfy the growing demand is getting smaller and smaller, but her desire to grow is persistent.
