She's a married woman who has five children, ages 19 to 32, and makes a living selling merchandise in a shop and selling chicken and cold cuts.\r\n\r\nHer experience as a merchant dates back five years, when she began selling cosmetics through specialized product catalogues in 2007.  Little by little she bought display cabinets to fix up her point of contact with her customers.  Here they found many of the articles they needed, such as clothing, women's accessories, and general jewelry.  This way she increased her clientele and later added sales of chicken and cold cuts, making the most of the customers she had acquired during this period.\r\n\r\nShe makes sales in cash and, among her better customers, on credit.  She works Monday through Sunday from 8 in the morning until 10 at night, with the goal of getting more well-being in her household all the time.  Her commercial business is located in her house, and all the people around her know her, so she has more buyers all the time.\r\n\r\nThis is why she's requesting a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She'll buy cosmetics, chicken, meat, etc.\r\n\r\nWith this investment, little by little she'll earn a new market and increase her investments again, especially in the Christmas season, when an increase in sales is normal every year.

She set up a small convenience store in her home offering general groceries, taking advantage that there had not been any such business in the community and the inhabitants had to travel to El Sauce to acquire their household necessities. Her sales have increased during this time of nice January weather, and she needs more capital to stock her business. She is requesting the loan to purchase milk, vegetables, rice, sugar, bread, oil and toilet paper. She is asking Kiva and CEPRODEL to support this request so she can stock up on the products her customers demand and thus satisfy them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1270455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She recently bought plastic chairs that are rented for small functions with the help of the loan from UGAFODE the previous cycle. She hopes to buy many more chairs so that she can earn more from them. \n\nShe wants the loan to buy maize seeds and hire labourers for planting them during this time when it is raining. She encourages fellow women to be innovative and not to under look their potential because all things are possible. Phillip, another group member, makes mats out of papyrus. His main challenge is the cold weather which prevents them from drying and in turn produces poor quality mats. He hopes to diversify to agriculture if he gets funds.

Running this business comes with its own challenges, like working capital. Richard spends his days running to and from the bank to convert the money he has from cash to electronic and vise-versa, so that he can serve his customers.

Seven years ago, he decided to venture into motorcycle transport to help meet the family's needs, given its low cost of operation.

The women themselves chose this name for the group because the area where they live has some of the best sand you can ever find.  One member of the group, Isabel, tells us that she is 32 years old and has been married to Abranm, a trader, for 32 years.  Together, they had a family but now their children are independent.  Isabel has always lived in the same community and for 20 years she has been selling household products.  She started this because as a child she always saw her parents and neighbours that would sell at the markets and then, when she married, she wanted to help her husband with the household bills.  Her daughters studied and she wanted the best for them.  Isabel is applying for a loan in order to buy more merchandise, such as strainers, blender cups, items for pressure cookers, spoons, cloths and floor cloths.  Isabel is very happy because, thanks to the loan from Kiva and Vision Found, she will be able to buy everything she needs.  She says that she has always walked the streets to sell her products.  She thinks that she does not have any difficulties because she is reliable in what she does in case they stop her from selling in peace.  Perhaps her sales are low though she says:  \"One day I would like to have my own place where we could sell our products.  I think our profits would increase so much because customers would know where to find us much more easily and we would sell more\".  All the members of the group also have dreams and so they are all applying for a loan.  Zenaida will use hers to buy novelty items; Rosa will buy blender cups and household products; Veronica will invest in items for Christmas; Gloria will buy socks and blender cups; Rosa Ma will buy fibres and household products; and, finally, Alicia will buy for her grocery store.

It comprises eight members and has an executive board, with Magari as president. The members of the group are engaged in various activities, among them lace weaving, dress sales, dressmaking, grocery shop, plaid weaving, vegetable sales. This loan will thus benefit a group of very small entrepreneurs. Magari tells us that she has been working with Pro Mujer for one year. She got to know this field partner thanks to a spokesperson who came to visit her at her house. Magari makes and sells skirts. She learned at a school and then decided to start her own small business. She wants to take out a loan in order to increase her working capital and buy cloth at the markets of the town of El Alto, at a very good price. Afterwards, she will be able to sell her wares near the border between Bolivia and Peru. The income Magari derives from her business enables her to help with household expenses, since she is married and has two children. When asked what she likes about working with Pro Mujer, she talks about the training received on topics such as health and credit

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

daughters. Osama lives a modest life with his family in the Jabalia area located in Gaza City. He is employed, but earns a low salary which is not enough to cover all of his costs and provide for his family's needs.\r\n\r\nOsama has also been a taxi driver for the past three months. He wants to have his own taxi in order to work on his own project. It is a step to increase his income and provide his family with better living conditions.\r\n\r\nOsama is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to purchase his own taxi. This will help Osama to feel free to work extra hours and take more internal and external requests, which will lead to an increase in his income and better living conditions for his family.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her husband no longer works due to poor health.\r\n\r\nMaria, upon seeing that her husband could no longer work, used the savings she had to open a small general store in her own home. She and her husband attend it every day, though they recognize that the days when they sell the most are the weekends, days when many tourists arrive to this beautiful resort area. Here they sell a little of everything, from clothing and shoes to ice cream, sodas, ice, and many other products that her customers need. The business is now 5 years old and it is now the only source of income they have for getting ahead.\r\n\r\nMaria is again requesting a loan from Kiva because these loans help her greatly. With the earnings from this loan cycle, she can purchase a glass case that will serve to exhibit her merchandise, facilitating sales, since customers from outside her house will see what they like and enter to buy. \r\n\r\nConcerning repayment, she has always been reliable. This loan will be used to restock the general store, purchasing clothing, shoes, wallets, etc. Maria has been a member of her communal bank for more than 14 years and she likes it for the benefits the institution offers. Maria's goals are to continue ahead in her business and to enjoy good health.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1166133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She sells fresh fruits by getting up early and heading to the local markets where she buys the freshest fruits from the vendors and brings them back to her store to sell to her customers, who for the most part are her own neighbors. She has been running her business for three years, during which time she has attended to her customers in a kind and cordial manner, thereby winning their business. At present, she runs this business all by herself.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be quite successful given the strong demand she has for her products and the income it brings her. She likes her business because it allows her to be at home, allows her to be around her children so she can care for them, and provides her with an occupation that generates an income. This allows her to help her husband with their home expenses and the education of their children. Seeing the good results she has had with her business, she has plans to continue and to expand, acquiring more merchandise to stock her store. Thus, she is applying for her third loan through the institution, MFP. She is grateful that she can count on the financial assistance to continue with her goals. She promises to make timely payments so that she can maintain a strong credit history and be able to secure more loans in the future. She also comments that she is happy with her communal bank; she knows the other members and considers them to be good people. \r\n\r\nWith the amount of 800 nuevos soles requested, she will invest in more merchandise to stock her store: primary staples such as rice, canned goods, noodles, and other foodstuffs. She will purchase these wholesale so as to increase her profit margins."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1269803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more goods to stock her store with staple items such as rice, canned goods, noodles, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-06T01:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-05T01:20:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ybette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":131.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":137.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":143.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":147.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.02,"local_amount":120.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":124.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573185},{"amount":48.61,"local_amount":119.65,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":123.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122827},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":131.95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":136.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868650},{"amount":55.85,"local_amount":137.48,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":142.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577484},{"amount":58.2,"local_amount":143.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":148.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529721},{"amount":59.72,"local_amount":147.01,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":152.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974752}],"funded_date":"2013-01-09T02:51:53Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JOHN NELSON","image":634031}},{"id":514322,"name":"Candelaria Aida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Artesanal se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en el Cant\u00f3n Jipijapa, cant\u00f3n conocido con el nombre de la sultana del caf\u00e9 por los extensos cultivos de caf\u00e9 el cual tiene un sabor incomparable, por su gastronom\u00eda y por la calidez de su gente. \n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Candelaria, tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 separada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen cuatro hijos todos mayores de edad, dos de ellos aun viven con ella.

With much effort, Anny managed to study for a career in law, but because she did not find employment appropriate to her profession, and after a great search for employment, she began work in the city municipality. She works about 8 hours a day, and she feels that her work is going well for her because she is very responsible and above all because she wants to advance.\r\n\r\nAnny is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help offered to her, she will be able to make improvements in her home, since there are some cracks, and she will be able to mend the roof.

they love above all else. He is a very nice, hard-working, and enthusiastic person, who spares no effort to try to improve his family's lot in life. Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources that made it necessary for him to start working, Marcial was not able to study mechanical engineering, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to watch television and sometimes cooks delicious pasta to share with his family. Marcial, with lots of effort and dedication, started his own business selling emollients. On week-ends, he works as a mototaxi driver. He starts work early every morning and works about eight hours a day.

Bilguun, 27 years old, lives with his family in Darkhan, the second-largest city of Mongolia. Since 2008, he has been working at a steel mill. He began as a coal heaver, and then advanced his career by becoming an assistant, an operator, and now a shift foreman. His wife is an elementary school teacher, but now stays at home with their infant child, who is one year old. Their first son, four years old, goes to kindergarten. Bilguun's mother is retired from work and lives with them. \r\n\r\nThe family resides in their own house on a plot of land. As winter comes to Mongolia, the family is in urgent need of an insulated house -- if not, the mother and baby will be frozen to their core and may get sick. So Bilguun is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase construction materials such as bricks, foam, fiberglass and cement. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the construction, the family will be able to live in a comfortable and warm place. At the same time, the borrower will be able to work without worrying about the well-being of his wife and children. Most importantly, an insulated house can conserve energy and keep its warmth, and it will reduce the consumption of coal, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

Nyamjargal, 34 years old, lives with his wife and son in Darkhan, the second-largest city of Mongolia. He has been working as a coal preparer in a steel mill for three years. Before working in Darkhan, he worked in a coal mine. His wife works as a seller in a local supermarket. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Their son goes to kindergarten. \r\n\r\nAs winter comes to Mongolia, the badly damaged house they live in becomes vulnerable to storms and frost. So they decided to insulate the house, as well as do some interior repairs. In order to make it happen, they are requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase construction materials, such as bricks, foam, fiberglass and cement. \r\n\r\nInsulating their house will decrease the family's coal usage, contributing to environmental protection by reducing smoke emissions. Nyamjargal is a very hard-working individual, who strives for a better life, together with his family.

She is married to Ricardo, a driver, and is a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business.\r\nAt this time, she and her husband are working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\nMamerta owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one (14-16 person) jeepney. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1000 every day.\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for maintenance of her jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\nMamerta dreams of having more jeepneys and hopes to always be happy. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

Bujigmaa, 47 years old, lives with her family in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia. Her son provides taxi services to local people by using his own car. One of her twin daughters has been working as a specialist at a supermarket since 2009, and other one runs her own business. Her daughter-in-law sells clothes at an outdoor market. She herself has been working as a doorkeeper at an electricity and heating station since 2004. Her two grandchildren go to kindergarten. \n\nThis extended family resides in their house on a plot of land surrounded with fences. The fences are built with planks. As winter come to Mongolia, strong storms may break down the fences. Additionally, wooden planks are prone to fire, whether accidental or on purpose. They also deteriorate over the years. So they have decided to replace the planks with blocks in order to strengthen the fences. Advantages of block fences are an invulnerability to fire and the ability to keep the family warm by blocking the winds. People with wooden fences repair them by simply cutting forest trees. In order to protect the forest, block fences are encouraged everywhere. Mrs. Bujigmaa is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to purchase blocks. As a result the family can live in a safe place without the fire hazard of wooden fences.

She is married to Roger, who is her business partner, and she is a mother to her children. She and her husband manage their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnalie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community members. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Analie is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnalie hopes that her business will continue to grow and that her family will be happier. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1271453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They belong to a non-tribal community and live at the outskirts of Imphal East in a small village in Manipur state located in the North Eastern part of India. Taxi service is available but it takes about one hour drive to reach the place.\r\n\r\nChaoba is the profiled member pictured with raised hand. She is 40 years old and she is a mother to two sons and two daughters. Her husband is a hired lorry driver and the main earner of the family. Her three older children are school drop-outs and now her youngest daughter aged 14 years is the only member of the family going to school. Chaoba is determined to provide to her youngest daughter everything that she failed to give the older children. She is happy that every member of the family, too, supports the youngest daughter with the necessary requirements for her schooling. \r\n\r\nIn order to supplement the family income, before the loans Chaoba used to earn money on anything that came her way. She even worked as a lorry labourer doing work such as loading and unloading sand and grindstones from the truck. In 2010, she joined the group to access loans and start a business activity of her own.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she purchased 10 bags of unhulled rice and paid INR 450 per bag weighing 40 kilogram each. She would then process the rice at a rice mill to separate the husk from the grain and sell it for a profit. With the second loan, she was able to expand her business with better profit earning. Her elder son helps her with the business. Apart from meeting the loan liability, she managed to save around INR 500 on a monthly basis together with a savings group of 30 members.\r\n\r\nShe plans to purchase a sewing machine for her other daughter to enhance her embroidery art and also wishes to own one of those rice mills down the road for future income opportunity. For this she means to save as much as she can with the help of her family members.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan now to continue with her rice-selling business. With limited capital she was not in a position to do the business on large scale. She will use the loan to buy unhulled rice and stock it to sell when rice is in demand for a higher profit.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too need a loan to continue and improve upon their respective income-generating activities. Vegetable vending, sand sieving (quarrying), poultry farming, and grocery store business are some of the activities that the members are engaged in.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1271506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy bags of paddy rice, extract the grain from the husk, and sell it for a profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-07T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-06T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chaoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binashakhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibemcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bembem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memtonbi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tamphasana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandhyarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T13:15:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":514639,"name":"Ruth Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2010 these 12 Tribal women created a platform for themselves and formed a group called Ruth.

matured. Working with surrounding El Paso business owners to produce positive results, the Hispanic entrepreneurship instructor, business coach, CEO and founder of Ascend: Entrepreneurial Growth says the recipe for a good business is a good theory and process. This year, Hector Homero refined his process leading to business maturity. \n\n\u201cThis year, I\u2019ve nailed that down better and have seen results,\u201d he says, defining theory as the idea and the value of business structure, which differs between entrepreneurs. \u201cI see the results clearer and more predictable now than last year,\u201d he says. Hector Homero added he\u2019s also learned, when focusing on the structure of the business, he can help an entrepreneur find the root of an issue then produce a quick solution. Hector Homero says he of course wants to guide his clients \u201cthrough the long haul,\u201d but his clientele doesn\u2019t always stay past the beginning stages.\n\nIn his last interview, Hector Homero stated, \u201c89 percent of small business owners in Texas are sole proprietors,\u201d leaving them with 100 percent of the job obligations.  This statistic still holds true. As a sole proprietor himself, Hector Homero says he needs to improve his business before hiring, though he needs help now. \u201cThe idea is to grow,\u201d he says. \u201cBusiness growth is economic growth to the community,\u201d however, it is a challenge to obtain, he says. Currently, Hector Homero offers one-on-one sessions which he then merges into round-table learning sessions he says helps clients network. \n\nThis is Hector Homero\u2019s third loan with micro-lender Accion Texas. He says, \u201cAccion has helped me make the next step, it\u2019s not a big one, but it\u2019s one I need. I like Accion a lot. What I\u2019m trying to do now, what I would like to be able to do, is get my business to pay off this loan and strategize a larger loan to get my business to the next level. Accion has become a part of my growth plan.\u201d\n\nHis latest loan is to market his business and update software. Hector Homero purchased a Nuance program called Dragon Naturally Speaking, which transcribes voice to text and helps him cut the hour of work he normally takes to manually transcribe every meeting\u2019s notes and track a client\u2019s progress. \u201cEverything I do now is the hard way; I need to be more efficient,\u201d he says. \u201cI need to work on my web page to where it works for me.\u201d Hector Homero says to better his site, it would take the creation of more resources and a newsletter to draw people to the site.\n\nTo find out more about Hector Homero and his business, visit his website at: http:\/\/www.ascendeg.com.

She lives in Beit Hanoun, Jabalia with her husband. Iman's husband is employed, with a very low wage. They want to improve their home by buying some necessary furniture such as living room furniture. \r\n\r\nEman took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to buy new living room furniture. This loan will help Eman and her husband to enjoy living in their house and improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She\u2019s aware that she does not have the necessary resources to make said purchase which is why she\u2019s requesting a loan.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1269143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Itagui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-01-07T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-06T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":38247},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":39310},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40403},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":41526},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":42681},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43868},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45087},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":46341},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":47629},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":48953},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50314},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":51713},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":53151},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":54629},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56148}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.77},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.86,"local_amount":38247,"processed_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":38629.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548901},{"amount":23.06,"local_amount":40349,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:51:05Z","rounded_local_amount":40752.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098773},{"amount":24.31,"local_amount":42546,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":42971.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517956},{"amount":24.38,"local_amount":42673,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":43099.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364552183},{"amount":24.55,"local_amount":42958,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":43387.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373513889},{"amount":25.3,"local_amount":44268,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":44710.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382164533},{"amount":26.03,"local_amount":45549,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":46004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390981547},{"amount":26.06,"local_amount":45597,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":46052.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400821433},{"amount":28.29,"local_amount":49513,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50008.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410806501},{"amount":176.16,"local_amount":308300,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":311383.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420094639}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T01:52:38Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:14:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}}]}
