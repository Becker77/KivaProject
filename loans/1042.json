These women live in a community where people in addition to growing corn also work in commerce; it\u2019s a small, very tranquil place.  The name of the group was chosen because when they joined together one of the members had a children\u2019s musical group called \u201cRayito de Sol.\u201d\r\n\r\nElena, 40, who is a member of this group, relates that she\u2019s been married to Israel for 20 years; they have formed a family and have two children attending school.  Elena has been selling blender jars and cleaning supplies for 20 years having started her activity when she married her husband, Israel.  Elena commented: \u201cI started selling these items because I wanted to somehow help my husband with household expenses, especially for my children, so they would have a better quality of life and a good education.\u201d\r\n\r\nElena has always enjoyed selling her products because when she does well she\u2019s able to buy food, clothes and shoes for her children.  The only difficulty is when the authorities in charge prevent them from going outside the market to sell their wares because this affects their profits.

They belong to a non-tribal community and live in a small village on the outskirts of the Imphal East district in Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. This part of the state is famous for brewing local wine and the flavor can closely be associated with that of Tequila and Vodka.\r\n\r\nMemcha is the profiled member pictured with her hand raised. She studied up to class VIII. Now she is 51 years old and is a mother to a daughter and two sons who are already in their late 30\u2019s. All her children are school dropouts due to the poor conditions of the family.  Her husband is a farmer by profession and is a daily wage earner. In order to supplement the family income, she has been running a pickle store with a small budget to earn income. Due to insufficient capital, she can never upgrade her store with other products to sell other than a few eatables and self-made pickles.  \r\n\r\nIn 2010, with her first loan, she bought stocks to sell for profits. She used the loan to stock grocery items to sell such as onions, tomatoes, dal, cooking oil, fermented fish, sugar, milk and varieties of eatables. Her wish to expand her store business was fulfilled, for which she is ever grateful. With the sale of the store stocks, she collected larger profits that she used wisely. With her second loan too, she bought store stock to sell. With the saved profits, she renovated her store by making proper shelves to stack the items. Apart from the loan liability, she was able to save as much as INR 700 per month by way of local savings with 25 other members, where the total money collected monthly is utilized on a rotating basis.\r\n  \r\nSince her children are coming of age, she wishes to build and provide a good house for them. She also plans to purchase a paddy field for the family's sustainability, where she can keep her two sons engaged and busy with something useful. With the expansion of her store business, she let her daughter manage the store while she helped her two sons with their quarrying activities to increase their income.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan to continue with her general store business. She will use the loan to stock fresh products to sell at her store. With steady improvement and with the loan, she is making progress towards expanding her store. Likewise, the rest of the group members too wish to do better with their respective income-generating activities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1271524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy fresh stock to sell at her store ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-01-07T23:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-06T23:00:15Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Memcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrabi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Senubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sorojini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rojita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T16:41:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":513846,"name":"Jose Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jose es un joven que vive en la calida ciudad de Chincha, la cual no solo se caracteriza por su clima caluroso sino tambien por ser la cuna de grandes glorias del deporte peruano, asimimo sus pobladores tiene un don especial para la preparacion de alimentos ya que lo hacen de manera deliciosa.

They wanted the name of a flower or a plant; however in the midst of joking around the name \u201caroma\u201d occurred to a man who is no longer a group member.\r\n\r\nMagdalena is a group member.  She relates that she\u2019s 52-years-old and married to Apolinar for the last 34 years.  They formed a family with children but they are all grown now and living independently from this couple.  Do\u00f1a Elena, as she\u2019s affectionately called, relates that she\u2019s been selling all types of clothes for the last 8 years but on this occasion is asking for a loan to only buy clothes for babies.  She relates that she started her activity because one of her children sold records but then changed over to selling clothes and Do\u00f1a Elena decided to also sell clothes.  She sells only on Mondays in one of the state\u2019s municipalities.  She\u2019s very happy and grateful for the loan that the institution is granting her because thanks to the loan she\u2019ll be able to buy more baby clothes for her little stand and will be able to expand and her profits will grow.  Do\u00f1a Elena commented: \u201cFor me it\u2019s better to have a wide variety of clothes to offer my customers who then happily return to buy more clothes for their entire family from me.\u201d  \r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas season, Elena always has problems with her stand because during this season the authorities in charge of assigning the stands give preference to those merchants selling Christmas items like sets of lights, trees, tree decorations, etc. and often she\u2019s left without a stand during this season.  Elena\u2019s goal is to someday have a stand where she can sell her clothes and not have to be going through this time after time.\r\n\r\nThe group members are Adela who will buy corn to make tortillas and a scale, Linares and Alejandra who will buy chickens, Teresa will buy pigs, Lourdes and Adriana will buy sheep, Agripina will sell backpacks, Laura and Mar\u00eda Maura will buy chickens and turkeys.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6200,"image":{"id":1261386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy baby clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dolores Hidalgo, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-07T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-06T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":6200,"lender_count":137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Maura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linares","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":79000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":9875},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":9875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1937.5,"local_amount":24687.5,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":24760.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284940},{"amount":1550,"local_amount":19750,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":19808.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199227},{"amount":1550,"local_amount":19750,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19808.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596022},{"amount":1162.5,"local_amount":14812.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":14856.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663446}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T15:18:15Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":514411,"name":"Leonid","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434 -

Jhosep will use the money to buy several cans of pumpkin seeds as well as natural fertilizer to spread among his crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1271675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pumpkin seeds and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhosep ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":328.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":340.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":361.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":363.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":383.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":393.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":407.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":422.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.18,"local_amount":407.95,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":416.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573192},{"amount":130.88,"local_amount":327.19,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":333.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122837},{"amount":117.87,"local_amount":294.69,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":300.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868659},{"amount":145.44,"local_amount":363.59,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":370.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577495},{"amount":153.22,"local_amount":383.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":390.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529730},{"amount":157.28,"local_amount":393.2,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":401.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974762},{"amount":163.02,"local_amount":407.55,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":415.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996068},{"amount":169.11,"local_amount":422.78,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":431.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863691}],"funded_date":"2013-01-11T00:21:54Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":514869,"name":"Marlaine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlaine is 30 years old and married with 7 children.

Her parents helped her with everything.  \r\n\r\nFor a few years now, Zaynura has been working as a teacher at the local high school.

However, Zaynura knows how to weave carpets, a craft she learned from her grandmother.  Her plan is to turn this craft into a business, and to make some money out of it.\r\n\r\nWith this goal in mind, Zaynura has taken a course entitled \"Achieving success\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and she has earned a certificate.

She lives with her children, whom she cares for in her own house. Adela is an independent woman, since she cares for her children alone. Her principal endeavor is rewarded by growing basic products such as corn and potatoes, which she plants with great care, and she constantly cleans out the weeds that grow between the furrows. On the other hand, what bothers her are the pests that arrive in her fields as a result of the cold location. She furthermore comments that thanks to the good management of her fields, she can counteract the problems caused by these dangerous bacteria. Thanks to this, she obtains good earnings with the harvest of her crops. Now she wants to improve the quality of their feeding to be able to receive a more equitable price for her crops. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP, where she feels that she has progressed and is happy, since she hopes to obtain the loan to continue with her goals. Furthermore, she promises to make her payments punctually, since she is a responsible and loyal person. Adela will invest the money she has applied for in the purchase of organic compost to scatter among her plantings of corn, which she will soon harvest.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1271688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":151.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":176.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":179.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":191.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":198.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":205.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":211.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.62,"local_amount":151.55,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":154.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122839},{"amount":70.52,"local_amount":176.31,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":179.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868661},{"amount":71.73,"local_amount":179.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":182.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577497},{"amount":74.26,"local_amount":185.64,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":189.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529732},{"amount":76.49,"local_amount":191.24,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":195.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974764},{"amount":79.58,"local_amount":198.94,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":202.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996070},{"amount":166.8,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:10Z","rounded_local_amount":425.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863693}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T08:27:32Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":514894,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In addition to farming, Wilson engages in a retailing business selling drinks, breads and spices.

She is married to Levi, a vendor, and is a mother to her children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a direct-selling business. At this time, she and her husband are working hard to earn income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNenita sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk and Marikina Shoe Exchange. The dealer pays for a customer\u2019s order in cash and gives the customer one month to pay. The prices for dealers are lower than those in the catalogues, which customers pay. It\u2019s the difference between the two that the dealers earn as income. \r\n\r\nNenita\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and members of her local community. She earns a minimum 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week. To help her continue operating of her business, she is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP to buy additional supplies and merchandise needed for her business, such as shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, and undergarments. She expects to boost her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNenita hopes to expand her business and have a canteen. She also dreams of having her own house for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God.*\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet weekly. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1271929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional supplies and merchandise needed for her business, such as shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, and undergarments.

She lives with Francisco, who is 32, with whom she has a little daughter named Mayte, who is only 5 years old and to whom she wants to offer a better quality of life. She lives in her own house, which she built with the help of her partner. She lives there with her family, and each of its members takes a part in moving forward. \r\n\r\nCindy's work consists of selling articles of clothing exclusively for children. Every day she goes to the homes of her friends, neighbors, and relatives to offer all the products that she has for sale. She doesn't hesitate for a moment to knock on each of their doors and convince them to acquire some item. The clothing that she offers is of different sizes and in various styles and colors. In general she sells on credit while only in some cases can she sell for cash. She has been doing this work for three years. She works alone, either in her home or in the homes of her various customers. She likes her work a lot, since it allows her to have time to spend with her family. Furthermore, it allows her to help with the household finances. She wants to continue working and begin to expand her business, also selling shoes for children, but for now she is concentrating only on keeping her place in the market and in the future expanding her little business. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan from MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support, since this way she feels more certain of advancing in her work. Similarly, she promises once again to make her payments punctually, as she did with her past loans. She is satisfied with being a member of her communal bank, since all the members are very responsible and united. With the amount she has applied for (1800 PEN), she will buy a larger quantity of merchandise, consisting of articles of clothing and some shoes of different styles.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1271700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a greater quantity of merchandise, consisting of articles of clothing and some shoes in different styles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T03:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T03:20:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cindy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":274.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":272.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":297.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":308.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":319.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":327.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.69},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.5,"local_amount":274.34,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":281.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573193},{"amount":109.76,"local_amount":272.51,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":279.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122840},{"amount":119.69,"local_amount":297.17,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":305.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868662},{"amount":124.16,"local_amount":308.25,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":316.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577498},{"amount":128.79,"local_amount":319.75,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":328.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529733},{"amount":132.1,"local_amount":327.98,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":336.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974765}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T08:52:53Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":514885,"name":"Ferolini","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ferolini is 27 years old and in a \u201cde-facto\u201d relationship with three children.

hijos que son independientes pero que sin embargo les ayuda cuando requieren su apoyo. Vive solo y aunque a veces esto le cause mucha tristeza y preocupaci\u00f3n por su futuro continua trabajando duro para conseguir el sustento diario. Vive en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nTe\u00f3filo estableci\u00f3 un taller de enderezada y pintura de autos, gracias a la experiencia y conocimientos que su compadre y amigo le imparti\u00f3 desde hace 40 a\u00f1os. Trabaja de 8 a 10 horas en su taller y a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os ha logrado mejorar su negocio y obtener fidelidad y recomendaciones por parte de sus clientes. Alrededor de su taller existen otros que prestan los mismos servicios con los cuales es dif\u00edcil competir en precios porque Te\u00f3filo ha tenido varios impedimentos para conseguir pr\u00e9stamos que le permitan mejorar la variedad de los productos que ofrece, pero cuando recurri\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, todo cambi\u00f3 pues gracias a la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva, all\u00ed le facilitaron un pr\u00e9stamo con la agilidad y confianza que siempre esper\u00f3 y el cual lo utilizar\u00e1 solo en compra de materia prima y productos al por mayor para obtener mayor descuento y as\u00ed ofrecer precios competitivos a sus clientes. Las ganancias que obtenga de esta inversi\u00f3n los utilizar\u00e1 en parte para crear un fondo de ahorro para sustentar su vejez, pues por varios problemas de salud que le han molestado en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, Te\u00f3filo ha reflexionado que \u00e9l no estar\u00e1 siempre habilitado para realizar el trabajo que tiene.  ","en":"Te\u00f3filo is a 62 year old man who completed elementary school.  He has two adult children on their own, but the help him when he needs it.  He lives alone, although this causes him some sadness and concern about his future, he continues to work hard to gain his daily sustenance.  He lives in the Rio Verde Parish of Santo Domingo, the provincial capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, an Ecuadorian province that has had large growth in recent years.  Its capital is a city where the most attractive and appealing things are the delicious fruits and the food from this place.  It also has considerable business and has become a commercial trading port between the country\u2019s mountains and coasts.  It also includes various tourist attractions that, along with its warm weather, are very well known by local and foreign tourists.  This is the reason that most of its residents have started some type of merchant or service business for tourists.\r\n\r\nTe\u00f3filo set up an auto body and paint shop, thanks to his experience and knowledge his friend passed onto him 40 years ago.  He works 8 to 10 hours in his shop and has managed to improve his business and obtain loyalty and recommendations from his customers.  Others around his shop provide the same types of services so it\u2019s difficult to compete on price because Te\u00f3filo has had some trouble getting loans that allow him to expand the variety of products that he offers.  Everything changed when he approached Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.

She lives with Aurelio, who is 61, and with whom she has six children, to whom she offered education and raised with good manners and values. She lives in her own house, which she was able to construct 9 years ago with the help of her partner. Now she lives there with only one daughter and three grandchildren. She makes her greatest effort to advance for the good of her grandchildren and so that she can have a tranquil old age in the future.\r\n\r\nDoli's work consists of selling clothing, sandals, sneakers, and other accessories for daily use. All her merchandise is sent by her daughter in big packages from another city. When she receives her order, she selects the articles that she will sell. Every day she goes out through the streets of the city seeking customers. She takes all her merchandise with her to offer it from house to house. Her sales method is cash or credit, and she collects payments daily, weekly, or every two weeks. On the other hand, when she doesn't manage to sell everything in the city, she travels to the population centers near the shores of the river. There she manages to sell everything and return to her house very happy, approximately 10 days after having left the city. She began this work two years ago, and sometimes she gets help from her son, who has a vehicle and helps her transport her merchandise. She feels very satisfied for the good that she is doing at this new stage. \r\n\r\nShe is happy to have this work because it gives her a lot of time during the hours when she is not working, since she can do her housework with great ease. In addition, she has learned to earn the respect and confidence of her customers, based on her good treatment [of them] and her great smile. She has good sales, and as a result of this she obtains good earnings. Now she hopes to continue growing and in the future acquire a sales stand to continue with her work. This is her tenth loan from MFP, for which she is grateful to those who make possible her financing to continue with her goals.

Also, as winter approaches Mongolia, the automobile garage they use is in need of insulation. \r\n\r\nThus, he is requesting a loan of 6800000 MNT to purchase construction materials such as planks, panels, independent ceiling, doors, vacuum insulated windows, bricks, blocks, cement, sand, pebbles and an iron roof. As a result, his family will be able to live in a warm and comfortable home while parking their car in an insulated garage. Most importantly, his family will burn less coal to heat their house, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution. Additionally, a car parked in a warm garage has the benefits of stable usage, lower fuel consumption, and lower probability of breaking down compared to automobiles parked outside.

For 13 years, she has been living with 37-year-old Jos\u00e9, together with whom she has two younger children: 13-year-old Jos\u00e9 and 6-year-old Blanca. They have been living together in a rented house for 2 years and there they share their daily endeavor to improve their economic situation and to move forward on the road to progress. \r\n\r\nElizabeth's work consists of selling soft drinks to the general public. Also, she sells clothing for children and adolescents. She has recently established her small business on her doorstep, but she has been doing this activity for around 9 years. She always has worked alone because in that way she feels calmer considering that in this manner she maintains order and doesn't have any pressure while attending to customers. Sometimes she prepares desserts which she sells on the city streets to passers-by. She feels very happy because she knows that all the labor activities that she does generates the income that she needs to cover the basic expenses of her home; however, she knows that she has to continue to strive greatly in order to maintain this situation. She hopes to keep working to further grow her business, and later to buy herself land to construct her house and to establish a small bar there as a business. \r\n\r\nThis is her 9th loan with MFP; therefore, she is grateful for the opportunity and confidence that they place in her in order to receive this loan. On the other hand, she is once again committed to comply with the payment of her dues in a timely manner. In addition, she likes being a part of the communal bank which she belongs to since she has seen that its members are responsible people and supportive of one another. With the requested amount (3800 PEN), she will mainly buy liters of soft drinks. Also, she will buy certain clothing to sell in the summer.

is originally from El Salvador and arrived in the United States in 1993. In El Salvador, Abelardo owned a refreshments distribution company, and his wife, Luz, worked in a store as a clerk. They have four children, two older and two younger. \r\n\r\nIn 1998, Abelardo started working informally on various construction projects, specializing in drywall. After some initial success, he continued to work on small projects until he obtained the necessary licenses to register his small business, Abero Construction Inc., in 2006. \r\n\r\nAfter losing his home to foreclosure in 2008, Abelardo has worked hard to bounce back. Because of his 12 years of work in the industry, he used his network to obtain multiple contracts, usually as a subcontractor of a larger construction company. His business is now profitable, in part because he adapted his business model to only accept positions as lead contractor.\r\n\r\nAbelardo's Kiva loan will be used to support him with working capital to cover the daily expenses of his growing construction business and strengthen his business credit. Over the next six years, he hopes to double his profits and access more government contracts.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1261228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

is originally from El Salvador and arrived in Maryland five years ago. In a difficult decision, she left behind her parents and her 13-year-old son to try to create a better future for the family in the United States. In El Salvador, Guadalupe worked in the accounting department of a coffee factory.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, after exploring different ideas for businesses, Guadalupe started Multienvios, a small business in Langley Park, Maryland. She sells cell phones, calling cards, remittances services and a variety of merchandise ranging from jewelry to clothing. She started the business with funds she had saved for two years, and the business is profitable.\r\n\r\nThis year, Guadalupe seized an opportunity to expand her business into Virginia. By subletting a small space in Falls Church, she was able to register the business and hire a new full-time employee to work at the store. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe's Kiva loan will be used to support her with funds to buy new inventory, including cell phones for the holiday season, for the Virginia store. Having been denied a traditional bank loan, the loan will also help Guadalupe strengthen her credit history in the United States.\r\n\r\nShe currently lives in Silver Spring with her partner and their new 8-month-old son, David.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1261249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

He is married to a wonderful woman by the name of Dilorom. Hasan is a kind and hard-working person. He works in a candy factory in his country's capital city. Hasan's wife lives in the country's north, and he is only able to visit her once every 3 months. Hasan would like to be able to live together with his wife, but is forced to work mostly in the capital after being unable to find suitable employment in his home city.\r\n\r\nHasan works very hard and does not lead a healthy lifestyle, with no one to cook for him or launder his clothes. Due to his difficult living conditions, his health has suffered and he has been unable to father children. Since Hasan and his wife would love to have children, he is requesting a loan of 2500 somoni for medical treatment. This loan will help to improve a good person's health. Hasan is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1271430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical

propia que pudo construir como resultado de su arduo trabajo y es ah\u00ed donde a diario junto a su esposa comparte la alegr\u00eda de educar a sus hijos e intentar brindarles una mejor calidad de vida.\n\nLa actividad de Guido, como todos los d\u00edas, es de conducir mototaxi, para eso sale a las calles de la ciudad en su veh\u00edculo en busca de sus eventuales pasajeros a quienes transporta dentro y fuera de la ciudad con bastante serenidad y tranquilidad ya que considera que la seguridad de sus pasajeros es lo m\u00e1s importante, de la misma manera siempre brinda su numero de celular para que pueda ser contactado por alg\u00fan cliente que necesita de su servicio de transporte o eventualmente como electricista, es as\u00ed que pasa sus d\u00edas entre las calles de la ciudad y las casas a las que acude cuando es requerido para realizar alg\u00fan servicio de electricidad, su experiencia y la calidad de su trabajo lo coloca como una pieza clave en ambos oficios que desarrolla.  Eventualmente brinda servicio log\u00edstico a empresas particulares.\nLleva realizando estas actividades por 16 a\u00f1os y aunque al principio no le fue muy bien ahora afirma que esa situaci\u00f3n a cambiado y sus ingresos se han visto multiplicados gracias a las recomendaciones de cada uno de los clientes para quien ya trabaj\u00f3. Ahora espera continuar trabajando y m\u00e1s adelante implementarse con m\u00e1s unidades de mototaxi para empezar a alquilarlos y generar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos con mayor comodidad. por tanto agradece a quienes hacen posible su cr\u00e9dito para continuar con sus objetivos, por otro lado est\u00e1 muy comprometido una vez m\u00e1s a cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas como lo hizo en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo, est\u00e1 muy contento de pertenecer a su banco comunal ya que todos sus integrantes son muy buenos, amables y solidarios.\nCon el monto solicitado (S\/. 1500), renovar\u00e1 el tapizado y algunos repuestos que su mototaxi necesita para estar en \u00f3ptimas condiciones.\n\n","en":"Guido, who is 47, is an honest and very friendly man who has always worked hard to provide the best living conditions for his family.  He is married to Narda, who is 39, and is the father of three children, Melina (16), Alexa (11) and Jos\u00e9 (5). They all live together in their own home which Guido was able to build as a result of his hard work and here, along with his wife, he shares the daily joy of raising their children and trying to give them a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nGuido runs a motorcycle taxi business and so, every day, he drives round the city streets in search of potential passengers whom he drives within and outside the city.  He conducts himself in quite a calm and tranquil way as he believes that his passengers' safety is the most important thing.  Similarly, he always gives his mobile phone number so that he can be contacted by any client who needs his taxi service or possibly also his skills as an electrician.  Consequently, he divides his days between the city streets and the houses where he goes when he is needed to do an electrical job.  His experience and the quality of his work have made him indispensable in both of the jobs he does.  He could also provide a logistics service for private companies.  He has been involved in these businesses for 16 years and, although things did not go so well for him in the early days, he says that the situation has now changed and his income has grown significantly thanks to personal recommendations from all the customers he has worked for.  \r\n\r\nHe now hopes to continue working and, in time, equip himself with more motorcycle taxis so that he can hire them out and generate an income in an easier way.  He is, therefore, grateful to those who, by making possible his loan, will allow him to pursue his goals.  Furthermore, he is once again very determined to make his repayments on time, as he did his previous loans.  He is very happy to belong to his communal bank because all its members are very kind, friendly and supportive.  With the sum requested (S\/. 1500), he will renew the motorcycle taxi\u2019s upholstery and buy the spare parts necessary to keep it in the best possible condition.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1271747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to renew the motorcycle taxi\u2019s upholstery and buy the spare parts necessary to keep it in the best possible condition.  \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T13:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T13:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guido ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":228.71},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":227.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":247.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":256.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":266.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.48},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.48,"local_amount":228.71,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":233.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573196},{"amount":90.88,"local_amount":227.18,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":231.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122843},{"amount":99.09,"local_amount":247.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":252.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868665},{"amount":102.79,"local_amount":256.98,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":262.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577501},{"amount":106.63,"local_amount":266.56,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":271.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529736},{"amount":109.13,"local_amount":272.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":278.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974768}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T16:53:33Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":514976,"name":"Milka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milka used her previous loan amount to purchase rice, sugar and maize meal for use in her restaurant.

She is married to Stephen, a driver and is a mother to her children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nKaren operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nKaren hopes to expand her business and dreams of becoming rich. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1272072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To pay for recyclable materials from collectors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T13:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T13:20:08Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4091.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484623},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.98,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2727.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037132},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2726.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781651},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":682.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488546}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T14:43:34Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":514978,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is 47 years old, a married mother of four children between the ages of 20 and 27 years.

They live in a small village in the state of Manipur, one of the Seven North Eastern States, popularly known as the Seven Sisters. There is bus service from the main city, Imphal, and it takes about 3 hours' drive with a joyful bumpy ride.\r\n\r\nNempha is the profiled member, pictured with raised hand. She is 39 years old and is a mother to a son and a daughter who are in their teens. Other than farming and activities that result in daily wages, her husband does not have other means to earn income for the family. She grows vegetables in her homestead garden to maintain the family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 with her first loan she started a small grocery shop by her house for the family's main income. She sells potatoes, sugar, 'dal' (lentils), chillis, salt, cooking oil, hair oil, toothbrushes, spices and 'pulses'. With the sale proceeds she repaid her loan liability. She could not save much because most of the income was used for the children's education. With good faith, to stock her store afresh she was able to negotiate with the wholesaler from the town for the supply in partial payments. In this way she has been running her store and earning income for the family. Through her business now she is in a position to save INR 200 daily after meeting the family requirements. \r\n\r\nNempha needs another loan and this will be her second loan. She will use the loan to increase her store inventory that she will sell for a profit. She decided to expand to a department store for larger profit opportunities.

With the help of this new loan, their businesses will further improve both in size and quality. \n\nThe group leader, Bintu, will again use her share of the loan to buy cooking ingredients like rice, palm oil (the most popular cooking oil), tomatoes, Maggi (used to give sauce a sweet taste), onions, etc. in order to produce a larger quantity of cooked rice and sauce for sale.\n\n(Also included in the photo is loan officer Edmond, in the white shirt)\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1036291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy cooking ingredients in bulk in order to produce more food for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Koidu\/Kono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foday","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.63,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T12:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":500632.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340104645},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":500632.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347350191},{"amount":115.63,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-21T09:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":500632.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357089726},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":500632.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364821407},{"amount":115.63,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":500632.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373022592},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":500632.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381810482},{"amount":141.06,"local_amount":610000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":610771.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399916444},{"amount":90.19,"local_amount":390000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":390493.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410398643}],"funded_date":"2013-01-08T16:49:35Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:51:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":513975,"name":"Riva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Having the passion for entrepreneurship, Riva is asking for a new loan in the amount of KES 100,000 to expand his fish-selling business. \r\n\r\nHe plans to buy a deep freezer and more stock of fish.

Melinda has a big heart for the kids.\r\n\r\nMelinda co-owns a school that offers education from preschool up until high school. The students who enroll in the school are mostly from the community and from the nearby communities. She earns from the co-owners' sharing of capital gains. Her monthly income is 80,000 PHP (Philippines pesos).\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of the business, she is requesting a 40,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to pay the salaries of the employees and teachers and to pay for the maintenance of the school. The loan will also be used in paying for the bills, like electric, water, permits and other bills. She expects that the school will attract more students.\r\n\r\nMelinda hopes that there will be more children who will have an education, and she dreams of having her own house and lot. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

of Mongolia. Her family lives in a small house, in the outer ger (Mongolian housing tents) housing districts of the city. Odgerel\u2019s mother is retired and stays at home, while Odgerel's daughter attends secondary school. She built her house with her business income, especially with the help from the Kiva loan.\r\n\r\nOdgerel supports her family by operating a clothing retail stall at the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. In 2006, when she first began her business, she sold only leather belts and traditional Mongolian fabric belts. In the beginning stages of her business, she rented a stall at the present market from another person who had a rental contract with the market. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time. At the time, her stall had 1 million MNT (Mongolian tugriks) in working capital. Usually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract with Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand. \r\n\r\nAt this time of year, it is the one of high shopping seasons, since it's the beginning of the Tsagaan Sar holiday. Odgerel wants to use this loan to help support her inventory in this very busy shopping season of the year. Odgerel's business goal is to one day operate her own clothing shop. Odgerel also said, \"It's my personal goal to support my mother and daughter so they can live happily.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1272180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

In addition, her husband produces horseshoes and locally sells them. \r\n\r\nSeveral times, Marine requested a loan from local financial institutions for her agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nHer current loan request was approved because of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to loans since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Marine will purchase materials for horseshoes. Her husband will produce them and sell at a good price. Another part of the credit will be used for setting up a grain mill. Her mill will serve the local farmers and crush the grains.

Before him, his father had known the hardships \u2013 and the independence \u2013 of a life lived mainly in the jungles.  Rampant deforestation and extensive agriculture reduced forested land to a fraction of its past area.  By the time Daeng was born in 1983, the Mlabri people had been reduced to indentured servitude in the slash & burn fields of other ethnic groups in Thailand.\n\nDaeng grew up in the Ban Bunyuen village, and learned to read and write at the school there.  Basic education opened up many new avenues of knowledge for him, while village elders and his older relatives introduced him to the ways of the jungle.  Daeng thus straddles both generations; he is an example to the younger ones, and a help in guiding the older ones through the intricacies of modern life.\n\nDaeng does not have the same fear of the outside world as the older generation does.  He can hold his own in a pinch and he knows where to go for help when he\u2019s hard pressed.\n\nLike many of his fellow weavers, Daeng weaves hammocks to provide a better life for his wife and their children- he\u2019s a great dad!  He is savvy enough to make wise decisions in his purchases, yet retains a uniquely Mlabri penchant for helping others \u2013 something that weaving hammocks allows him to do. \n\nDaeng was one of the first to tell about Mlabri life in his lead role in the documentary film, The Importance of Being Mlabri.

For more than 20 years, she has been engaged in a fishing business with her husband.

In addition, Nazi has 13 bee-hives with bee colonies and sells the honey at a good price. \r\n\r\nNazi has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start a trading business, but without any success. Her loan requests were always rejected because of lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides credit to the rural poor who do not have access to it, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nNazi owns a building and plans to set up a grocery store there.

Having not had the chance to study, he consequently found no job opportunities and so he decided to learn how to create cleaning tools such as sweepers, floor mops and brushes. He then set up a tools factory in his house with the help of his family, and having studied the market by observing it, he came to the conclusion that floor mops were the mostly required products, thus deciding to specialize in this article. He is currently requesting a loan to buy raw materials in order to increase his production and to start expanding his activity to other areas of the department of Antioquia, Colombia.

She is separated from her partner, who is the father of her only child (a son of 17), and lives with her mother, her two brothers, her son and her sister-in-law in the house which was bequeathed to them by her father.  Our friend Lenny's main business activity is selling one of Peru's most traditional dishes: \"Cebiche\".  At different times of year, she also devotes some of her free time to selling women's, men's and children's clothing.  Her seafood restaurant is a family business which has been in existence for 11 years and she serves her customers there in a friendly way, helped by her mother, her sister-in-law, and her brothers.  Since she set up the business, she has achieved great success because her sales have always been positive.  From time to time she sells items of clothing.  She likes her work very much because it keeps her busy and enables her to generate the income she needs to cover her personal expenses and those of her son whom she loves very much.  So great has been the success she has achieved in her restaurant that she now wants to equip it with better furniture and other fittings to provide comfort for her customers.  This is her thirteenth loan from MFP and so she is grateful to all those who make it possible for her to continue to pursue her goals. Furthermore, she is once again very committed to make her repayments on time, as was the case for her other loans.  She is very happy to belong to her communal bank because all its members are very kind, friendly and caring.  She plans to spend the loan amount requested (S\/. 1800) on 4 tables with matching chairs, as well as various ingredients which she needs to continue her seafood restaurant business.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1269180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy 4 tables and matching chairs, as well as various ingredients which she needs to continue with her seafood restaurant business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lenny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":264.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":287.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":297.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":299.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":320.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":330.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.72,"local_amount":264.96,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":272.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573173},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":287.05,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":295.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122815},{"amount":119.92,"local_amount":297.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":306.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868638},{"amount":120.77,"local_amount":299.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":308.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577472},{"amount":128.9,"local_amount":320.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":329.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529709},{"amount":133.07,"local_amount":330.37,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":339.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974740}],"funded_date":"2013-01-10T01:17:59Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":514735,"name":"Fidela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fidela, de 58 a\u00f1os es una mujer trabajadora.

She began her business because she needs to generate income to support her family. She works at the business 15 hours a day, seven day a week. She describes her main challenges to her business as her customer's low purchasing power, which means she has to keep her prices too low. \r\n\r\nMamie requires a loan to buy more mayonnaise, eggs and cooking seasoning.

Her business is the only source of income she has, and her main challenge is a lack of capital. Isatu has requested a loan to buy more rubber slippers to sell. The extra income made possible by this loan will allow her to increase her capital and improve her living standards. In the future, she plans to expand her business by opening a store.

in eastern Sierra Leone. They are all local entrepreneurs who have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva, to apply for a loan of 500,000 SLL apiece. With the help of this loan, they will be able to expand their respective businesses, make more sales and consequently improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nAmadu is the leader of this group. The 24-year-old is single with no children. For a number of years now, Amadu has been selling bowls. Though capital is low, Amadu has been able to make a living out of his bowl business. With the help of this loan, however, his capital will increase a bit, enabling him to buy a larger quantity of bowls to add to his current stock.

She has been successfully running a small general store in her community for the last two years. She offers various goods for daily use. She has good communication skills and counts on a good client list. Her husband is employed in a small factory and earns insufficient income to support his family alone.

She has been married for 29 years to 55-year-old Neptal\u00ed, from whom she is inseparable and who is her unconditional friend. She has four children, two of which are now adults and two of which are still minors: Divana, 15, and Diego, 16. These two live with her in the house that she received as a gift when she got married, hence giving them the best she can offer so that they can grow up to be good people. \r\n\r\nThe work to which our friend Leni dedicates herself is the sale of food. At night she sets up her tables and her kitchen on the sidewalk to sell all of the dishes that she has prepared during the day. Many people come to her stand in search of a satisfying meal, consuming exquisitely seasoned stews. At the same time, she takes advantage of the opportunity to sell refreshing drinks and sometimes soft drinks of every flavor. She has been working at this job for 4 years now, and she has learned that she must always be in high spirits and put on a pleasant smile for her customers so that they feel good about coming to her and want to come back in the future. Some weekends she offers barbecue from morning until night.\r\n\r\nShe is very good in what she does, now that she has many customers with whom she is able to generate good daily earnings. She hopes to continue her work and in the future open her own restaurant to continue offering to her customers the best and most varied in what she refers to as culinary art. Therefore, she is thankful to those who would make this loan possible in order to continue her objectives. She is also very determined to once more make her payments on schedule as she has done with loans that she has received in the past. She is very happy to belong to a communal bank with such good, friendly and supportive members. With the amount for which she has asked (S\/. 1800; $725), she will be able to buy all of the staples that are necessary for the preparation of her meals.

Pheap and her husband earn a living for the family by working as rice farmers. Having been in the business for about 29 years, she manages to earn about US $8.50 per day to meet her daily needs and is able to save about US $4 each day for the family's future needs.\n\nThis is Pheap\u2019s first loan with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. This hard-working mother will utilize the requested loan to pay the tuition fees for her daughter\u2019s university education. This loan will enable her daughter to have an opportunity for higher education. Pheap\u2019s biggest hope is to support and keep her daughter in university to pursue her bachelor's degree in finance and banking so she will have a good job after graduation and a bright

She\u2019s single and has a 3-year-old little boy she cares for with much love and protection; she wants to provide him with a good quality of life.  She lives in her own house alongside her two sisters who she welcomes in her home affectionately.\r\n\r\nMary\u2019s work consists in sewing clothes.  She has a home-based workshop and has been doing this work for 16 years.  Everything she knows she learned working from a very young age as an employee of a woman who did this kind of work.  Gradually and with much patience she learned sewing techniques and then decided to become independent to generate her own income by putting into practice everything her former employer had taught her.\r\n\r\nDuring the time she\u2019s been in this activity, she\u2019s always sought the best way to do her work because often pressure from her customers has made her feel like she\u2019d be unable to do her work efficiently.  However, she faced these adversities and currently plans to expand the business but knows that the road to attain this is long and for the moment wants to keep it as a long-term goal.  For now, she\u2019s getting ready to start manufacturing her own designs to sell; she already has pending customer orders.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #4 and she\u2019s grateful to those who make the loan possible so she can continue towards her objectives.  On the other hand, she\u2019s committed once again to punctually make her installment payments like she\u2019s done with previous loans she got.  She\u2019s very happy to belong to her communal bank because all the members are very good, kind and mutually supportive.  She will use the requested 1,200 soles to increase her workshop buying fabric, needles, thread and other accessories she needs to continue with her clothes making work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1271797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She is a saleswoman and has a shop where she sells assorted basic products for the home and also cosmetics and Avon products like perfume, body lotion, shampoo, and deodorant.\r\n\r\nLuz started her business with her own savings. She would visit people she knew and offer them her products. She was very successful, so she decided it was time to invest in more merchandise, but she didn't have enough capital, so she took out her first loan with Ceprodel so that she could cover her customers' demand. Then she decided to set up a shop at home in order to obtain higher income and advertise her products more. \r\n\r\nShe is married and has two children who are in school, so she uses her profits to pay for their education.

They're obligatory for breakfast, so she has a lot of customers who even request them in quantity for various events.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan she wants to buy products to improve her store.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of converting her store into the biggest in the area in the future.\r\n\r\nRosa's grateful to all the people who make her loan possible.  To all those investors she would like to say thank you very much for supporting her communal bank!\r\n\r\nRosa's wearing a purple jacket and brown pants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4800,"image":{"id":1271820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products for her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":4800,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Lucinda Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosario Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mirian Carmela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Digna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yvon Yicela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2033},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2033},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2033},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2033},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2033},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2035}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":799.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":799.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":799.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":799.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":799.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":799.87,"local_amount":2033,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2039.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339505473},{"amount":799.87,"local_amount":2033,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2039.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347057427},{"amount":799.87,"local_amount":2033,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:51:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2039.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355803157},{"amount":799.87,"local_amount":2033,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2039.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364511466},{"amount":799.86,"local_amount":2033,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2039.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372916837},{"amount":800.66,"local_amount":2035,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2041.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381694721}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T04:18:15Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:03:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":514850,"name":"Johana De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Johanna de Jes\u00fas a sus 42a\u00f1os de edad casada con 3 hijos todos menores de edad 10(Primaria), 16(secundaria) y 20(Universidad ) a\u00f1os de edad , ella se dedica a la  compra venta de ropa nueva como: ropa de ni\u00f1o, adulto, peluches, accesorios de damas, entre otros.

","en":"Suhrob is 28 years old. He is single and lives with his parents, brother and sister. His brother is married with children. However, his brother is not in a position to provide for his family. As such, his brother's wife has decided to start her own business sewing women's clothing. \r\n\r\nSuhrob's parents live on their small pension. They have asked Suhrob to help his brother and sister-in-law buy a sewing machine. Suhrob has driven a taxi for more than 3 years, and uses that income to support his family. He is a very hardworking, friendly person, so he has attracted a number of regular clients over the last few years. \r\n\r\nAs an honest person, Suhrob could not in good conscience refuse his parents' request. He has promised to buy a sewing machine for his brother's wife so that she can start her business and use it to support her children. Suhrob is requesting a loan of 2500 somoni for the purchase of a sewing machine. He awaits your

Ever since she formed her family with Miguel, they have worked side by side in order to get their family ahead and to, each day, have the opportunity for a better life.\n\nShe also told us that in the future she would like to start a new business and continue performing maintenance on the truck.

She feels comfortable doing her job and believes it's going well for her because of her good care and friendly customer service.\r\n\r\nIvette's very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she'll be able to cover the expenses for the college prep studies her daughter needs.  This way Ivette will help her daughter have a better education and preparation, and she'll continue working and making the effort to achieve her big dream of having her own house and seeing her daughter become a good professional.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1271893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to cover her daughter's educational expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-01-09T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-08T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivette Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":119.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":124.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":135.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":134.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":141.3},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":145.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":152.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":156.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":162.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":169.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":175.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":182.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.21,"local_amount":119.7,"processed_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":122.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339479110},{"amount":50.08,"local_amount":124.34,"processed_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":127.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031797},{"amount":54.43,"local_amount":135.13,"processed_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":138.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776287},{"amount":54.15,"local_amount":134.43,"processed_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":138.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483103},{"amount":56.91,"local_amount":141.3,"processed_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":145.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889146},{"amount":58.46,"local_amount":145.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":149.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664061},{"amount":61.25,"local_amount":152.07,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":156.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775135},{"amount":341.51,"local_amount":847.88,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":870.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778825}],"funded_date":"2013-01-09T04:35:38Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:40:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":515328,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is engaged in a general store business in her village in the remote area of Cabisera 25, province of Isabela.
