","en":"Burmakan is 46 years old, married, and has a son who is currently a university student. Burmakan has secondary education. She is a very calm and enterprising woman. As the main source of income for her family, Burmakan has been raising livestock since 2002, as well as growing crops since 1992, having started her business with a sum of 20,000 som. Thanks to her hard work, Burmakan's herd currently includes 2 cows and 21 goats and sheep, and she also works 3.6 hectares of land where she annually grows beans and perennial grasses.

la cual consigui\u00f3 el apoyo para terminar la escuela primaria, trabaj\u00f3 ayudando a sus padres desde muy joven y ahora convive con su pareja \u00c1ngel de 64 a\u00f1os que se dedica al comercio ambulante y con quien tiene 3 hijos quienes se educan en una escuela p\u00fablica y Elba espera poder apoyarles en su educaci\u00f3n hasta que se conviertan en profesionales de excelencia. Elba y su familia viven en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nElba y su esposo han vivido situaciones dif\u00edciles econ\u00f3micamente pero no se han dado por vencidos y siempre han llevado el alimento a la mesa y a sus hijos nunca les ha faltado nada para su educaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, hace 4 a\u00f1os Elba decidi\u00f3 aportar a su hogar preparando unos helados con una receta secreta de su familia, los cuales son muy conocidos en la zona. Ella los prepara en las noches, cuando sus chicos ya descansan y los vende en el d\u00eda con la ayuda de sus hijos que le acompa\u00f1an al volver de la escuela.  Al dar a conocer el exquisito y refrescante sabor de sus helados, Elba ha ganado clientes y muy buena reputaci\u00f3n, por lo que los helados se terminan inmediatamente ya que apenas prepara la cantidad que puede almacenar en su refrigeradora. Ahora Elba requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para poder adquirir un congelador exclusivo para helados, de esta forma producir\u00eda m\u00e1s y sus ganancias ser\u00e1n mayores. Anteriormente ya ha realizado cr\u00e9ditos con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y ha regresado a solicitar su ayuda porque le ofrecen facilidades de pago y la atenci\u00f3n es excelente, mucho m\u00e1s ahora que puede aplicar al producto de kiva para que muchas personas en el mundo tambi\u00e9n formen parte de su sue\u00f1o de crecimiento. ","en":"Elba is a 34-year old woman who grew up in a family with limited resources. Nevertheless, she had the support to finish primary education, worked helping her parents since she was very young and now lives with her partner, Angel (64 years old), who works as a traveling salesman. Together they have 3 children, who attend a public school, and Elba expects to be able to provide them with an education to become excellent professionals. Elba and her family live in La Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, in Santo Domingo, capital of the Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, Ecuador, which has experienced a great sustainable growth in the last few years. The biggest attraction in the capital is its delicious fruit and cuisine. It also counts with a significant commercial sector, as it has become a ground port of commercial exchange between the Sierra and Costa regions. Moreover, it has several tourist attractions which, together with the warm weather, attract many local and foreign tourists. For this reason, the majority of its population has initiated a commercial or services activity for other residents or tourists. \r\n\r\nElba and her husband have gone through financially difficult situations, but they have never given up and have always been able to bring food to their home and to provide their children with everything they needed for their education. However, 4 years ago, Elba decided to contribute to the household expenses by preparing ice cream with a secret recipe of her family, and it has become very popular in the area. She makes it at nights, when her children are sleeping, and sells it during the day with her kids' help, who give her a hand when they come back from school. Thanks to the delicious and refreshing flavor of her ice cream, Elba has earned clients and a very good reputation. She makes the quantity she can fit in her freezer and the ice cream is sold immediately. \r\n \r\nElba is now requesting a loan to buy a freezer exclusively for ice cream, so that she will be able to make a larger quantity and increase her earnings. She has had loans with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa before and has decided to ask for financial support again given that the repayment conditions and the service she receives are excellent. She is excited to use this Kiva loan and to share her business growth dream with many people around the world.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1272456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

Sadly, she suffered the loss of her beloved husband, and since then she has dedicated all of her efforts to providing for her family.  Regrettably, although she would have liked very much to study a professional career, she was not able to do so because of a lack of economic resources and needing to work to cover her expenses.\r\n\r\nIn her free moments Claudia likes to watch television, and on certain occasions she cooks a delicious Seco de Res [a cilantro beef stew] to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with a lot of effort and determination, Claudia works in her small food stall, where she sells delicious kebabs, tripe and liver, among other things.  She works everyday for approximately six hours.

Curs\u00f3 estudios de nivel primario, y el obst\u00e1culo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil que ha atravesado fue la muerte de su esposo hace algunos a\u00f1os. Tiene 6 hijos adultos que viven de manera independiente, excepto Lilian de 21 a\u00f1os con quien vive en la actualidad en Atuntaqui una ciudad de la provincia de Imbabura en  el norte del Ecuador.  Un lugar que goza de muchos lugares hist\u00f3ricos que ofrecer a quienes le visitan adem\u00e1s de una deliciosa gastronom\u00eda que es la favorita de  muchos en el pa\u00eds. Otra actividad que es muy conocida en este cant\u00f3n es la textil, pues el dise\u00f1o de ropa industrial y artesanal se ha convertido en una actividad que aporta al crecimiento sostenido de la ciudad por lo que las prendas elaboradas son preferidas por su diferente calidad y dise\u00f1os a nivel nacional e internacional. Cuenta con un clima agradable que es seco y templado lo que ayuda mantener sus tierras f\u00e9rtiles y por lo tanto aptas para el cultivo de cereales y legumbres. Por todas estas oportunidades existentes en la ciudad, Atuntaqui es considerado un centro productivo importante para el Ecuador, m\u00e9rito que no fuese posible sin la fuerza y esp\u00edritu emprendedor de sus habitantes que a la vez generan plazas de trabajo para las familias de la Provincia.\nExpuesta a inesperadas lluvias y a temperaturas fuertes de sol, Blanca ha mantenido su negocio de venta de ropa casual en un puesto designado en la calle donde varios comerciantes de ropa exhiben su mercader\u00eda. Blanca lleva en esta actividad 6 a\u00f1os y en el cual invierte 10 horas cada d\u00eda desde muy temprano en la ma\u00f1ana hasta que el sol se oculta. Paralelamente a esta actividad, Blanca siempre est\u00e1 pendiente de su casa y los quehaceres que hay en ella y traslada sola la mercader\u00eda hasta su lugar de trabajo que aunque son bultos de gran tama\u00f1o su deseo de trabajar y sentirse \u00fatil la ha llevado a adquirir experiencia en todos estos detalles. A trav\u00e9s del tiempo Blanca sabe que cada temporada del a\u00f1o la demanda por cierto tipo de ropa cambia pero que los gustos por la ropa de siempre se mantienen, es por esto que requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar ropa de temporada e incrementar la variedad de ropa que ya tiene, para que sus clientes puedan encontrar lo que buscan y as\u00ed Blanca pueda generar m\u00e1s ingresos que le permitan cubrir sus necesidades y adem\u00e1s mejorar la calidad de vida.

","en":"Blanca, 60, is a hardworking woman who despite her age continues to work seeking daily support ignoring the health issues her age sometimes presents.  She attended elementary school and the hardest challenge she\u2019s had to face was the death of her husband some years ago.  She has six adult children who live on their own, except Lilian, 21, who currently lives with her in Atuntaqui, a city in Imbabura Province in northern Ecuador.  This is a place that has many historic sites of interest to those who visit in addition to a delicious cuisine that is the favorite of many in the country.  Another well-known activity in this canton is textiles for industrial and artisanal clothes making has become an activity that contributes to the city\u2019s support since the clothes manufactured here are preferred for their quality and design both nationally and internationally.  It has a pleasant climate that\u2019s dry and mild which helps keep the soil fertile and apt for growing cereals and legumes.  Because of all these opportunities available in the city, Atuntaqui is considered to be an important productive center in Ecuador, a distinction that would not have been possible without the strength and enterprising spirit of its residents who at the same time generate employment for families in the Province.\r\n\r\nExposed to sudden rainfalls and high temperatures under the sun, Blanca has kept her casual clothing business open in an assigned stand on the street where several clothes merchants display their merchandise.  Blanca has been in this activity for six years and she puts in ten-hour work days starting very early in the morning and going until sunset.  Blanca is also always watchful of her home and the chores that must be done there; she also transports the merchandise by herself to her work space even though the bundles are very large.  She wants to work and feel useful and this has led her to gain experience in all these details.\r\n\r\nAs time has passed, Blanca has learned that each season of the year demands a certain type of clothes b but that as styles change, good taste does not which is why she needs a loan to buy seasonal clothes to increase the variety of clothes she has so that her customers will find what they are looking for and Blanca will generate higher income to cover her needs and improve her quality of life.  Blanca is grateful for the trust and quickness with which Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has provided her loan and thanks people who through Kiva are part of her growth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1273017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy seasonal clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Atuntaqui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-01-09T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-08T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Fanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1084,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":62.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":63.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":69.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":71.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":76.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":77.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":80.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.48},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.48,"local_amount":62.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":63.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516839},{"amount":64.75,"local_amount":63.8,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":64.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068694},{"amount":67.86,"local_amount":66.88,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494960},{"amount":67.35,"local_amount":66.37,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":67.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524888},{"amount":69.22,"local_amount":68.21,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":69.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133192},{"amount":70.05,"local_amount":69.03,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":70.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313733},{"amount":697.29,"local_amount":687.15,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":697.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565339}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T14:27:30Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":515503,"name":"Abena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abena sells cassava, bananas, and plantains at Besease, near Elmina.

She sews clothes at home. Thanks to her excellent service she has a wide range of clients. Her clients are women with taste, and it is very difficult to satisfy them, but Hosiyat easily copes with their whims. She handles all of the family expenses herself, since her husband is unemployed. She told her husband that he must find work, since it is hard for her to support the family by herself.  Her husband asked her to buy a ticket to Leningrad where he has friends who can help him find a job. Hosiyat has no money, so she is asking for a loan of 2500 Somoni to buy a ticket for her husband. She is counting on you and your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1272802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a plane ticket so that her husband can work abroad.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Yavan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.313056 69.043056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-01-09T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-08T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hosiyat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":175.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":187.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":183.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":195.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":197.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":203.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":210.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":212.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":225.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":229.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":235.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":243.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.6,"local_amount":226.69,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:59:00Z","rounded_local_amount":226.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339741016},{"amount":477.4,"local_amount":2273.31,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056313}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T13:43:49Z","paid_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":515564,"name":"Nena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nena, de 57 a\u00f1os es una mujer valiente y emprendedora.

She\u2019s been doing this work half-time with her mother helping her tend to the public.  She considers the business to be profitable because of the good profits it nets and because her customers are increasing daily.\r\n\r\nShe likes her activity because it gives her an occupation and she feels like a productive woman; this relaxes and distracts her.

The group is mainly comprised of women whose major activity is trade and agriculture. They fall into several family demographic categories, including divorced, widowed, single mothers, and a few who are married.\r\n\r\nRose is a single mother of three children. She lost her husband, three years back, in a car accident. Her three children are all in school. In addition, she looks after her two nephews, who are also orphans. \r\n\r\nRose is mainly an agriculturalist who grows crops and raises goats and sheep. She supplements the farming with income from a small restaurant, with capital of UGX 100,000. She resorted to farming in 2010, after losing her husband, so that she could feed her children and take them to school.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy goats and sheep to sell, to buy more materials to use in her restaurant, and to use some of the money to pay tuition for her children. Her customers are mainly neighbors and passersby. \r\n\r\nRose's main challenge is theft around the village. Sometimes thieves steal her goats and sheep after she has invested her money in them, especially the loan money, and this affects her cash flow. Sometimes she or her children fall sick and, on such days, she is unable to till her land. \r\n\r\nDespite all the challenges, Rose is very hard-working and determined to change her future, along with that of the children, by giving them a good education.

He works hard every day during the season.  His work season starts in March and lasts until November.  Every day he earns from 100 somoni to 150 somoni and uses his earnings for the needs of the family.  His work is hard and this is why he lost his health.  Right now he does not have a lot of work so he would like to seek medical treatment.  Alas he does not have money for treatment and his wife cannot help him because she is a homemaker.  He is asking for a loan of 1000 somoni to purchase medicine for his treatment.  He is seriously ill and is anxiously waiting for your help and kindness.

She decided to sell seafood, and little by little her business has grown to the point where she now has a good customer base.\r\n\r\nEveryday she gets up at 6 a.m. and goes to her stall which is located near the seafront boardwalk.  Here her products are well known for being fresh.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy various showcases and freezers.  Her goal is to grow her business and to put together the capital necessary to open another seafood business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1273112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

There, she takes advantage of the opportunity to do her daily shopping. Once she gets home, she starts to prepare her delicious dishes, which have made her very well-known in her neighborhood. She has been working in this business for more than two years, with the help of her sister.\r\n\r\nShe believes that her work is profitable because it generates a good income. Before starting this business, she worked for other people and had a difficult time because she did not earn a good income. She always suffered in order to pay her home expenses. Eventually, she decided that it was time to start her own business and become independent. Now that she has her own business, everything is going much better. She wishes to continue growing and become a prosperous entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan amount of 1000 Peruvian soles, she will buy ingredients to make fast food, such as potatoes, boxes of oil, and others, in large quantities. She will then be able to continue with her business. She also needs to refurbish some chairs and tables in order to better serve her clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1273102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make fast food such as potatoes and boxes of oil, among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-09T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-08T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sulejka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":149},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":158.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":164.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":173.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":183.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.6,"local_amount":149,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":151.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122860},{"amount":63.45,"local_amount":158.63,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":161.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868682},{"amount":65.82,"local_amount":164.54,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":167.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577518},{"amount":68.27,"local_amount":170.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":174.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529753},{"amount":69.46,"local_amount":173.65,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":177.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974784},{"amount":73.4,"local_amount":183.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":187.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996075}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T16:16:55Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":515592,"name":"Millicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Millicent is a resident of the Kilifi area of Coast province, Kenya.

She is a business lady and runs a clothes business which she has been operating for ten years. In this business she sells shawls, handbags, pants, shoes, etc. She also sells charcoal and is formally employed.\r\n\r\nShe learnt about Milango through friends who invited her to the group and she joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations.

la cual consigui\u00f3 el apoyo para terminar la escuela primaria, trabaj\u00f3 ayudando a sus padres desde muy joven y ahora est\u00e1 casado con Shirley de 33 a\u00f1os quien trabaja como secretaria en una oficina de impresi\u00f3n de fotos y con quien tiene 1 hijo a\u00fan peque\u00f1o a quien espera poder apoyarles en su educaci\u00f3n hasta que se convierta en profesional. Edwin y su familia viven en la Parroquia de Bomobol\u00ed de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nEdwin recorre por toda la ciudad y a veces por las afueras de la misma en su taxi que con mucho esfuerzo adquiri\u00f3 desde hace dos a\u00f1os. Con el apoyo de sus padres quienes tambi\u00e9n formaron parte de una compa\u00f1\u00eda de taxis, Edwin emprendi\u00f3 en este duro y cansado trabajo al cual le dedica hasta 14 horas diarias sin un horario fijo y expuesto a los peligros de la delincuencia que ha crecido en la regi\u00f3n. Para Edwin es muy importante que su auto tenga todo los repuestos y revisiones en orden para brindar a sus clientes seguridad y comodidad al momento del uso del servicio, es por esto que acudi\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva le ayuden a financiar varios de los repuestos y arreglos que necesita su auto que es el sustento de su familia a diario. Edwin sue\u00f1a con un d\u00eda poder obtener su vivienda propia y ver a su hijo convertido en un profesional destacado, metas que obtendr\u00e1 con trabajo y esfuerzo y aun sacrificando tiempo con su familia ya que la labor de taxista requiere tiempo extendido en las noches y madrugadas. ","en":"Edwin is 28 years old and grew up in a family with limited resources but which nonetheless supported him to finish primary school.  He worked from an early age helping his parents.\r\n\r\nToday Edwin is married to Shirley, who is 33 years old and works as a secretary in a photo printing office.  Together they have one son who is still very young and whom they hope to be able to support in his education until he becomes a professional.\r\n\r\nEdwin and his family live in the parish of Bomobol\u00ed of Santo Domingo, which is the capital city of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas.  This province has in recent years experienced a high level of sustained growth.  The most attractive and striking aspects of the capital city are its delicious fruits and gastronomy.  It is also a considerable commercial center since it became a land port for commercial trade between the Sierra and Costa regions of the country.  Santo Domingo also has many tourist attractions that, accompanied by its warm climate, are very popular with both national and international tourists. It is for this reason that the majority of the city\u2019s inhabitants have taken up some commercial activity or service directed at the city\u2019s inhabitants and tourists.\r\n\r\nEdwin goes all over the city, and at times its outskirts, in his taxi, which he acquired with a lot of effort two years ago.  With the support of his parents, who also are part of a taxi company, Edwin took up this difficult and tiring work in which he works 14 hours a day without a fixed schedule and is exposed to the dangers of the crime that has grown in the region. \r\n\r\nIt is very important for Edwin that his car have all of its spare parts and repairs in order so that he can provide his customers security and comfort when they use his service.

He learned of Milango from his friends and is applying for a loan of 83,450 Kenyan shillings to purchase the motorcycle for the business. \r\n\r\nDespite the challenges of perishability, high

She lives in an adobe house and owns some parcels of land where the main crops are coffee and annatto.  She used to have a grocery store but did poorly due to limited demand.  She works as an agricultural producer having started when she was a girl and becoming independent at the age of 18 thanks to a material inheritance she got from her parents.  \r\n\r\nShe feels good with her work because she\u2019s able to support her family with profits earned.  When the rainy season starts in the zone she wants to be able to hire day laborers for the coffee and annatto crops and to do so must have enough capital available.  Another requirement needed for quality products is to purchase organic manure which can be gotten now at a modest price due to demand thus being able to provide integrated fertilization of her parcels.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons behind her efforts once her children have grown is to build her house with bricks and cement so she can rent it out and earn a steady income for her old age.

She comes from a good family and is a conscientious and honest woman.\r\n\r\nNigora's parents were not in a position to give her a higher education.  So she married after high school and started working right away because her husband earns a small salary which is not enough to provide for the family.  In the beginning, Nigora worked as a waitress in a cafeteria.  She did not enjoy this work; she had to force herself to do it and only worked for the money.  After a period of two years, she started her own sewing business, making women's clothes.  Thanks to the high quality of her services, she now has her own regular customers.  Her customers are happy with her work because she is very neat and approachable.  \r\n\r\nNigora would like to further develop her business, and to do so she needs a new sewing machine.  She is requesting a loan of 3,000 somoni to buy a sewing machine.

She is convinced that with the help of God and this institution, she will get good results from this decision, and she will be able to improve her earnings, which will allow her to improve her quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1273383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of garments such as:  skirts, blouses, pants, t-shirts, and more items that will allow her to attract more customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-01-10T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-09T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":26.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":27.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30.03},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":32.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":37.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27,"local_amount":27,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846845},{"amount":28.35,"local_amount":28.35,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":28.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347004696},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364451225},{"amount":69.6,"local_amount":69.6,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":69.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382265193},{"amount":78.21,"local_amount":78.21,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":78.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399735432},{"amount":136.84,"local_amount":136.84,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":136.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419768930}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T18:15:00Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T10:33:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deepa R.","image":null}},{"id":515760,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"To generate income, Yolanda engages in buying and selling of boiled corn, buko pie, and buko juice (coconut pie and juice) in the community.

Her business is located in her home and is particularly well frequented because of the high quality of her tamales and the other food she sells.  Toribia is a hardworking and enterprising woman whose great ambition is to support her children, give them a good education and improve their quality of life.  She works very hard to keep her business afloat and to continue providing excellent quality goods and foodstuffs for her customers, since this is her main and sole source of income.

Margret hopes that in the future she will be able to construct over 10 rental houses to provide 100,000 UGX each month. \r\n\r\nMargret is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Margret who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1273509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

He believes this his business will succeed because he has being keeping fowls for a long time, he is also a trained carpenter, there is high demand for fuel wood in the community, and he has a good business site and also regular customers who buy from him. \r\n\r\nThe community will benefit because they will not go a long distance to buy wood. He will also produce chairs, beds, and repairs for the public.\r\n\r\nThe profits will help him in improving the housing conditions of the family, providing better education for the family and expanding his business. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the convenient repayment period, low interest and the social education they provide.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1273548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

She earns her living selling meals: breakfasts and lunches such as tamales, eggs, beans, soups, meat dishes and salads, among other things.  She has been running the business for a number of years and, through it, has gained plenty of sales experience, which allows her to make bigger profits.  She plies her trade in a place which she considers very favourable for her business and she is well known throughout her community for preparing the most delicious dishes in the area.  She now has a large regular clientele who prefer her because she sells only goods of the highest quality, prices them reasonably and, above all, delivers excellent service. \r\n\r\nMargarita is busy, enterprising, dedicated to her work and always willing to strive to find the best opportunities for success.

The rest of the loan will be used to buy fowl and the feed needed for the upkeep of the fowl. She believes her business will succeed because of her longevity in the business and the high demand for food stuff such as beans and yams in the community. She has a good business site and also regular customers who buy from her for resale and restaurants. The community will benefit because they will not go long distance to buy food items.\r\n\r\nThe profits will help her increase her business, provide better education for the family and expand her business.

When he lost his job, it was like the world was coming to an end. Inadequate financing to start up a business, provide square meals to his children and pay for their education is also a problem.\r\n\r\nWith the new loan, Ambe plans to purchase piglets, construct a modern pigsty, and buy feed for the pigs. He believes that his business will succeed because he has being keeping pigs for a long time, the demand for piglets and pork meat in the community is high, and he has a good business site and regular customers who buy from him for resale and restaurants. The community will benefit because they will not have to go a long distance to buy good piglets and matter for their farm use.\r\n\r\nThe profits will help Ambe improve the housing conditions of his family, provide better education for his children and expand his project.

Catering to his children's education is also a problem.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Vutsile will purchase piglets, construct a modern pig pen, and buy three bags of feed for the pigs. He believes this his business will succeed because he has being keeping pigs for a long time, there is a high demand for piglets and pork meat in the community, he has a good business site, and also regular customers who buy from him for resale and for a restaurant. The community will benefit because they will not have to go long distances to buy good piglets and manure for their farm use.\r\n\r\nThe profits will help Vutsile to improve the housing conditions of the family, provide better education for the family, and expand his business. He prefers a loan from Grounded and Holistic Approach for People's Empowerment (GHAPE) because of the convenient repayment period, low interest, and the social education they provide.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1273542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy piglets and feed and construct a pig pen.

Part of the loan will be invested in farming and in buying seedlings.

Also, the demand for foods such as rice and other provision items is high in the community. She has a good business site and also regular customers who buy from her for resale and restaurant. The community will benefit because they will not go a long distance to buy her items, especially smoked fish.\r\n\r\nThe profits will help her expand her business and provide better education for the family.
