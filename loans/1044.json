She works selling \"pupusas\" (stuffed tortillas) made of rice and corn, and has several years of experience in the business, which has given her the opportunity to always obtain the highest profit. Her store or \"pupuser\u00eda\" is well located and counts with many clients. People choose it over others because it sells the most delicious and warmest pupusas in the area, and offers the best price and fastest service. Francisca is very dedicated to her job, and is willing to give everything in her power to reach her dreams. Her biggest secret is her determination, which she knows will help her to be successful. \r\n\r\nOver the last few months, the demand has increased and she needs to make an additional investment. She doesn't have enough capital to invest, which is why she's requesting a loan to INTEGRAL to buy corn, beans, pork rinds, cheese, vegetables, beverages, etc. Francisco has good payment references and has committed to repay the loan. She also has faith she'll be able to provide her family with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1273493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, beans, pork rinds, cheese, vegetables and beverages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-01-10T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-09T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":31.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":32.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.76,"local_amount":61.76,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":61.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846868},{"amount":32.89,"local_amount":32.89,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":32.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347004725},{"amount":34.28,"local_amount":34.28,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":34.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356448101},{"amount":34.8,"local_amount":34.8,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":34.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364451254},{"amount":36.27,"local_amount":36.27,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":36.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373082380}],"funded_date":"2013-01-10T18:10:18Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:06:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esther Alcaina","image":1232159}},{"id":515900,"name":"Maher","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maher is from Iraq.

Karim's son helps him in his work and is learning how to look after the livestock. \r\n\r\nThis business provides the main financial income in his family, but at present it is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children.

This business has provided her with extra earnings, giving her and her husband the help they so need to pay for their house and bills on time, as well as the food and other items needed to live with dignity. \r\n\r\nBecause of this Karen wants to stock more products in the shop, which is why she is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL. Through this loan she can buy rice, beans, sugar, dairy products, drinks and other goods which are essential in any good shop. This is very important to Karen since there is a lot of competition nearby. As a result, she must do everything she can to satisfy her customers and attract others who prefer to buy from her shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1273796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic grains, cheese and other products to stock her shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-01-10T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-09T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karen Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":28.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":29.1},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":31.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":34.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":35.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":38.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.81,"local_amount":57.81,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":57.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846872},{"amount":29.93,"local_amount":29.93,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":29.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347004729},{"amount":31.64,"local_amount":31.64,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":31.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356448105},{"amount":32.71,"local_amount":32.71,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":32.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364451258},{"amount":247.91,"local_amount":247.91,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":247.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373082384}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T16:13:58Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:06:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":515940,"name":"Farayil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farayil, age 52, breeds livestock to earn a living.

Frank and his wife have one child.\r\n\r\nFrank would like to improve his crop production, which is why he is now requesting additional capital in the amount of PhP 15,000.

Madona had requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from her husband\u2019s job as a distributor at a private company. He makes 750 Laris per month, hardly enough to feed a three-member family. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMadona has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. With the received credit, Madona will purchase clothing from wholesalers and will resell at higher prices. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of her family.

Uganda. He is married and has three children, two of them currently in school. For the past seven years, Ahmedi has been working hard to manage his small business, where he sells second-hand shoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Ahmedi has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. He will use the loan funds to buy the best quality second-hand shoes, which will attract more customers. This use of the loan will help him to generate greater profits, to pay school fees for his children, and to have a better life. He hopes that, in the future, he will be able to open up a big wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nAhmedi is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

age 40, is involved in a family agricultural business in Mtskheta District, where she lives with her husband and their 24-year-old son. The sole source of income for the family is the agricultural business. They have a milk cow and produce cheese from its milk, which they sell on the open market in the capital city. \r\n\r\nNanuli and her husband decided to start a new business, as their existing income is not enough to adequately provide for the family. With the loan funds, Nanuli will purchase a car and her husband will serve the local people as a taxi driver. They also will use the car in trading, which will save them the transportation costs of transporting their dairy products. Their overall income will increase and they will be able to improve the living conditions of the family.

Only one of her children is still in secondary education, with the others now being independent.  Santos set up her business with financial support from her husband who died when the business had become established.  From that moment she had to lean on her older children to get by, as six people were dependent on the business.  With two of the children still small, the older ones had to give up their studies to help with the work, but now only one daughter is still dependent as the older ones have left home.  One of Santos Francisca's ambitions is to see her daughter complete her university education.  Her business consists of making and selling corn bread.  She is seeking funding to buy raw materials (corn) for the production of 'cosa de horno' (a type of corn bread) and will invest it in her bakery business.  She belongs to the Dios es Amor (God is Love) solidarity group, along with the two other members, Julia Bertha and Dany.  Julia Bertha is 45 years old, single and the mother of two children of 9 and 16, who are both at school.  Her business consists of selling general merchandise such as clothing, shoes, mobile phones and accessories, laminated steel and silver, amongst other things.  She has had this business for two years, having begun with scant resources and having gradually invested more in her merchandise.  She travels to Panama to buy different ranges of products to offer to her customers.   She sells for cash and on credit and is seeking funding to invest more in her working capital.  Dany, who is 28 and single, owns his own bakery which is located in his home in Chinandega.  He devoted tremendous effort to setting up his business with his own money which he managed to scrape together during the time that he worked with his mum in the bakery where he learned the trade.  He buys his raw materials in Somotilla and travels around selling his goods for cash to regular clients such as grocery shops.  In these regions there is a great demand for clothing sales and foodstuffs as it is a region devoted predominantly to cattle rearing and agriculture.  This is the first time that the group\u2019s members have sought funding to increase their stocks and they are grateful for any support which will help them to continue running their businesses.

She makes a living in agriculture, which has always taught her to work hard. She began producing cocoa when she was 15 years old, on some plots of land her parents gave her to work.

To accelerate the production process, Clotilde hires day labor to help with the weeding, fertilizing, and grafting seedlings. \r\n\r\nShe will be starting a new growing season when the rainy season arrives, so she will need enough capital to fertilize her cocoa trees and to replant some outdated plots of land. Daily maintenance of the plants considerably helps her to obtain the best quality product to sell at the best prices collectors in the region offer. Clotilde's long-term goals include opening a grocery store alongside her agricultural activity. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 2,500 Peruvian soles in order to buy organic fertilizer: guano de la isla, as well as to pay the wages of the day workers who weed and fertilize her cocoa plants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1273822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic fertilizers, such as bird droppings, and to pay day laborer's wages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-10T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-09T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clotilde ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":273.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":291.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":301.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":297.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":320.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":322.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":342},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":350.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.42,"local_amount":273.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":279.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573213},{"amount":116.61,"local_amount":291.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":297.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122865},{"amount":120.45,"local_amount":301.12,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":307.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868687},{"amount":118.94,"local_amount":297.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":303.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577523},{"amount":128.32,"local_amount":320.81,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":327.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529758},{"amount":129.15,"local_amount":322.87,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":329.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974789},{"amount":136.8,"local_amount":342,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":349.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996080},{"amount":140.31,"local_amount":350.77,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":358,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863698}],"funded_date":"2013-01-13T23:51:17Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":515981,"name":"Sahr Emmanuel's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured above are primary school teachers in Koidu, a city in eastern Sierra Leone.

con una educaci\u00f3n completa, pero aprob\u00f3 la escuela primaria y desde ni\u00f1o ayud\u00f3 a sus padres en las labores de agricultura. Es soltero y no tiene hijos y vive en el cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. Jonathan reside en la Parroquia Luz de Am\u00e9rica de este cant\u00f3n, un sector que es considerado como el port\u00f3n de entrada a la Provincia, por la riqueza de su tierra ha sido el nido de varias empresas productoras de alimentos adem\u00e1s que es la zona de mayor producci\u00f3n de papaya, fruta ex\u00f3tica exportada desde aqu\u00ed. Es por esto que los habitantes de esta parroquia en su gran mayor\u00eda, se dedican a la agricultura, lo cual ha sido la motivaci\u00f3n para que varios emprendedores de la zona fortalezcan esta actividad con su trabajo, experiencia y  esfuerzo.\nJonathan se dedica a la crianza de codornices un ave literalmente peque\u00f1a que necesita varios cuidados especiales principalmente en su alimentaci\u00f3n para que puedan conservar su postura y adem\u00e1s para que produzcan huevos sanos que puedan ser comercializados, adem\u00e1s de su carne que tambi\u00e9n puede ser comercializada. En Ecuador esta pr\u00e1ctica es una actividad relativamente nueva y ha dado rentabilidad a muchas personas que han emprendido con esta idea. Los huevos de codorniz tienen propiedades nutritivas y saludables, lo que los hace apetecidos por varios usuarios y lo convierte en un negocio interesante. \nJonathan empez\u00f3 su negocio hace 8 a\u00f1os, aprovechando las condiciones clim\u00e1ticas que ofrece su ciudad, pues Santo Domingo re\u00fane varias caracter\u00edsticas para desarrollar esta actividad. El invierte en esta actividad hasta 8 horas cada d\u00eda; en la ma\u00f1ana sale a recorrer las calles  con un coche ambulante en donde lleva huevos cocinados y tambi\u00e9n crudos para la venta y en la tarde se dedica al cuidado, limpieza y mantenimiento de los criaderos. Por la experiencia que ha adquirido se siente preparado para dar un paso de crecimiento en su negocio, para lo cual requiere un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 para compra de aves y por ende la instalaci\u00f3n de m\u00e1s criaderos. Jonathan recurri\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por referencia de varios amigos y por la seguridad y confianza que le brindaron all\u00ed, agradece por el apoyo.","en":"Jonathan, 24, is a man who did not have the opportunity of completing his schooling but he did complete elementary school and since he was a boy has helped his parents with their work in agriculture.  He\u2019s single and has no children and lives in Santo Domingo Canton in Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas Province.  \r\n\r\nSanto Domingo is located connecting the mountain and coastal regions of Ecuador; it is a city that\u2019s become a commercial crossroads with several sectors in development.  As proof of this, there are many enterprising families here who started out with small businesses a few years ago and now are micro business owners who generate employment.  Studies have shown that all the business for the most part started out empirically and have been well-received by tourists, businessmen and travelers who move from one region to the other; in addition, this is the country\u2019s third most populous city.\r\n\r\nJonathan lives in this canton\u2019s Luz de Am\u00e9rica Parish, a sector considered to be the province\u2019s point of entry.  Because of the richness of its soil it\u2019s become the home of various food exporting firms and this is the area with the largest papaya production, an exotic fruit that\u2019s exported from here.  Because of this, residents in this parish are for the most part in agriculture which is why several of the local entrepreneurs have strengthened their activities with hard work, experience and effort.\r\n\r\nJonathan works raising quail, a small fowl that requires special treatment, especially with regard to its feeding so that they can stay healthy and produce healthy eggs that can be sold.  In addition, their meat can also be sold.  In Ecuador, this is a relatively new activity and it\u2019s produced profits for many people who have gone into this business.  Quail eggs have nutritional and health properties that make them attractive to many consumers and turns them into an interesting business.\r\n\r\nJonathan started his business 8 years ago taking advantage of the city\u2019s climactic conditions because Santo Domingo has several of the characteristics needed for this activity\u2019s development.  He spends up to 8 hours daily in this activity.  During the morning he wanders the streets with his cart where he carries cooked eggs and raw eggs to sell and in the afternoon he works caring for and cleaning the coops.  Due to the experience he\u2019s acquired he feels well-prepared to take a step toward increasing business and needs a loan to buy more fowl and to build more coops.  Jonathan came to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa referenced by several friends and because of the security and trust he found there; he\u2019s grateful for the support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1273795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy quails.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-01-10T20:01:34Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-09T20:01:34Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonathan Saul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":76.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":81.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":95.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":96.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":98.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.11},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.51},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.55,"local_amount":76.99,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":77.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516840},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":81.22,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":81.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068695},{"amount":85.17,"local_amount":84.56,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":85.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494961},{"amount":85.11,"local_amount":84.49,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":85.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524889},{"amount":87.27,"local_amount":86.63,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":87.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133193},{"amount":88.51,"local_amount":87.87,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":88.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313734},{"amount":569.57,"local_amount":565.44,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":569.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565340}],"funded_date":"2013-01-19T02:45:16Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":516063,"name":"Mauricio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mauricio, est\u00e1 casado, tiene la edad de 29 a\u00f1os, vive son su esposa y su hija que son su mayor prioridad.

So, five years ago, she dedicated herself to the production of organic cocoa, which is one of the most profitable crops in the region. Each day, Elsa gets up early and send her daughters off to school before working on her land. She hires some day laborers to help with the large amount of weeding necessary to obtain a good-quality product. Her work in the fields is not easy, and requires much dedication and painstaking attention. Nevertheless, Elsa is grateful to have a way to help her family get ahead. She hopes that she remains in good health and continues to enjoy her work while she helps her daughters to study and become professionals.\r\n\r\nElsa plans to buy another plot of land in order to increase her production and, in turn, her profits, so she will continue to work tirelessly. Currently, she needs the capital of 2,000 Peruvian soles with which to finance the weeding of her land.

He comes from a well-known family in his area and is recognized as being hard-working and responsible. He is single and has the beautiful responsibility of his 2 year old, Cristofer. They live in a modest house which they rent. After finishing his secondary studies, he started a serious relationship. Together with his former partner, he started to sell grilled chicken from his front door. \r\n\r\nShortly after they separated, and now with the responsibility of a child, he decided to learn how to go about being a day labourer. He still considers this to be his only source of income. He considers his work difficult as day labourers always have to look for opportunities to work and need multiple agricultural skills.    \r\n\r\nNow that it's the rainy season, he is sowing and grafting in the cocoa plantations as well as weeding the plots alongside his colleagues.

Completing this happy family is their small son Angelo, who is 2 years old.  They currently share their family experiences in a home made of wood that was given to them by their parents.  Feeling that agricultural activities would be too rigorous for her, she chose to start a business selling clothing for women and children.  She started the business 5 months ago with the financial support of Fredy.  In spite of some difficulties, the business was well accepted from the start by her neighbors, and later she started going out to homes in the surrounding areas to offer her garments for sale.\r\n\r\nShe's been developing her business with a lot of enthusiasm in the company of her little one.  This line of work has always been to her liking, and she feels she has a vocation for sales.\r\n\r\nAmong the problems she faces are the late payments she receives from some of her customers, to whom she has delivered merchandise on credit.  This creates problems for her when she goes to balance her accounts.\r\n\r\nFor the future, she plans to continue to work with the enthusiasm she is known for so that she can achieve one of her long term goals: to open a much bigger business where she could sell all types of clothing.  At this time, she requests 3,000 Peruvian soles to buy merchandise to stock her business with ladies clothing, specifically pants and fashionable tops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1274030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy pants and fashionable tops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-10T23:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-09T23:00:16Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inaydina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":328.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":349.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":361.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":356.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":385.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":387.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":410.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":420.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.97},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.03},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":131.35,"local_amount":328.37,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":335.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573217},{"amount":139.97,"local_amount":349.92,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":357.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122869},{"amount":144.57,"local_amount":361.43,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":368.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868691},{"amount":142.77,"local_amount":356.93,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":364.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577527},{"amount":154.03,"local_amount":385.08,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":393.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529762},{"amount":155.03,"local_amount":387.56,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":395.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974793},{"amount":164.2,"local_amount":410.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":418.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996084},{"amount":168.08,"local_amount":420.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":428.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863702}],"funded_date":"2013-01-19T13:58:33Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":516109,"name":"Faataitaia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faataitaia is a 21-year-old married woman with one child.

Her son sometimes helps her sell but she usually works alone.  She likes her business because she\u2019s been able to raise her children by means of it and to support them throughout their youth.  She learned this activity thanks to the encouragement she got from a neighbor and seeing the profits she netted she decided to continue with; it\u2019s her main source of work.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to continue forward and to save money that will take her through a worry-free old age.

","en":"Roza is 62 years old and is widowed.  She lives with her son.  As the main source of income for her family, Roza has been raising livestock since 1969, having started this business with 7,000 som (KGS).  Today she has four cows, four bulls, four stallions and ten sheep on her farm.  Raising and reselling livestock brings her 9,000 som (KGS) per month.

As a main source of income for her family, Anarkul has over the last year been engaged in livestock breeding, after having started this business with a sum of 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to persistent work, Anarkul currently has two calves and ten heads of sheep and goats on her farm.

As a result, the house heating system can be updated and the family can live in a more comfortable and warm place.

","en":"Furkat is a 48 years old man. He has a large family, with five children. He works with livestock breeding and has bred cattle from a young age. His wife and children help him in this business. To improve life, he plans to take a green loan and purchase an energy efficient furnace, as this stove is multifunctional and heats the room in the winter cold. It is possible to prepare food on it and in the oven it is possible to bake cakes and pies. In addition, this oven does not harm the health. \r\n\r\nFurkat is very happy that he will have the opportunity to purchase such a stove. They live in the countryside, and therefore such a choice was necessary to them, so that there is enough wood and coal. Furkat and his family are very thankful to Kiva for the opportunity to realize their plans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1273675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

She lives with her spouse, Richard, 41, with whom she has two minor children, Yeni, 14, and Richard, 8.  She lives with her family in a house of her own where she daily offers the best to her family since she wants to give them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nOdalis\u2019 work consists in buying and selling vehicles.  She opens her business that\u2019s home-based every day.  It\u2019s located on a corner with much vehicular traffic and people of all sorts.  She waits for her customers to arrive there or she goes out seeking them out which is quite usual for her to do because she doesn\u2019t like to sit idly by with no activity.  At the moment of carrying out a transaction she\u2019s very careful to have all documents in order and that the vehicles are in optimum condition and operating well in order not to have any future problems with her buyers.  She\u2019s been in this business six years and does it alongside her spouse who is in charge of repairing all the vehicles they put up for sale.\r\n\r\nShe likes what she does because it allows her to earn good income.  Sometimes she earns a high profit margin and sometimes only enough to cover daily expenses but she\u2019s always highly motivated and has a smile for everyone who approaches to ask the price of any of the vehicles she sells.  She hopes to be able to continue working and to gradually grow and later on open a new vehicle store.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #7 and she thanks all those who make the loan possible so she can continue towards her objectives and programmed growth.  She\u2019s also quite determined once again to make her payments punctually like she\u2019s done up to now in all her previous loans.  She very much enjoys being part of her group because she realizes that all the embers who participate in it are very punctual, responsible people.  She will use the requested 3,000 soles to buy two vehicles to repair and put up for sale at affordable prices and to continue with her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1274694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy two vehicles to repair and put into service.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-11T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-10T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Odalis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":448.46},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":477.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":495.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":498.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":532.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":548.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":179.38,"local_amount":448.46,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":457.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573226},{"amount":190.95,"local_amount":477.37,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":487.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122883},{"amount":198.07,"local_amount":495.18,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":505.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868705},{"amount":199.46,"local_amount":498.64,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":508.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577542},{"amount":212.9,"local_amount":532.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":543.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529775},{"amount":219.24,"local_amount":548.11,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":559.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974806}],"funded_date":"2013-01-14T00:32:24Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":516332,"name":"Analisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Analisa, age 45, runs a general store business where she sells such items as noodles and canned goods to earn a living.

He also raises animals like chickens, ducks, cows, etc.  He does this work on his boss\u2019s land since he\u2019s his employee and in return is allowed to use the estate\u2019s land to plant his own crops and to raise his animals.  He does his work alone and only when necessary hires some day laborers to help him with the planting.\r\n\r\nHe enjoys his work very much because he\u2019s always out in nature and also has free time for many other activities.  He hopes to keep producing and to be able to later on buy his own agricultural estate where he can work growing his crops and raise his animals.\r\n\r\nThis is his 10th MFP loan.  He\u2019s always been a good member of his communal bank where he\u2019s very well-liked because he\u2019s very responsible and supportive.

He\u2019s convinced that he\u2019ll continue to be a very punctual member and will pay all his installments on time like he\u2019s done with all the previous loans he\u2019s had.  He will use the requested 2,500 soles to buy grain and some manioc plants and he will also pay for some laborers to help him with the planting which is a bit hard work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1274711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy farm supplies and hire day laborers to help with the heavy tasks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-11T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-10T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":269.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":268.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":299.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":310.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":322.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":328.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":343.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":355.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":107.81,"local_amount":269.52,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":275.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573229},{"amount":107.41,"local_amount":268.53,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":274,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122886},{"amount":119.9,"local_amount":299.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":305.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868708},{"amount":124.37,"local_amount":310.92,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":317.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577545},{"amount":129.01,"local_amount":322.52,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":329.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529778},{"amount":131.58,"local_amount":328.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":335.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974809},{"amount":137.59,"local_amount":343.96,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":350.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996093},{"amount":142.33,"local_amount":355.83,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":363.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863709}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T18:13:14Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":516352,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vilma is 47 years old, married, and has four children, two of whom attend school.

He lives alone in his own house where his sisters and son sometimes come to visit him or spend a weekend. \r\n\r\nMirson's work consists in the planting of regional crops such as yucca, plantain, tomatoes, cilantro, and more. He also has a few heads of cattle. Every day he gets up very early to do his work such as cultivating his crops, fumigating pests, and extracting fresh milk from his cattle. All of these activities take place on his small farm, located a few kilometres from his house. Mirson has spent more than 15 years doing this work so that his child could be independent. He has a few other plots of land, and sometimes he contracts workers to help him but only during planting and harvest. \r\n\r\nHe really likes his work because it is always outside and he can use his time in the way he thinks is best. What's more he says that there is nothing better than being independent. He hopes that he can maintain his business and keep working on it a few years more.

She works without rest from Monday through Sunday because this way she'll get good results.\r\n\r\nOn a par with her growth, she confronted a new challenge, got married, and started a family, which is now strengthened with the arrival of her first child.

He is 32 years old.  He is married and has two young children.  He made the decision to look for work so his son could continue his education and to get ahead.  As he could not find work at a business, he decided to use the money he had to start a taxi business.  Currently, his business has grown little by little to the point where he gets enough passengers.

She lives with her partner, 38-year-old F\u00e9lix.  She is the mother of three young children, Emerson, Erica, and Ruth.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her family in a house made of fine materials that she built with the help of her partner.  She learned the business of growing organic cacao when she was very young and, with the passage of time, she has been able to make it the primary source of support for her household.  For over 10 years she has been an independent grower on some plots of land she got with F\u00e9lix in order to ensure reliable support for her household. \r\n\r\nShe likes her work very much, as she is used to spending many hours in the field doing the daily tasks alongside the laborers she hires so the work goes smoothly.  Nevertheless, rainy days keep her from getting to her land, as access to it becomes very unstable because of mud.  \r\n\r\nShe plans to improve her yield by replacing cacao trees that are out of phase and using their stalks to start making grafts.  In order to do this, she needs capital to buy gumbo-limbo plants.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are all directed toward buying a cargo vehicle, which she hopes will make transporting her produce to the place she sells to collectors easier.  For this season, she needs 1,000 nuevos soles to buy gumbo-limbo plants and guano fertilizer in hopes of replacing her out-of-phase crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1274803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy gumbo-limbo plants and bird-guano fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-11T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-10T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":109.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":116.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":120.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":118.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":136.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":109.43,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":111.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573234},{"amount":46.65,"local_amount":116.62,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122891},{"amount":48.18,"local_amount":120.45,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":122.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868713},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":118.96,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":121.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577550},{"amount":51.34,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":130.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529783},{"amount":51.66,"local_amount":129.16,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":131.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974814},{"amount":54.73,"local_amount":136.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":139.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996098},{"amount":56.09,"local_amount":140.23,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":143.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863714}],"funded_date":"2013-01-13T02:10:22Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":516405,"name":"Garnik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Garnik is 57 years old, and lives in Ararat town.

He specializes in gypsum decorations and has gained a fair number of clients asking for his services. Regardless of being satisfied with what he has attained so far, he suffers from a bad financial situation. That is the reason why he is asking today for a youth loan from Kiva Partner Ameen s.a.l. He will use the loan to improve his business by purchasing a new car, as he plans to take on bigger projects all over the surrounding areas. \r\n\r\nIn the near future, he plans to take additional loans to open his own gypsum boards shop.

Also, many times the supplies she needs are scarce. \r\n\r\nGabriela is a very hardworking person and is happy and grateful to the institution for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1274820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2013-01-11T23:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-10T23:20:14Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Gabriela Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":284.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":358.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":358.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":374.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":394.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":411.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":425.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":444.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":462.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":485.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.72,"local_amount":284.79,"processed_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":295.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347060351},{"amount":53.76,"local_amount":358.42,"processed_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":371.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355805694},{"amount":53.76,"local_amount":358.38,"processed_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":371.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364513619},{"amount":56.12,"local_amount":374.11,"processed_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":387.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372918804},{"amount":59.13,"local_amount":394.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":408.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381696555},{"amount":61.66,"local_amount":411.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":425.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390559274},{"amount":63.88,"local_amount":425.9,"processed_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":441.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399808289},{"amount":66.69,"local_amount":444.61,"processed_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":460.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410084323},{"amount":69.42,"local_amount":462.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:29:30Z","rounded_local_amount":479.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419850868},{"amount":72.86,"local_amount":485.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":503.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430394980}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T10:35:47Z","paid_date":"2013-12-21T09:53:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Bohnert","image":851467}},{"id":516417,"name":"Festo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Festo is 46 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda.
