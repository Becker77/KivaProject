She has lived for 36 years in the house that she bought together with her spouse Daniel and one of her 8 children: Dora. Living in the country is what she likes most. \r\n\r\nHer work for 18 years has been in agriculture. She says that it was very difficult for her to begin acquiring her farmland. On the land that she inherited from her mother, she now sows potatoes, beans, wheat, barley, and corn. Little by little she began to gain experience in commercialization. For that reason she now knows, for example, that in the months of May and July, merchants from all over the country arrive to buy the best harvests from different cultivators. For that reason, she cares very much that her harvests are of good quality. This is the reason why her crops are very good and profitable. Now she wishes to continue improving her production of food crops, so she has a great challenge. \r\n\r\nPaulina also makes a living raising cows, of which she has 10, which produce milk that she sells to ranchers.

He lives with his wife Cecelia and their three children: Sarela, Camila, and Nataniel, whom he cares for in the house that he inherited from his father 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, as he has for the last 20 years, Pedro wakes up to care for his plantings of potatoes, quinoa, and vetch, which he cares for with great conscientiousness and patience, since he is a forward-looking man. He owns land inherited from his parents, where in addition to planting, he also works in animal husbandry, raising sheep and pigs. He wants to enter into cattle raising, but he still doesn't have the necessary capital nor the contacts, since, as he says, \"to begin a business, we have to have acquaintances.\"  Thus he is now preparing to raise potatoes, since he has to take advantage of the growing season and thus improve the quality of his plantings, for which he will buy organic fertilizers. \r\n\r\nHe belongs to the communal bank \"Cruz de Espinas\" (Cross of Thorns), and this is their fourth loan cycle with MFP. In all these years of work, he has obtained good results in his business and in his personal life, for which he is thankful. For this reason, he promises to be punctual with his payments.

For 3 years she has been living in her sister's home together with her 4 small children. She has little agricultural land which was inherited from her mother. There she plants small quantities of beans, potatoes, and barley. At times, the food is used for personal consumption and when the price is very high, she sells them in the city of Jauja. But according to what she says, on days when she doesn't have to look after her plants, she works in other agricultural fields as a laborer. However her main economic activity focuses on the care of animals such as pigs, sheep, and bulls which she buys in order to then sell at a higher price to the butchers who frequently come her home because they know of her trade. Presently, due to a lack of funds, many animals are not gaining weight. She hopes to be able to work with her communal bank, and little by little, acquire the funds she needs in order to yield more profit. She belongs to the solidarity group \"las abejitas\" and this is her second loan with MFP.

The development of the business started with a greenhouse, where they grew baby cucumbers.  Elena and her husband decided to purchase plastic for covering the greenhouse for protecting cucumbers and tomatoes from cold and wind, and a drip line for watering cucumbers and tomatoes in the summer period.  Her future plans are to grow the greenhouses, purchase a mini-tractor for plowing and treat the land.  Her personal plans are to complete her house construction and purchase a car.

She and her husband sacrificed their lives to provide their children with good lives. Mariam is a hard worker who insisted on working outside of her home ten years ago.

His 18 year-old daughter, who studies to be an investigator in a university, helps him with the business.  The business development started with 25 hectares of land, where Alexandr grew wheat and sunflowers.  Alexandr decided to purchase a drip line for watering his land plot because it is very difficult to manually water the land during the dry summer period.  His future plans are to install a closed-soil greenhouse.  His personal plans are to provide his daughter with an education and to build a house.

children. All her children are grown adults and are well off and only two of her sons live with her and go to secondary elite schools. Bubu has been doing animal husbandry since 1992 as a main source of income, a business she started with 1,000 KGS. Because of her hard work Bubu now has five cows, ten heads of sheep and eleven heads of goats. Her monthly income from the business is 9,000 KGS from the sale of milk. With the goal to further grow her business Bubu has come to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 20,000 KGS to buy cattle.

les ayuda cuando requieren su apoyo. Est\u00e1 casado con Jacinta de 59 a\u00f1os quien se dedica a quehaceres en el hogar.  Jos\u00e9 vive con su esposa y se esfuerza trabajando duro para conseguir el sustento diario. Viven en la Parroquia de Bombol\u00ed de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nJos\u00e9 desde hace 8 a\u00f1os se ha dedicado a recorrer las largas calles de la ciudad con un coche adecuado para vender granizados que sirven como refresco para los d\u00edas soleados que son muy comunes en la Regi\u00f3n Costa a la cual pertenece Santo Domingo. El trabajo implica muchas tareas; desde recolectar en moldes grandes agua para que se congele, preparar las esencias que dan sabor al granizado y salir a vender el producto. Jos\u00e9 invierte 8 horas cada d\u00eda de las cuales solo en el recorrido para la venta son 7 horas por lo general en el d\u00eda antes del atardecer, horas en las que el producto es demandado. En a\u00f1os anteriores las personas dedicadas a este negocio recog\u00edan el hielo en la cima de alg\u00fan nevado cercano y lo transportaban envuelto en porciones de paja para que no pierda su consistencia. Ahora esa costumbre se ha perdido, pero no por ello deja de ser una labor que requiera esfuerzo. En los a\u00f1os que Jos\u00e9 ha trabajado en esta actividad, su coche se ha desgastado y requiere algunos arreglos y repuestos, para lo cual ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayudar\u00e1 a realizar y estos arreglos y adem\u00e1s en comprar algunos ingredientes para incrementar la variedad de sabores de sus granizados. El obst\u00e1culo con el que siempre ha tropezado Jos\u00e9 es la falta de capital y las dificultades para obtener un cr\u00e9dito. Barreras que se rompieron con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes gracias al trabajo de Kiva y sus prestamistas pudieron brindar a Jos\u00e9 la facilidad y confianza que esperaba.","en":"Jose is 64 years old and completed primary school.  He has six children, all of whom are now independent, though he does help them when they need support.  He is married to 59 year old Jacinta who looks after the home.  Jose lives with his wife and works hard to earn a living.  They live in the Bomboli parish of Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de las Ts\u00e1chilas, an Ecuadorean province that has had high sustained growth in the last few years.  The most attractive and eye-catching sight of the province\u2019s capital is the delicious fruits and the local gastronomy.  There is also a considerable amount of business as it has become a trading point between the coastal and mountainous regions of the country.  It also has various tourist attractions that, along with its hot climate, are popular with national and international tourists.  For this reason, the majority of inhabitants have started up some business for inhabitants and tourists.\r\nFor eight years Jose has worked on the city\u2019s long streets with a cart made for selling iced drinks,  a common refreshment on sunny days in Santo Domingo\u2019s coastal region.  The work involves a lot of tasks: making ice, preparing the essences for the iced drinks\u2019 flavours and going out to sell the product.  Jose works eight hours every day.  Seven of those hours are spent on the street selling his product, generally at dusk which is when demand for his drinks is highest.  In previous years, people working in this kind of business brought the ice from the summit of a nearby snow-covered hill, wrapped up so that it does not lose its consistency.  This tradition has now gone but it does not mean that producing the ice is any easier.  In the time that Jose has done this work, his cart has deteriorated and it needs some repairs and some parts replaced.

The loan will be used to purchase more essential commodities such as milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Sarah to generate greater profits to take good care of herself and her children. Sarah hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business into a wholesale shop and also to open up another retail shop in town. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Jose has always lived in the same town and she studied basic education at college. Jose and her husband Edgar have been selling clothes for 7 years. She says that they began by traveling and selling door to door and it was very tiring for them because they had to carry their bags and if a customer asked for something extra such as kitchen utensils, they had to carry this as well. This time, they are requesting a loan to buy more clothes. She comments that she started the business because, when she got married her husband decided to go back to school and they were building their house so their expenses were very high and they had to find the extra money somehow. And this is how it occurred to them to sell clothes, a business that has gone well for them because now they have loyal customers. They have also been able to buy a van so that now it is much easier to deliver their orders on time. She tells us that she hasn't had any problems to date except when a client doesn't want to pay on time and is late in their payments, but nothing serious. Jose comments that \"My greatest dream, and that of my husband, is to have our own store where we can sell our goods and our customers can find us easily and come and buy from us.\" Previously, Jose and her husband, Edgar, had a store but it didn't make sense for them to pay rent if the store was closed most of the day because there was no one to work there as her husband was working all day and she was teaching at a school in the mornings.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying many pounds of chicken, plantains, potatoes, cooking oil, and other items like disposables. She will use the profits to save and reinvest in her business. She thanks you all for your support!!!

As demand was high, they bought more merchandise and ventured into the streets to sell it.

Se cas\u00f3 muy joven y se dedic\u00f3 a los quehaceres del hogar. La falta de educaci\u00f3n le impidi\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n conocer sobre planificaci\u00f3n familiar, por lo que tuvo su primer hijo todav\u00eda en la adolescencia y ahora tiene 3 hijos de los cuales 2 ya son independientes y ella a\u00fan educa al menor. Y ayuda en lo que puede a sus hijos mayores cuando requieren su apoyo. Su esposo Oswaldo de 43 a\u00f1os trabaja como alba\u00f1il contratista, por lo que a veces cuando no hay obras en las que tenga que trabajar, los ingresos son escasos.  Elsa vive con su esposo y su hijo en la  Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, un lugar hist\u00f3rico de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas. \nElsa al ver la necesidad en su hogar decidi\u00f3 aportar emprendiendo en la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos y bisuter\u00eda desde hace 6 a\u00f1os.

Para esta inversi\u00f3n, Elsa requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el que realizar\u00e1 el primer pago para el negocio de la venta de recargas para celulares adem\u00e1s que comprar\u00e1 algunos productos al por mayor para que reciba m\u00e1s descuentos y poder competir en precio.

","en":"Elsa is 36 years old, and comes from a family of few economic resources. She was only able to complete elementary school, since she got married when she was very young and had to take care of household duties. Her limited education also affected her knowledge of family planning, and she had her first son when she herself was still a teenager. She now has three children, two of whom are grown and one of whom still depends on her. Elsa is married to Oswaldo, who is 43 years old, and is a mason by profession. He works on contract, so when work is scarce, so is family income.\r\n\r\nElsa lives with her husband and son in the parish of R\u00edo Verde, a historic area of Santo Domingo, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, Ecuador. In recent years, the province has enjoyed steady economic growth, and the capital city of Santo Domingo has become known for its delicious fruits and cuisine. As a growing business hub, the area has become a land port of sorts between the mountain and coastal regions of the country. Santo Domingo also boasts a variety of tourist attractions and a warm climate, making it a popular destination for national and international visitors. In this changing, growing culture, many of the native people have taken up jobs in industries related to tourism.\r\n\r\nSeeing the needs of her family for additional income, Elsa decided to start a business selling cosmetics and imitation jewelry. She started her business six years ago, and she travels around visiting her customers and selling various products. Elsa wants to expand her business to include the sales of prepaid cards for cell phone minutes, since her customers have asked her if she could provide that service, too. \r\n\r\nElsa hopes that, with this expansion of her business, she can improve the overall quality of services she offers to her clients. In turn, she also hopes that this improvement will generate additional income to help her pay off debts and free up more time for her to spend with her family. Elsa plans to use the support from this loan to launch the cell phone credit portion of her business, as well as purchase cosmetics and jewelry in bulk for resale, since bulk purchase prices give her the greatest profit margins. She has received a  previous loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, and has a great track record of prompt repayments. Elsa is grateful for this opportunity, and for all the support she has received."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1275210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

They have four young children and live in their own home in a rural area.\r\nEulalia is an enterprising woman. She started cultivating maca, her banner crop, 7 years ago.  Maca is sown on remote and beautiful land throughout the community. In the beginning, Eulalia sold her produce to the intermediaries who would transport her harvest to the city of Jun\u00edn. Three years ago, after seeing that her maca was high-quality, Eulalia was given an offer to sell to a company in the capital that makes drinks out of maca. With that, she began to invest in producing the highest-quality product. This generates her an annual net income of 9 to 10 thousand nuevos soles. Because of this, she is planning to open her own maca processing company. This will allow her to expand her company and generate a better income very soon.\r\nAt the moment, she still sells all of her produce to companies that transport it to the capital city.\r\nShe needs your help to sow a new crop, which she will harvest in nine months.\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de San Pedro\u201d communal bank.

She is married to Joemer, an engineer.  She and her husband manage their household while operating a business.  At this time, she is working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nSusana operates a junk shop.  Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines.  While waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials.  They sell these to junk shops for a small profit.  Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather large quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries such as factories.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 50,000 PHP.  She will be incorporating this loan with her existing revolving fund that is used to buy recyclable materials from collectors.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business and she dreams of becoming a successful businesswoman.  She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her life and business.  She also draws strength and inspiration from their fellowship and from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n \r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, to and pay microfinance loans.

She has requested a loan of 62,400 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to help her buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nLeah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"I heard about Juhudi from a Juhudi officer.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.

Leah owns the following: 'cow, poultry, pump, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

She has three children.\r\n\r\nShe is a farmer and has been doing this work for four years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and a job salary.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"Keeping dairy cows for milk production.\" \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is \"low finances to acquire high yielding dairy animals or improve the existing breeds.\" An animal on the farm has been given the name of \"Tuimet.\"\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 31,200 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied that she knew about Juhudi from a colleague. This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session. She said, \"'How to acquire an asset through credit, use the asset to finance the loan and develop oneself.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked how this loan would benefit her family, Elizabeth replied, \"Acquire another dairy animal to boost production.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Elizabeth owns \"cow\" and \"poultry\" but does not own \"pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.\" \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower does not have \"mosquito net, electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD.\"\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1275618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

He lives with his wife, Dalila, and their daughter, Jimena. For the last six months, they have taken care of Jimena in Fran's sister-in-law's house. Six years ago, Fran took on the responsibility of his family's finances, so in turn, his sister-in-law helps to care for his wife and daughter. \r\n\r\nIn the mornings, Fran works on a tractor to turn up land for some farmers in his region. Over time, he planned to open a small food stand. His sister-in-law used to own one, but it closed when she moved to the capital. Fran decided to open another, similar to his sister-in-law's in order to improve it. This business has gone very well for him. His wife helps him to manage the store. It is the only one of its kind in their town, so they always need to acquire merchandise in bulk. Now, Fran wants to restock his store, since the Christmas and New Year's season depletes it. \r\n\r\nFran belongs to the support group \"Cruz de Espinas\" (Cross of Thorns).

cereales, arroz, pan, huevos, aceite, leche y gaseosas. Compra cada 3 d\u00edas al por mayor en el mercado principal de la ciudad obteniendo sus productos a precios c\u00f3modos lo cual le ayuda a obtener algunos centavos adicionales como ganancia. Tiene su bodega instalada en su casa, trabaja en esta actividad desde hace 3 a\u00f1os y desde que empez\u00f3 siempre ha trabajado sola. Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es que le da independencia para hacer otras actividades, lo que no le gusta es que siempre hay personas que quieren ir a solicitar alg\u00fan producto a cr\u00e9dito y en la fecha establecida del pago, no lo hacen, por ese motivo prefiere vender ahora todo al contado.

She is single and has two children, ages 8 and 2, who live with her and her sister-in-law and her children. Dina sells groceries and essential goods such as grains, rice, bread, eggs, oil, milk, and sodas. Every three days, she buys at wholesale in the city's main market at prices that allow her to make a few cents profit. \r\n\r\nShe set up her store in her house three years ago and works alone. She enjoys that her business leaves her free to do other activities. It bothers her, though, that some customers buy on credit but don't pay on time; therefore, she prefers to sell for cash. She hopes to grow her business, since she feels young, and hopes to keep working as she has done in the past. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan cycle with MFP, and she thanks the people who have provided capital. She likes working with her communal bank because the members have shown themselves to be responsible.

She obtains her main profit from the pigs as she invests little in their food and after being fed and matured, she sells them at a good price.  She wants to increase the quantity of her livestock as she already has a big order for some months of several specimens of pigs for meat.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \u201cLas Abejitas\u201d (Little Bees) and this is the second loan with MFP.

In addition to this food stand, M\u00f3nica is planning to buy an automobile and rent it out in order to generate more income in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is M\u00f3nica's third loan through MFP. She enjoys working with this communal bank group because she knows each of the other members and considers them all to be very responsible and supportive. She hopes this loan will help her to reach her goals. M\u00f3nica is requesting a loan of 1000 Peruvian soles to invest buying plantains and other vegetables in larger quantities, in order to get them at lower prices. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1275906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a bigger quantity of plantain bunches and vegetables at lower prices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-14T16:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-13T16:30:07Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":147.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":166.53},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":177.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":183.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.87,"local_amount":147.17,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":149.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573254},{"amount":63.77,"local_amount":159.44,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":162.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122908},{"amount":66.16,"local_amount":165.39,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":168.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868731},{"amount":66.61,"local_amount":166.53,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":169.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577570},{"amount":71.11,"local_amount":177.76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":181.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529803},{"amount":73.48,"local_amount":183.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":187.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974835}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T16:49:30Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":516972,"name":"Anthony","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anthony lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is extremely fertile for agriculture.

They keep livestock, which currently includes three cows, four mother pigs, 70 chickens, and six turkeys. Cattle breeding is the only source of income for Tsoghik's family, and it helps them to earn a monthly income. Unfortunately that income is enough only for covering the family's basic needs, and it is very difficult for Tsoghik to cover some operational costs. Tsoghik has requested this loan to pay for forage for feeding the livestock. The loan is very important for Tsoghik to earn a higher income and cover her family's basic expenses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1275712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She buys the fruit in bags of a hundred or in boxes, and then sells it in smaller quantities or even one at a time. Her stall is located on the sidewalk at her home.\r\n\r\nLita has had this business for nine years. Jos\u00e9 always helps her with the transportation of the heavy sacks containing the produce that she sells during the week. She greatly enjoys what she does, as even as a child she was taught the value of work and the need to face difficult situations. Her business brings in the income necessary to pay for the basic expenses of her family; she hopes that her economic situation will continue to improve in the days and months to come.\r\n\r\nThis is Lita\u2019s sixth loan with MFP, and she is very happy knowing that she has financial support to be able to continue with her work.

She lives in a house that\u2019s her property and that she inherited from her father.  Natividad\u2019s activity is selling groceries and foodstuffs.  To do so, she opened a grocery store inside her house because economic need was severe and the stipends or child support she got wasn\u2019t enough.  She decided to start this business six years ago and this time has served her to grow and expand.  She has many customers most of which are neighbors who she tends to with help from her mother occasionally.  She considers her business to be quite profitable because it\u2019s well-received and it\u2019s in high demand; it yields good profits.\r\n\r\nShe likes her activity because it allows her to socialize with her neighbors and have more friends and to be able to talk about topics she\u2019s interested in; she also likes to feel occupied and to be a productive person.\r\n\r\nThanks to her income she\u2019s able to cover her household needs.  On the other hand, she does not like it when her customers are late making their payments on the loans credit she gives for her products\u2019 sales.  She\u2019s thinking about not providing this credit any longer in order to have more cash on-hand and invest in expanding the business.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #12 and she feels happy about having this support to make business progress so she commits to make her payments punctually.  She also feels comfortable in her communal bank because she considers the members to be responsible and mutually supportive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1,000 new soles to buy edible products like rice, sugar and noodles, among others to stock up on merchandise for her store thus continuing to satisfy her customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1275934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar and noodles, among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-14T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-13T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natividad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":149.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":165.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":166.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":177.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.78,"local_amount":149.44,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":152.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573258},{"amount":63.63,"local_amount":159.08,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:42Z","rounded_local_amount":162.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122912},{"amount":66.01,"local_amount":165.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868735},{"amount":66.46,"local_amount":166.16,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":169.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577575},{"amount":70.94,"local_amount":177.36,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":180.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529808},{"amount":73.18,"local_amount":182.94,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":186.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974840}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T22:41:17Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":512049,"name":"Jorge","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jorge, tiene la edad  de 44 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado, vive con sus hijos y esposa  que son su mayor prioridad.

and lives with her youngest son who is 13 years old.  She has a high school education and got married shortly after finishing school.  Makhbuba is, by nature, a very kind person.  Her neighbors love her and support her, and they have nothing but positive comments to say about her.  In early 2012, in order to provide a source of income for her family, Makhbuba began selling food products, a business she started with an initial sum of 5,000 KGS.\n\nThanks to her hard work, Makhbuba has a store, and she makes a monthly profit of about 15,000 som (KGS).

She\u2019s been doing all types of work for 18 years and does it alone since her husband works in agriculture and spends much time in his fields.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she can earn money while staying at home sharing her time with her son who sometimes also goes out to work in the mototaxi she has.  Her store is very popular in her neighborhood because she treats her customers well and she stocks everything they need which is why her income is good and she does well in this economic activity.

She and her husband have more than ten years of experience growing vegetables in greenhouses. She grows tomatoes, radishes and cucumbers. \n\nLast year, her husband had a stroke. He was hospitalized and treated in the regional health center. It was very difficult for Vera to take care of the farm and her husband. Now her husband is better. He can now walk by himself, but cannot work. \n\nThis year, Vera spent money both to treat her husband and to heat the greenhouses. Now she is asking for a loan to buy seed and fertilizer. \n\nVera plans to expand their businesses. She has more land where she can build more greenhouses.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1273573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy seed and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-01-14T18:40:38Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-13T18:40:38Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7030.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372947038},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":502.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726578},{"amount":937.5,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":7532.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589706}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T09:42:41Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:44:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}}]}
