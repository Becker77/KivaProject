When it begins to boil, water and salt and pepper are added until the rice is done and ready to serve piping hot, sprinkled with chopped parsley.\r\n\r\nThis delicious product for which Andr\u00e9s is very well known has given him recognition in the area where he has his sales stall.  His wife participates in the process from early in the morning so sales can start at 6 a.m. until 11 on the same day, from Monday through Sunday.  His main customers are workers in the area who buy by the portion and who are increasing every day.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason he's requesting a Kiva loan, his first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it he'll buy rice, salsas, fish, and vegetables, the ingredients he uses to make his dish.  He plans to buy in quantity to lower his purchase cost and earn a little more.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1275911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, salsa, fish, and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-01-14T18:40:38Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-13T18:40:38Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.18,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andr\u00e9s ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":71931},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78509},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80341},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82216},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84134},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86097},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88106},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90162},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":92266},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94419},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96622},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":105197}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.1,"local_amount":71931,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":72550.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071727},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":78509,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":79185.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497942},{"amount":45.9,"local_amount":80341,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":81033.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527755},{"amount":46.99,"local_amount":82216,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":82924.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928503},{"amount":48.07,"local_amount":84134,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":84858.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705655},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":86097,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":86838.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967947},{"amount":50.17,"local_amount":88106,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":88865.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.18,"payment_id":399817141},{"amount":51.52,"local_amount":90162,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":90938.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323420},{"amount":52.72,"local_amount":92266,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:41Z","rounded_local_amount":93060.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082665},{"amount":53.95,"local_amount":94419,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":95232.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062053},{"amount":115.33,"local_amount":201819,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":203557.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731752}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T14:33:40Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":517159,"name":"Lucrecia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

The source of income for the family is the monthly pensions of Viacheslav\u2019s parents-in-law and small salary earned by his father-in-law working as a watchman. Viacheslav has requested a loan from local financial institutions several time but his loan requests were always rejected because of low income and lack of experience in the new business. His current loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. Viacheslav owns a car and plans to serve the locals as a taxi driver but he will charge higher prices for his service because of the benzene price is high. Not many citizens can afford to use the taxi service at a higher price. Because of the above mentioned problem, Viacheslav has decided to change his taxi's fuel system from benzene to gas, which is cheaper than benzene and will reduce the cost of transportation by 40 to 45 per cent. It will allow Viacheslav to decrease the price of the service, which will attract many customers. Increasing the number of customers and cutting his costs will positively affect his profit. He will pay a local auto service center to change the fuel system. The increased income will be used for family wellbeing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1274374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to pay for a fuel system change for his taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tbilisi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-01-14T18:51:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-13T18:51:13Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viacheslav ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":40.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":46.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":46.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":49.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":56.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.69},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.83,"local_amount":40.83,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":40.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115725},{"amount":46.69,"local_amount":46.69,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":46.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861206},{"amount":46.75,"local_amount":46.75,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":46.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570011},{"amount":48.35,"local_amount":48.35,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":48.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968645},{"amount":49.35,"local_amount":49.35,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":49.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749061},{"amount":50.94,"local_amount":50.94,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":50.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612968},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":52.09,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856704},{"amount":53.52,"local_amount":53.52,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":53.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133377},{"amount":111.48,"local_amount":111.48,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":111.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420106995}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T23:03:27Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:34:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":517056,"name":"Caroline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Caroline lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is home to the main campus of Moi University.

He has a business where he offers managed recreation services through exercise in a space at home; he offers individual and group services via aerobic exercise, weightlifting and others to help his customers lose body fat.  His daily work starts very early in the morning and goes until 8 at night when his last group finishes.\r\n\r\nHe started his work two years ago with guidance from a friend who sold him the equipment he now has in his business because he was unable to tend to it.

She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.  \n\nRaquel is now in the water refilling business for additional income.  She would like to apply for another loan in the same amount to buy more wood, hinges, materials, and gallons of water for refilling.  Her profits will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs and to pay for the educational expenses of her child.  She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.  Raquel hopes to have more customers and to expand her business.  She also dreams of giving her child a good education and a good life.  Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their work.\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups which are composed of 15-30 community partners.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Gladys replied 'She will be able to educate her children and feed her family.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Gladys owns the following: cow, poultry, and bicycle, but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.

She is married to Damian, who is 45 years old. With Damian, Zonia has had the pleasure of providing her three children (who are now working adults) with a solid education. Zonia owns her own house made from good material. She used to work selling food, but she recently opted to venture into selling items from catalogs door-to-door. In this work, she discovered her aptitude for retail and a less demanding way to make a living.\r\n\r\nZonia has been selling from these catalogs for five months now and she feels very motivated by the success she has had finding customers with orders to fill.

She is married to Alberto, 49, and together they have managed to get their children an education.  Today their children are grown and live independently, having taken up the reins of responsibility.\r\n\r\nRosa owns a house made of adobe which she acquired through the support of her husband.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years she has been farming alongside Alberto, producing organic cocoa and coffee in the valley.  This has been a great means of support for her family ever since they started this activity.\r\n\r\nThey work just about all year on the various farming tasks, at times relying on the help of dayworkers.  What Rosa likes about her work are the earnings that they are paid when they sell their products to the wholesalers in their area.  One difficulty they have is transporting their products; they are hoping to acquire a small vehicle in the future.  \r\n\r\nIn order to increase their income, they are thinking about expanding their cocoa plantings, since the parcels of land that they have are very fertile and they can produce very good quality cocoa pods.\r\n\r\nOne of their plans for the future is to open a business consisting of a small grocery store, so that they can generate another stream of income in addition to their farming business, since there is a lot of demand for this type of business in their neighborhood.  They are seeking 1,500 Peruvian sole to buy sacks of guano (organic fertilizer), and to hire workers to weed their coffee fields.  They hope that in this way they will obtain, as always, optimal quality products to sell to the wholesalers.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1275967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of bird guano and to hire workers to weed her coffee fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-14T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-13T23:00:04Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":164.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":174.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":180.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":192.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":193.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":205.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":209.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.51},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573268},{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-01T11:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":509.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468241174}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T18:21:46Z","paid_date":"2015-01-01T11:11:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":517129,"name":"Mesrop","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mesrop lives in Por village with his wife.

He has 5 children. Andrew has been farming for 23 years and his primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, transportation services and the salary from his job. Andrew states that the most enjoyable aspects to farming are dairy keeping and feeding dairy cows. His biggest challenges are animal diseases and expensive dairy feeds. Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Maua' and 'Matui'. \r\n\r\n<p>Andrew will use this loan to buy and insure a dairy cow. When asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for the loan, Andrew replied, \"I liked the conditions under which Juhudi Kilimo gives loans to farmers.\" When asked what he learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, Andrew said, \"the importance of using the loans given for the intended purpose.\" Andrew's highest monthly expense is school fees. He says that this loan will benefit his family by providing them with milk and other basic requirements such as education for the children.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Andrew owns cows, poultry, a pump, a bicycle and a motorcycle but does not own pigs or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. Andrew has in his household mosquito nets, a sewing machine, TV and DVD but does not have electricity, solar power or running water.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and sent the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1275858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Her biggest challenge is, 'lack of reliable labor, forcing her to employ casual laborers who are more expensive. She will use the loan to buy a water tank.\r\n\r\nPauline was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Because she wanted a loan to buy a water tank and the terms from Juhudi Kilimo are favorable.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Microfinance can help small-scale farmers to acquire assets for farming.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Pauline replied: 'The family will have access to clean water which she will harvest from the rain.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Pauline owns the following: 'cow, poultry, motorcycle,' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards, based on this loan. This borrower has in the household, 'mosquito net, electricity, running water, TV, DVD,' but does not have 'solar power, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

la cual consigui\u00f3 el apoyo para terminar la escuela primaria, trabaj\u00f3 ayudando a sus padres desde muy joven y se cas\u00f3 ilusionada, sin embargo su matrimonio no result\u00f3 como ella esperaba por lo que ahora est\u00e1 separada y tiene 3 hijos  que son independientes y cada uno tiene su vida definida. Para Blanca el mayor obst\u00e1culo que atraves\u00f3 fue la separaci\u00f3n de su esposo, pues ella tuvo que buscar el sustento para ella y sus hijos en medio del dolor, lo cual fue posible gracias al esp\u00edritu emprendedor de ella. Actualmente vive sola en la Parroquia de Bomobol\u00ed de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nBlanca se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos de manera ambulante desde hace 8 a\u00f1os, actividad que desarroll\u00f3 gracias a la recomendaci\u00f3n de una gran amiga que le acompa\u00f1\u00f3 a inscribirse como consultora de belleza. Cada d\u00eda visita clientes en su mayor\u00eda mujeres para asesorarles sobre los productos que necesitan, adem\u00e1s paralelamente en su casa tiene algunos pollos que alimenta y cuida para su posterior venta. Blanca est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar mercader\u00eda que pueda vender a precios competitivos a sus clientes, pues si compra mayor cantidad de productos, mayor ser\u00e1 el descuento que reciba y adem\u00e1s puede tener los productos en stock para atender inmediatamente las solicitudes de sus clientes. Blanca espera que este incremento en sus ingresos pueda mejorar su calidad de vida y as\u00ed abastecer sus necesidades de salud, alimentaci\u00f3n, vestimenta en el futuro. Blanca agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por el apoyo que le han brindado ya que para ella no ha sido f\u00e1cil invertir en su negocio, justamente por la falta de capital. ","en":"Blanca\u2019s a 49-year-old woman who grew up in a family of scarce economic resources but that was able to support her schooling through elementary school level.  She worked helping her parents from a very young age and married with much hope.  However, her marriage did not turn out like she expected and she\u2019s now separated.  She has three children who are now independent and each has their life clearly defined.\r\n\r\nBlanca\u2019s separation from her husband was the greatest obstacle she\u2019s faced because she had to find a way to support herself and her children amidst the pain which she did thanks to her great entrepreneurial spirit.  She currently lives alone in Bomobol\u00ed Parish in Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas Province, a province in Ecuador that\u2019s undergone sustained growth in the last few years.  Its capital is a city whose most noteworthy and attractive feature is its delicious fruit and the local cuisine.  It also has considerable commerce because it\u2019s become a land port for commercial exchange between the country\u2019s mountain and coastal regions.  It also has several tourist attractions that accompanied by its warm climate draw many national and foreign tourists.  Because of this, most of its inhabitants carry out activities that are commercial or service oriented for residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nBlanca has been working selling cosmetics from place to place for the last 8 years, an activity she developed thanks to a recommendation from a great girlfriend of hers who accompanied her to sign up as a beauty consultant.  She visits her customers, for the most part women, every day to advise them about the products they need.

She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of their work. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He also helps with masonry work when the opportunity presents itself. With his different jobs he has helped his only son with his studies, clothing and food, always counting on the support of his wife, the pastor of an evangelical church. This is his 12th loan for infrastructure. He will finish 2 rooms that he has already started but which lack walls, floors, windows and roofing. In order to do this he needs to buy more cement, sand, cinder block, tin sheeting, and to begin the work himself, taking advantage of his knowledge.

Before working on a full-time basis, he was running an automobile repair service. In 2009, his wife\u2019s brother gave them a house and he has rented it to others since that time. Currently, the family lives in his close friend\u2019s backyard and wants to move to their own house. The house, which was given by his wife\u2019s brother, has deteriorated over the years and hasn\u2019t received any repair for at least four years. So he is requesting a loan of 2,800,000 MNT to install a  vacuum door, windows, and a ceiling and to repair the bathroom. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable place, which will motivate their hard work. Most importantly, the vacuum door and windows are an effective barrier for the upcoming strong storm and frost, enabling the house to keep its warmth versus the economic impact on coal consumption by the family. The family will burn less coal, thus contributing to the efforts against air

In her farm there are coconuts, bananas and cacao. The produce of the farm provides for the children's education, the family's household needs and savings. Ni Nyoman has raised pigs at home since her husband began to work overseas. Her husband taught her how to maintain pigs like in his workplace. They already have considerable experience in raising pigs, and have gotten satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe waste generated by the farm, in the form of pig manure, is a constraint on the growth of the business. Ni Nyoman has taken the manure to the fields to use as fertilizer, but that was not enough to cope with the amount of the waste. When she heard about the biogas digester program, she joined immediately. Ni Nyoman is using her loan to construct and install a biogas digester, which will convert the waste into fuel (biogas) and organic fertilizer. This will reduce costs in the kitchen, and pollution of the environment can be overcome.

She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales daily.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Belen is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy school supplies to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nBelen dreams her business will grow and expand.

In addition, Ketevan owns a plot of land where nuts are grown. She does all relevant agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. The family sells on average 200-300 kg of nuts per year.

They sell the piglets to a wholesaler. Along with these activities, the family has a plot of land where it grows green vegetables. Madona has requested a loan to expand her cattle shed so she can increase the size of her herd and have a place for her animals to stay. The cheese produced by Madona is high quality and in demand in the local market. According to her estimation, when she has more cows she won\u2019t have any problems selling the increased amount of the cheese they produce.

","en":"Lilia is 56, single, and has raised a son. Her son works in construction and has lived on his own for a few years. In 2002, to make money for her family Lilia began her business tailoring hats.  Despite the fact that Lilia's degree is in teaching, she found herself in business. At home she makes hats for men and women. She sells her goods in a space she leases in the biggest market in Kyrgyzstan, called \"Dordoi\". She started her business with 15,000 som (KGS). She had been making has for friends and as special orders.  Today, her business generates about 15,000 (KGS) -20,000 (KGS) per month from selling the hats she makes herself.

en su vida, uno de ellos no poder terminar sus estudios por la falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos, y luego enfrentar el gran reto de apoyar a su madre que por la edad que tiene ya no puede trabajar ni autosustentarse sus necesidades. Esta humilde mujer vive con su madre en la parroquia Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n en Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Adem\u00e1s la visita de turistas nacionales y extranjeros aporta al fortalecimiento de las actividades de los emprendedores que desde hace algunos a\u00f1os han establecido sus negocios alrededor de toda la ciudad. Esta ciudad que es la tercera m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nOleica ha realizado varias actividades en el transcurso de su vida, hace 3 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con la actividad de vender cosm\u00e9ticos de forma ambulante visitando y brindando asesor\u00eda de belleza a sus clientes que en su mayor\u00eda mujeres, demandan mucho los productos que Oleica ofrece. En las ma\u00f1anas y en las tardes Oleica recorre las largas calles de su ciudad para poder vender sus productos sin dejar de lado el cuidado de su madre ni los quehaceres del hogar. Anteriormente Oleica ha solicitado cr\u00e9ditos para incrementar sus ganancias mediante el surtido de sus productos, pero no ha tenido suerte en sus aplicaciones. Ahora lleg\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde sin mucho obst\u00e1culo le brindaron la confianza para realizar un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 productos con ofertas convenientes para que ella pueda ofrecer a sus clientes precios y beneficios competitivos y adem\u00e1s incrementar sus ingresos para cubrir gastos de su hogar y llevar un mejor estilo de vida en donde a ella ni a su madre les falte lo necesario para llevar una vida saludable y estable.

One of them was being unable to complete her education for lack of economic resources and then having to face the challenge of caring for her mother who due to her age is unable to neither work any longer nor support herself.  This humble woman lives with her mother in Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n Parish in Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas Province, a place that\u2019s very commercially active because it\u2019s become the land port for exchange between Ecuador\u2019s coastal and mountain regions.  Also, visits from national and foreign tourists strengthen the business activities that entrepreneurs have established throughout the city the last few years.  This city is the country\u2019s third-most populous and it also has agricultural, animal husbandry and manufacturing activities.\r\n\r\nOleica has been doing various activities throughout her life.

Her current loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages the provision of credit on soft conditions to business start-ups and re-startups for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lali will start up a fast-food caf\u00e9.

It is demographically small, but it has a great variety of sites preferred by both national and international tourists, especially for their ecological activities and extreme sports. It is a city that grows economically every day through its activities of trade, ranching, farming, and tourism, for which financial and commercial companies have established local branches hoping to make use of the economic activity that this small city maintains. In every business, one can find people who have not given up when confronted with the lack of employment, but rather who have set forth with their ideas of business in order to live worthy lives and accomplish their dreams. \r\n\r\nElvira has been devoted to the domestic work of her household, but in the view of necessity and daily-increasing expenses, for 2 years now she has decided to contribute to the maintenance of her home. She undertook the raising of chickens and roosters to then later sell, an activity that she learned from a relative who trained her in the requirements of breeding such as the feeding, cleaning, providing care, etc. Presently, Elvria has learned very much about her business, into which she invests 8 to 10 hours daily, alternating with the domestic work of her home and the care of her child. She is an example of effort and endeavor, since now she will take the next step to grow her business by increasing her breeding grounds and buying more chickens. She is applying for this loan so that she will be able to fulfill this goal since she had not done it before because of a lack of funding and the difficulties of obtaining it. Now, she turned to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, who--with the participation of Kiva--have offered her more flexibility and ease in obtaining this loan. She is grateful for the support, and also, for the personalized advice that she has received in order to go forward with her business and fulfill her goal of increasing her income in order to improve her quality of life, and in that way, be able to provide her child with the education that she herself did not have the opportunity to attain.

He sells food such as macaroni, butter, cookies, sugar, tea, candies and beverages in his shop. Elvin has four years of experience in this field, which makes him a knowledgeable and skilled person.\r\n\r\nThe food products he sells are very popular and are in high demand. His monthly profit is 130 AZN. He sells products from his shop, which is in the back yard of the house he lives in.

For the past two years, AlaaEdden has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and is the only source of income for his family, but he also needs some support to cover costs. The taxi he drives needs repairs such as installing new wheels and repainting. \r\n\r\nAlaaEdden took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN. This loan will help him to repair his taxi and increase the family income. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her husband is employed and gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover all the family's needs.\r\n\r\nAydah and her husband own a taxi office.  They have had this business for four years. It is considered a very successful business because it is located in a very crowded area in Jabalia.  Aydah and her husband are very ambitious; they want to improve their project by buying office furniture and some communication devices to make the job more efficient. \r\n\r\nAydah took out a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN. This loan will help Aydah and her husband to buy furniture and some communication devices for the taxi office. This will help to improve the project and increase the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

However, he tells us that he is happy that he learnt to work.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy agricultural supplies, Pedro must travel with his mule some 1000 metres from his house to the place where a vehicle waits for him to travel to the city, as the place where he lives is difficult to access.\r\n\r\nThe loan which he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy material to build a house from adobe and to pay workers.

He is married and has one school going child. He owns a clothing shop, a business that he has been operating for two years. He started the business through his personal savings. He is also a driver of a public service vehicle. He mainly sells bedsheets.\r\nHe learnt about Milango through friends who invited him to the group and he joined the group with the aim of accessing credit to improve his business operations.

This county is a major center for producing fish for the Liberian local market.\r\n\r\nMasofoe is a high school graduate. She has been selling goods, like palm oil, rice, charcoal, beans, okra and pepper, in the local market for the past ten years. Because she uses a motorbike to get her goods from the bush (village), she really faces a big problem during the rainy season. She is requesting a loan to enable her to increase her inventory before the rainy season.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to build a house for her children, and to grow her business because with it, she has gained her independence.
