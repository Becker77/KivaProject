She enjoys being at home with her children after work and school.\r\n\r\nRamonita is excited to be taking her sixth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing clothes. She runs her business by walking in her community and in other communities nearby. She is Haitian and is a single mother.

She is married to Bernardino, a vendor, and she is a mother to their child. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMiguela operates a market stall. She sells various fruits and vegetables in the community market. She buys produce in large quantities and sells them per kilo. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales, every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of fruits and vegetables to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income, as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMiguela hopes to have more stalls in the market one day, and dreams of giving her child a good and quality education.

They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known from their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating.  Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.  They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In 2001, he began building his two flat mansion and currently completed his first flat.. Due to lack of finances, the second flat and half story are not finished completely. So he is requesting a loan of 6,700,000 MNT to purchase insulation and construction materials at its low price period. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable and warm place because the unfinished second flat repair was the main cause of heat loss. The house was so vulnerable to storms and frost.

city of Mongolia. His wife works as a decorator at a private business entity. He has been working as a plumbing serviceman for four years at a water management agency. He has borrowed money from our organization several times and paid his debt always on time. He is one of our reliable clients. This time he is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to build a barn, which will be joined with their main house. The barn he will build has the advantage of reducing heat loss through the house door. Most importantly, the family will burn less coal and this action will certainly contribute to the efforts against air pollution. Especially this year, when winter is becoming harsh and the family uses an electric heater to heat the house. This electric heater they use consumes a considerable amount of electricity so building the barn is his only solution to reducing heat loss through the door. In addition, the cost of purchasing construction materials is cheaper at this time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1276999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is an active and very hardworking borrower of BRAC Pakistan. She lives in Lahore, Pakistan, with her family. Since 1992, Shehnaz has been in the business of selling milk, which is the only source of income for the family. Currently she is interested in purchasing one buffalo to grow her business but finds it difficult due to financial constraints. Shehnaz has requested a loan of 100,000 PKR from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. This will not only help her to grow her milk-selling business, but it will increase her net income and savings as well. She hopes to provide a quality education for her children. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

They all live in the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nKatherine is a member of the group, and she is standing in the first row of the photo, the fourth person from right to left, dressed in blue jeans, a black-and-white checked polo, a dark turquoise vest, with dark, chestnut-colored hair worn loose, large flower earrings and sunglasses on top of her head.\r\n\r\nKatherine has been working for five years selling used clothing.  She says that she works three days per week at open-air markets, selling women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing in all sizes and different styles.\r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago from clothing distributors that specialize in selling by the bundle and at low cost, which economically suits her business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy bundles of clothing for the spring season.  One of Katherine\u2019s dreams is to renovate a space in her house to install a store and therefore wait on her customers more comfortably.  She says this would generate more income with which she could improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nKatherine lives with her husband and two children, ages 20 and 2.

It is the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region and is the most important city of the Chilean Central Valley.  There is a curious reference to Talca in the Chilean phrase \u201cTalca, Paris and London\u201d.  Among the many legends relating to this phrase, some say it derives from words originally spoken by a person from England, which are \u201cTalca parece Londres\u201d [Talca looks like London], because of the abundant mist that frequently covers the city during the winter season, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4825,"image":{"id":1277437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

No alcanz\u00f3 a continuar sus estudios en la universidad y termin\u00f3 la secundaria. Es madre soltera y ha tenido que salir adelante con sus 3 hijos a quienes educa para un d\u00eda verlos convertidos en profesionales. Ha sido dif\u00edcil para ella afrontar sola su realidad, pero sus hijos se han convertido en su inspiraci\u00f3n para conseguir las metas que se ha propuesto. Yajaira vive con sus hijos en el cant\u00f3n Pastaza ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta ciudad. La competencia entre microempresarios es muy grande, sin embargo cada uno ha puesto su valor agregado para ganar preferencia con los clientes. \nYajaira al ver la necesidad en su hogar y sin ninguna puerta abierta en las empresas por su falta de educaci\u00f3n superior, decidi\u00f3 abrir sus horizontes y emprender abriendo una tienda de abarrotes en el Barrio La Dolorosa, en donde existen viviendas y colegios de donde provienen sus principales clientes. Abre las puertas de su negocio desde muy temprano en la ma\u00f1ana hasta casi el atardecer, trabajando desde 9 hasta 12 horas cada d\u00eda. Gracias a este negocio, Yajaira puede llevar a su casa el sustento para sus hijos, sin embargo, muchas veces no puede abastecer al 100% la demanda de sus clientes por la falta de variedad en algunos productos, los cuales no ha podido adquirir por la falta de capital y las dificultades para obtener el mismo. Ahora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para agregar variedad a su negocio y poder incrementar sus ingresos, lo que le ayudar\u00e1 a invertir en una educaci\u00f3n de excelencia para sus hijos y para salir adelante como familia. Yajaira agradece el apoyo y asesor\u00eda que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa le ha brindado para cumplir su meta de hacer su negocio m\u00e1s grande y adem\u00e1s por la confianza que han depositado en ella. ","en":"Yajaira is 26 years old. In her youth, she has had a difficult life due to limited financial resources and a lack of compassion her household. She was unable to continue her studies at the university, but she did finish secondary school. She is a single mother and had to push forward by educating her 3 children so that they can enter the professional workforce. It has been difficult for her to face these challenges alone, but her children have inspired her to reach the goals she set for herself.\r\n\r\nYajaira lives with her children in the Pastaza canton, in the province of the same name, which belongs to the Amazonian region of Ecuador. The most important place in this canton is Puyo city, located in the middle of the Amazon in the western Pastaza province at an altitude of 924 meters above sea level. Demographically it is a small, but it has a large variety of sites, the more salient of those being eco-tourism activities and extreme sports, preferred by national and international tourists. It is a city that grows economically day by day because of trade, livestock, farming, and tourism. It has established branches of financial and commercial enterprises that try to benefit from the economic activity present in the city. There is a lot of competition between small businesses, however each one has made their value known to obtain customers.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing her home in need and closed doors to many of the city's businesses due to her lack of higher education, she decided to broaden her horizons by starting a general store in the La Dolorosa neighborhood. This area contained many houses and schools which provided her primary customers. She opens the door to her business early in the morning until it becomes late, working between 9 and 12 hours per day. \r\n\r\nThanks to her business, Yajaira can support her household and her children. However, she can not meet 100 percent of her customer's demand because she lacks those products, ones she has been unable to acquire due to the lack of money and accessibility.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to obtain a greater variety of products in her store so she can increase her revenue. This will help her invest in an excellent education for her children and help the family move forward. \r\n\r\nYajaira is thankful for the help, advice, and confidence that Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has provided which enabled her to reach her goal of making her business larger."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1276070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to stock up on a variety of better products for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Puyo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yajaira Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":533.6,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":36.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":41.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":42.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":43.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":48.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":49.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.51},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.63,"local_amount":12.25,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516845},{"amount":24.5,"local_amount":23.77,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":24.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068699},{"amount":85.92,"local_amount":83.36,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494966},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":42.45,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524894},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":43.53,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":44.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133198},{"amount":92.1,"local_amount":89.35,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":92.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565344},{"amount":47.32,"local_amount":45.91,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":47.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814386},{"amount":198.91,"local_amount":192.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":198.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856260}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T21:55:52Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T15:09:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Clemens Mayer","image":1226911}},{"id":518103,"name":"Miguel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Miguel vive en casa propia est\u00e1 casado pero separado de la esposa, tiene tres hijos los cuales ya son independientes, la casa est\u00e1 ubicada en la zona Tembladerani de la Ciudad de la Paz.\n\nMiguel es jubilado rentista, y requiere el cr\u00e9dito para pagar una consulta m\u00e9dica en  oftalmolog\u00eda en una cl\u00ednica privada debido a que los centros de salud de la caja son muy precarios y toma tiempo conseguir una cita.

He considers his business to be profitable because of the good profits it yields and because people need transportation to their places of work every day.\r\n\r\nHe likes his work very much because it makes it possible for him to earn income in addition to the opportunity of getting to know many people and to interact with them.  Also, he can set his own schedule and work independently.  \r\n\r\nBefore starting this work, he had many economic problems so he now has many future plans but for now all he wants is to continue working to save up enough money to buy another mototaxi.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #4 and he\u2019s very happy to know that he\u2019ll have economic back-up by means of this loan he\u2019s being granted because he\u2019ll be able to make some of his business plans reality.  On the other hand, he commits to be a responsible member and to make his installment payments punctually because he wants to quickly enter into the spirit of his communal bank which he has good references of for being very supportive and punctual.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 1,000 soles to buy spare parts like tires, inner tubes, wheels, etc. to repair his mototaxi and service it so that it will be in good operating condition because he feels that if it\u2019s operating well he\u2019ll earn higher income.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1277495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts to repair his mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":149.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":165.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":166.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":177.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.78,"local_amount":149.44,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":152.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573281},{"amount":63.63,"local_amount":159.08,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":161.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122935},{"amount":66.01,"local_amount":165.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":167.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868756},{"amount":66.46,"local_amount":166.16,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":169.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577597},{"amount":70.94,"local_amount":177.36,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":180.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529829},{"amount":73.18,"local_amount":182.94,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":186.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974860}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T22:59:09Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":517980,"name":"Marcus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcus lives in Gardnersville, Montserrado County, the major area of marketing, with his three children and  wife.

County.  He is 33 years old, married, with two children aged five and nine who are in school and live at home. He is a high school graduate and has a certificate in medicine. He worked as a physician's assistant to start this business, where he sells lots of drugs. One problem that he faced is the price of the drugs because he has to purchase the medicine in USD, and now the exchange rate USD to LRD is too high. He enjoys the many cases he receives every day. Whenever he doesn\u2019t go to sell, his customers get  angry with him because sometimes he executes first aid. Most interestingly his business helps to pay his children's school fees and rent.

He is a hard-working and very honest man. He lives together with his partner, Mildre, who has three children, and he raises them as his own children. He lives together with them in his own house, and he wants to give them all the best and a good education, so that they will be prepared for the future. Roberto's work is growing local crops. He takes charge of planting and harvesting on his farm, where he goes out every day to look at his plantings, to care for them, cultivate them and water them. He believes that to have a good harvest, one must put a lot of care into the crops. Recently he also started a business of his own. He works alone, and on some occasions he will contract other people to help him with the planting and harvesting, so that he can have all of his products and his orders on time. He has been doing this work for more than 20 years. \r\n\r\nHe loves everything he does, and in this case where he is getting started, it is no exception, because he enjoys being out in nature, and he doesn't get tired of taking the yuca, plantains, hot peppers, bell peppers and the other products he grows on his farm to sell at the market. In the future, he wants to plant another kind of pepper to vary his production and have more customers. This will be loan number 13 for him with the MFP institution, and thus he is asking for your support so that he can make his plans a reality. At the same time, he is committed once more to fulfilling his payment schedule, as with his previous loans. He also likes being part of his communal bank, since all of its members are very responsible people with a sense of solidarity. \r\n\r\nWith the amount he is requesting, 2000 soles, he will stock the little store he has in his home, so he will buy products and grains, as well as seeds to plant on his farm. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1277522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy products and grains to sell and seeds to plant on his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T19:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T19:10:16Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":215.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":214.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":248.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":257.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":262.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":274.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":286.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.13,"local_amount":215.32,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":219.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573283},{"amount":85.81,"local_amount":214.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":218.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122937},{"amount":95.79,"local_amount":239.49,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":243.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868758},{"amount":99.37,"local_amount":248.42,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":252.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577599},{"amount":103.07,"local_amount":257.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":262.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529831},{"amount":105.13,"local_amount":262.82,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":267.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974862},{"amount":109.92,"local_amount":274.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":279.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996123},{"amount":114.78,"local_amount":286.94,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":291.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863739}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T23:55:25Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":518001,"name":"Gjin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gjin is a forty-four-year-old married father of three children, who are attending school.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Daisy replied 'Broaden the source of income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Daisy owns a cow and some poultry birds, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to

She lives with her nephew, who always helps and supports her. They live in a home they own.\r\n\r\nYolanda's business is sewing, a trade she learned by watching and helping her sister in a small shop, where she acquired the necessary knowledge and experience. She decided to start her own business by investing her own capital, her and her late husband's savings. She purchased a sewing machine, which is her main work tool, and started sewing and looking for customers on her own, over fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because it provides her with good earnings.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it generates enough income for her to pay her home expenses, and also because she likes sewing and making lingerie and all types and styles of clothing. On the other hand, she doesn't enjoy the physical exhaustion that comes from staying in the same position for long hours while sewing her work. But she is not disheartened by this, she keeps working and doing her best to continue moving forward. In the future she would like to buy a riveting machine, which would make her job a lot easier and would allow her business to expand. \r\n\r\nThis is her 21st loan with MFP. She is grateful for the financial support she has received and wants to continue having it, which is why she is committed to paying her installments as she did with previous loans.

In this way he will be able to provide his parents with better quality of life and continue to strive towards making his greatest dream reality: to have a business of his own.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1277551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy building materials and supplies to build a bathroom at home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.06,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":142.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":163.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":177.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":185.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.06,"local_amount":142.64,"processed_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":145.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031862},{"amount":64.13,"local_amount":160.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":163.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776348},{"amount":65.39,"local_amount":163.49,"processed_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":166.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483166},{"amount":68.43,"local_amount":171.06,"processed_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":174.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889203},{"amount":70.99,"local_amount":177.47,"processed_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:14Z","rounded_local_amount":180.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664116},{"amount":73.94,"local_amount":185.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":188.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.06,"payment_id":390775238}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T00:21:18Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":518130,"name":"Salomon Simon","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Salomon es un hombre muy trabajador y entusiasta, vive en la ciudad de Oco\u00f1a, Ciudad que se caracteriza por tener unas hermosas playas, asimismo en \u00e9l se desarrolla la agricultura, en especial el cultivo de arroz, tambi\u00e9n se desarrolla la pesca y sobre todo en esta ciudad se puede encontrar  varios platillos t\u00edpicos en especial el Chupe de Camarones.

Tiene cursados estudios de primaria y espera continuar sus estudios de bachiller especializ\u00e1ndose en enfermer\u00eda. Actualmente vive con sus padres Enrique y Carmen de 46 a\u00f1os y con su hijo de 3 a\u00f1os. Juntos viven en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, su nombre es Gualea, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana conocida como Los Yumbos. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por lo que sus habitantes aprovechan la oportunidad para ofrecer tours, servicio de hospedaje, alimentaci\u00f3n, deportes naturales como cabalgatas, etc. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 2000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos.\nJessica ha sido apoyada por sus padres para cubrir las necesidades de ella y su hijo. Sin embargo al tener desde ni\u00f1a la experiencia de orde\u00f1ar vacas, decidi\u00f3 emprender con este negocio en donde recibe la ayuda y asesor\u00eda de sus padres desde hace 2 a\u00f1os. Invierte en esta actividad varias horas al d\u00eda sin dejar de lado los quehaceres de su hogar y el cuidado de su peque\u00f1o hijo.

Jessica agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y a Kiva por el apoyo incondicional que prestan al sector rural y a las personas emprendedoras que necesitan apoyo financiero. ","en":"Jessica is a young woman of 21. She became a single mother before she reached adulthood. This has been the main obstacle she has faced, since it prevented her from studying. She finished primary school and hopes to continue studying for a technical high school degree with a specialty in nursing. She currently lives with her parents, Enrique and Carmen, who are 46 years old, and with her 3-year-old son. Together they live in a rural parish of the city of Quito, capital of the province and of Ecuador. Its name is Gualea, a parish located in the northwest of the province of Pichincha, which was the site of an Ecuadorian culture known as Los Yumbos. This place has great diversity of flora and fauna, as well as rivers and waterfalls from crystalline springs which attract tourists from within and outside the country. Thus, the inhabitants take advantage of the opportunity to offer tours, lodging services, food, and nature activities such as horseback rides, etc. Another means of production in the area is ranching, with the production of milk and meat, as well as agriculture with the production of sugar cane, yuca, corn, oranges, mandarines and papayas. Crafts produced by hand are also a business opportunity in the area; they are in demand due to the unique use of natural materials, such as seeds from the forest. Because of all this, the local authorities have taken care to create appropriate infrastructure so that all of its more than 2000 inhabitants have access to basic utility services. \r\n\r\nJessica has been supported by her parents to cover the necessities for herself and her son. However, having experience in milking cows since she was a girl, she decided to get involved in this business, where she has received help and advice from her parents for the past 2 years. She invests several hours a day in this work, without neglecting the chores of her home and the care of her little son. Now she is requesting a loan so that she can cover the expenses involved in returning to her studies, since she has always dreamed of being a nurse, and she thinks that now is the time to achieve this goal. Jessica is sure that the sale of milk will sustain her in covering the payments for the loan, without neglecting her obligations to her son.

Munah has been involved in the sales of cosmetics since 2008. She says there are fewer purchases during the raining season. She started this business with help from her friends who gave her some money for the business.

children: Angie and Esmeralda who are 10 and 5 years of age respectively.  She lives in an adobe-based house that she acquired with her husband thanks to much work.  She initially worked doing household chores but she opted for joining her spouse in agricultural work related to growing cocoa beans and organic coffee.  She\u2019s been working for almost 10 years as such and in all this time has acquired much experience related to crop care and maintenance.  She considers her work to be very dedicated because in order to obtain quality harvest she must be diligent about providing the respective care in a strict way constantly getting help from local day workers for the more heavy tasks.\r\n\r\nBeing in the middle of the productive cycle, she finds herself needing to plant plants that will provide temporary shade for the recently grafted plants so that they will have optimum growth and she must also buy supplies like manure and others to guarantee the quality local cooperatives require.\r\n\r\nHer future plans are aimed at building her house with substantial materials for better family well-being hoping to do so as soon as possible by means of her work.  She needs 1,000 new soles to hire day laborers to plant plants to provide shade permanently and to buy sacks of island guano to guarantee a quality harvest.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1277593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers and to buy sacks of island guano.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":109.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":116.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":120.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":118.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":136.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":109.43,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":111.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573294},{"amount":46.65,"local_amount":116.62,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":118.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122947},{"amount":48.18,"local_amount":120.45,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":122.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868769},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":118.96,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":121.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577609},{"amount":51.34,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":130.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529840},{"amount":51.66,"local_amount":129.16,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":131.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974869},{"amount":54.73,"local_amount":136.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":139.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996131},{"amount":56.09,"local_amount":140.23,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":142.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863746}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T04:40:46Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":518091,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamie is 33 years old and lives in Jacob Town, which is one of the cheaper places to live in Montserrado County.

She is the owner of a home constructed from adobe, which she built little by little. \r\n\r\nSince she was a child, she lived with her parents in the country, where she learned the various farming activities relating to the production of organic cacao and other profitable products of the region. She has spent almost 20 years working in this independent manner alongside Octavio, with whom she has the pleasure of working shoulder to shoulder for the well-being of the family.

She lives in a house her parents ceded to her that\u2019s made of adobe bricks.  Since she was a girl she was always by her parents\u2019 side and they taught her to do agriculture chores; in time she inherited the parcels of land she\u2019d grown up on alongside her parents.  She\u2019s been working independently for nine years now alongside Prudencio and she\u2019s become quite a successful grower with vast experience in this line of work.\r\n\r\nAmong the crops that are her highest priority are organic cocoa beans because her parcels are of very fertile soil and they have the best conditions for a quality harvest.  Due to the fact that they are a bit distant from the city she incurs additional costs related to transporting laborers that help her with the heavier tasks like weeding the cocoa bean plants.

Wilson creci\u00f3 en una familia trabajadora y esforzada, dedicada a la agricultura y otras actividades de la ciudad de Portoviejo. Unidos a\u00fan en las circunstancias dif\u00edciles, y gracias a sus padres, Wilson termin\u00f3 la secundaria. Ahora vive solo y est\u00e1 iniciando los estudios universitarios, los cuales planea terminar derribando cualquier obst\u00e1culo. Tiene una casa que a\u00fan no ha terminado de construir en la cual vive en Los Bancos un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Pichincha, una de las provincias  m\u00e1s grandes en la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Este cant\u00f3n se encuentra a pocos kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de Quito, y tiene diversidad de bosques, adem\u00e1s sus barrios est\u00e1n poblados con gente amable y costumbres propias de esta ciudad en donde tambi\u00e9n se encuentran establecidas varias microempresas administradas por los emprendedores que luchan por hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os cada d\u00eda. Otras de las actividades sobresalientes son la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda, produciendo abundantes cultivos que luego son comercializados para distribuirse hacia muchas provincias. Tambi\u00e9n posee varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como cascadas, r\u00edos, senderos, balnearios en donde el turista es atra\u00eddo por los deportes de aventura que se venden all\u00ed con seguridad garantizada. Wilson forma parte de esta poblaci\u00f3n y ha desarrollado su esp\u00edritu emprendedor tambi\u00e9n pensando en ser un protagonista del crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de su ciudad y del pa\u00eds.\nWilson se independiz\u00f3 de sus padres buscando mejores oportunidades de crecimiento y educaci\u00f3n que en Portoviejo no tuvo la ocasi\u00f3n de encontrar. Tras alg\u00fan tiempo de trabajo en varias actividades ha decidido iniciar sus estudios en la universidad, los cuales se pagan con los ingresos de su trabajo que inici\u00f3 hace 3 a\u00f1os; la crianza de pollos; que emprendi\u00f3 por iniciativa propia al ver la necesidad de autosustentarse diariamente. Invierte en esta actividad hasta 10 horas diarias, dependiendo de una agenda que lleva para el cuidado de los animales, adem\u00e1s los fines de semana sale en medio del ardiente sol o incluso en la lluvia a realizar la venta de los pollos a la feria local. Wilson ha adquirido la suficiente experiencia en esta labor, por lo que ahora necesita que sus ingresos incrementen, lo cual conseguir\u00e1 comprando m\u00e1s pollos para criar y por ende ampliando los criaderos. Wilson espera que con este aumento en sus utilidades pueda pagar sus estudios y tambi\u00e9n realizar a su vivienda los acabados que necesita. Para hacer posible este reto Wilson requiere un pr\u00e9stamo, para lo cual acudi\u00f3 a la sucursal que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa tiene en Los Bancos, en donde encontr\u00f3 mucha agilidad, confianza y apoyo a emprendedores y a personas del sector rural que carecen de oportunidades para contar con capital. Este joven luchador agradece la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva para que varias personas alrededor del mundo formen parte sus sue\u00f1os y crecimiento personal y profesional.","en":"Wilson, 22, is a hardworking young man.  He's single and has no children.  Wilson grew up in a hardworking and strong family dedicated to agriculture and other activities in Portoviejo.  They're close even in difficult circumstances, and Wilson finished secondary school thanks to his parents.  Now he lives alone and is beginning his university studies, which he plans to finish by tackling any obstacle.  \r\n\r\nHe lives in a house that he hasn't finished building in Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pichincha, one of the largest in the Republic of Ecuador.  This canton is located a few kilometers from the city of Quito and has a variety of forests.  Also, its neighborhoods are inhabited by friendly people with traditions typical of this city, where there are also several micro-businesses run by entrepreneurs who strive every day to make their dreams come true.  Other notable activities are agriculture and livestock, which produce abundant crops that are they sold for distribution in many provinces.  There are also a variety of tourist attractions, such as waterfalls, rivers, trails, and hot springs, which attract tourists for adventure sports that are offered there with security guaranteed.\r\n\r\nWilson is part of this community, and he has developed his entrepreneurial spirit while also thinking about being a protagonist in the economic growth of his city and of the country.\r\n\r\nWilson became independent from his parents to look for better opportunities for growth and education that he wasn't able to find in Portoviejo.  After some time working in various jobs he has decided to begin his university studies, paid for with the income from the job he started three years ago, raising chickens.  He set it up on his own initiative when he saw the need to support himself every day.  He invests about 10 hours a day on this activity, depending on his schedule for caring for the animals.  In addition, on the weekend he goes out in full sun or even in the rain to sell chickens in the local street fair.\r\n\r\nWilson has acquired enough experience in the job and now he needs to increase his income, so he's going to buy more chickens to raise and, consequently, expand his poultry farm.\r\n\r\nWilson hopes that with this increase in his profits he'll be able to pay for his studies as well as make the necessary finishing touches to his house.  Wilson needs a loan to make this challenge possible, so he went to the branch of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Los Bancos.  He found a lot of flexibility, trust, and support for entrepreneurs and people in the rural sector who lack opportunities to have capital.\r\n\r\nThis determined young man is grateful for Kiva's participation so that various people around the world will be part of his dreams and his personal and professional growth.

She was born in a very simple farming family with many children.  From a young age she was an independent child and she helped her mother to take care of the household. She has a high school education.  She and her husband have raised two sons who have been a reliable source of support since the grandmother passed away.  By nature, Anarkul is a very lively, kind and honest woman.  \r\n\r\nAnarkul has been involved in animal husbandry since 1996. She and her husband started this business with an initial capital of 15,000 som (KGS) with which they bought some sheep.  Thanks to their hard work and their determination, the farm is now very successful.  Beside animal husbandry, Anarkul is also actively involved in agriculture.  Her family now cultivates more than 6 hectares (14.82 acres) of land on which they sow wheat, potatoes and plants for forage, every year. The family's monthly income amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to increase their headcount of livestock, Anarkul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) with which she will purchase sheep and calves.  With the earnings from the loan that she has received, she is planning to increase her headcount of livestock and, as a result, improve the family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":1276406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more livestock for her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Shapak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-01-17T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-16T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.25,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anargul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1057.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":423.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":846.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":211.54,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":10028.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458904},{"amount":211.54,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10028.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495457},{"amount":1057.69,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50143.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426765},{"amount":404.83,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20057.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.25,"payment_id":459019336},{"amount":846.15,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":40114.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178032}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T06:44:19Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:09:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":518260,"name":"Celso","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celso is a 23-year-old resident of Langub, Calamba.

All of the members are from the city of Puerto Montt, Chile. Lorena, seen standing in the second row of the photo in the sixth spot from right to left in front of the window and wearing a black jacket, has made a living in pastry-making for the past 10 years. She says she works at home every day and at the moment is expanding a portion of her home to set up a store. She offers empanadas, artisan confectionery and curantos (a traditional dish from the Chiloe archipelago off the coast of Chile that is prepared in a pit with red-hot stones and seafood is thrown in - clams and mussels being most common - and then covered with leaves and vines). She purchases her supplies from supermarkets and distributors to get what she needs for her pastries and curantos at a low cost, making it economically desirable. With the loan, she plans to purchase more supplies as well as construction materials. One of Lorena's goals is to finish her expansion so she can set up her store and tend to her customers in a more orderly manner. Lorena lives with her husband and their four children, ages 21, 19, 14 and 8. Her dream for her career is to have her own store to generate more profits for her family and to pay for her children's education. She is very content and feels grateful for the opportunity provided by Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza, since it allows her to invest in her business. She says that the training she has received has been essential for her business as well as her personal development, since she has learned to better organize and manage her profits and investments.

He owns 1.1 hectares of land where he cultivates early tomatoes, squash, peppers and cabbage. After transplanting seedlings from the greenhouses into an open field, Vadim uses the greenhouses to grow early cabbage, which he harvests some time in May.\r\n\r\nHe needs the sum of 12,000 hryvnia in order to purchase seeds, plastic film and fertilizers, and rebuild a greenhouse.

As the main source of income for her family, Adalat has been raising livestock since 1985, having started her business by purchasing a single calf for 300 som (KGS). At the moment, she keeps 4 cows and has 1.3 hectares of arable land, where she annually plants cotton and corn. By breeding and reselling livestock, she earns 15,000-20,000 som (KGS) per month.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Adalat has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to purchase fertilizers, pay salaries to hired help, and purchase livestock. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business by buying additional livestock. In the future, she plans to improve her living conditions and carry out repairs in her

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
