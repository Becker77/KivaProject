He tends milk cows and makes milk products such as custard, butter, and cheese to sell at the local market. His client base has increased as he has expanded distribution to other towns; therefore, he is applying for a loan of \u00a21000000 colones to buy two cows to increase production. The income Oldemar earns from this business supports his household.

The bank is located in a community where the main business activities are growing oranges and sugar cane.\r\n\r\nEsteban belongs to Flor de Campo, is married to Maria del Carmen, and has a young son. Three years ago, he set up a bakery in his house because he knew the profession and believed that having his own business would give him the chance to give his family a better life. At noon, he starts preparing the flour and other ingredients to make the bread dough. This allows the dough time to rise before he shapes it in different forms and puts it in the oven to bake. The process takes all afternoon and is finished in time for him to fill his baskets and go door-to-door selling the bread with friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nA loan from VisionFund will help him buy more supplies such as wood, flour, yeast, and sugar to make bread. He would like to hire two salespeople some day so that he can increase earnings and more people can sample his bread.

Kristine is 40 years old and she is not married. She finished the Kapan Polytechnic Institute and is a metallurgical engineer by profession. Kristine worked in this area for six years, but as the salary was small she decided to start her own business. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Kristine opened her own cafeteria in Kapan. The business is small, but as Kristine says: \"It is profitable and enough for living\". Her parents and friends help her in the business. Kristine has many loyal customers who love to sit and have a good time at Kristine's cafe. She loves her business and is proud of the accomplishments she has made in such a short period of time. \r\n\r\nKristine decided to broaden the menu and add traditional dishes; lahmajo, shawarma and kebab, which will help her increase the turnover of the business. Kristine needs a loan in the amount of 1,700 US dollars to purchase an oven for lahmajo and add tableware to the

Thanks to Kulsun's persistent work, her farm currently has three heads of cattle, 15 sheep and goats and two horses. In addition to this, Kulsun processes 5.13 hectares of land where she plants potatoes and crops every year. The income from the business is 7,500 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Kulsun turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase cattle, which will increase the collection of milk.

is married with three children; all her children go to school.

She has applied for a loan of 1,000,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO   to buy more thread for sewing sweaters and rolls of clothing materials. She has been in this business for thirteen years.

He has lived and worked in the village of Syunik for around 25 years with his wife, sons and daughter. Before this, Hayk and his family lives in Azerbaijan, but during the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan he was forced to move back to his homeland with his family. At first, it was hard for Hayk to take care of his family. He admitted that it was easier to be in his homeland, of course, but it was not easy to start everything anew and in this difficult time also find work and feed the five children. \n\nWhen Hayk finished agricultural college, he and his wife started working with farming in the village of Syunik. As a result, Hayk's family now has their own piece of land, where they grow grapes, vegetables and fruit. He also built a small greenhouse where he grows parsley, radishes, onions, coriander, dill, basil, rosemary and similar all year round. Hayk used the income to buy a tractor, which was necessary to him, and further he rents out the tractor to his fellow villagers, which also gives him income. \n\nCurrently Hayk and his family are happy and think of themselves as full citizens of their homeland and try to forget the fact that they used to be refugees. For the purchase of seeds, diesel, manure and approval for spring planting, Hayk needs a loan in the amount of 750 US dollars."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1277335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy seeds, diesel fuel, manure, and approval for the spring planting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2013-01-17T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-16T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hayk","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":730,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":69},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":72},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":73},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":73},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.49,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":93.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364613364},{"amount":656.51,"local_amount":639,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":656.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373009567}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T22:19:14Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:52:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":518499,"name":"Munhbat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Munhbat is 35 years old and lives with his wife and two children in an apartment in Hovd Province of Mongolia.

She always fights for what she wants and never stops until she is successful. In the last few months, demand for her clothing has increased. It is for this reason that Wakati wants to expand the business, buy materials wholesale and employ someone to help her increase output. She has asked for a loan amounting 20,000 KES. She assures us that she will be able to repay the loan, and at the same time she is confident that she will be able to better provide for her family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1278180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to expand her business.

Viven en la Parroquia de Bombol\u00ed, ubicada en Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador con un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Sus varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros.

Ang\u00e9lica emprendi\u00f3 con esta actividad desde hace algunos a\u00f1os ya que era necesario aportar con los gastos de la casa y de la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, pues como madre luchadora, sue\u00f1a verlos a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales.

Despite her wish to become a professional, she was only able to complete secondary school.  She lives with her spouse who works as an employee in a private firm.  She has two children with him who are students.  They live in Bombol\u00ed Parish located in Santo Domingo, capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas Province, a province in Ecuador with a high degree of sustained growth.  Its capital is a city whose greatest attraction is its delicious fruit and the local cuisine.  It has considerable commerce because it\u2019s become a land port of commercial interchange between the country\u2019s coastal and mountain regions.  Thanks to its various tourist attractions and warm climate it\u2019s visited by national and foreign tourists alike.  Because of this, most residents have started commercial or service enterprises for residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica leads the \u201cCiudad Nueva\u201d (New City) group, a group of five people who joined together with the same objective: to find support to improve and grow in businesses they started some years ago in order to improve their and their families\u2019 quality of life.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica works selling casual clothes from place to place.  She wanders the long streets in her city to visit customers offering them the good she has in stock and taking orders for items she can later get from her suppliers.  Ang\u00e9lica started this activity a few years ago because she needed to contribute towards household expenses and help pay for her children\u2019s schooling.  As a dedicated mother, she dreams with seeing her children become professionals.\r\n\r\nDue to competition in her business, she offers low, competitive prices but hopes to get this loan to buy seasonal clothes at wholesale to meet demand from customers who are women, men and children to increase income that will help her improve her home\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nHer friends are entrepreneurs like her.  Darwin, Martha and Francisca raise chickens to then sell and will use the loan to buy chicks and feed for them.

He is a farmer and has been raising wheat and corn for the last eight years, since he is on a pension. He chose this business because it is profitable and fresh crops are in high demand. Raising wheat and corn takes a lot of effort and water. \r\n\r\nThese products are very expensive. People use fresh wheat for making flour, and corn as a fresh and very healthy vegetable. Azerbaijani people boil it for hours and eat it with salt.\r\n\r\nKazim sells his crops in the central bazaar. His monthly income is 300 AZN.

Her mother worked in selling seafood to support her household. Now, Maria is 29 and, thanks to that effort, finished her secondary studies. Also, she has had to assume the challenge of being a single mother that, for the well-being of her two children of 8 and 3 years old, has not hesitated to work every day of her life to be able to provide to her children what is necessary for them to perform their best in school and kindergarten, respectively. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her children in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in the Esmeraldas province, which provides products like banana, cacao, coffee, African palm, and forest products to various cities of Ecuador. Furthermore, commerce is the daily work of the majority of its inhabitants to be able to come out ahead, and even more so when they widened the streets used travel to this canton. This has allowed great commercial movement, especially on weekends, when traders of all types go out to sell their products in the market to potential customers who are usually farmers. Tourism also is a very important contribution to this canton. Its natural ecosystem has a large variety of places to be visited: waterfalls, sweet water rivers, and forests, which have flowers and animals that adorn this city. Each family from this place makes an effort to find all the alternatives to improve their quality of life, because of which one can speak of an entrepreneurial canton.\r\n\r\nMaria has dedicated herself fully to the sale of fish and shellfish for two years.

Instala su puesto colocando todas sus flores en baldes con agua, ofrece a la venta especies como claveles, girasoles, gladiolos, azucenas, lirios, violetas y las infaltables rosas en diversos colores. Trabaja sola ya que su actividad no requiere de realizar un gran esfuerzo f\u00edsico. Lleva ya 7 a\u00f1os con este negocio y le esta yendo muy bien. Le gusta mucho su trabajo pues disfruta de conversar con otras vendedoras al mismo tiempo que ofrece sus flores a las diversas personas que entran a visitar las tumbas y mausoleos de sus familiares, todav\u00eda no se siente realizada, ya que desea poner una tienda dedicada solo a la venta de flores, ya que siente que es momento de empezar a crecer y tener un local propio. Este es el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 4 con MFP, por ello agradece la confianza que ponen en ella para continuar con sus objetivos, por otro lado se compromete a seguir siendo una socia puntual y responsable como en los cr\u00e9ditos anteriores que tuvo, adem\u00e1s desea seguir trabajando con los socios de su banco comunal ya que todos son muy amables y solidarios entre s\u00ed.\nCon los 2500 soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s flores para surtir mejor su negocio y incrementar sus ventas.\n\n","en":"Nerith, 54, is a very kind, hardworking woman who lives in her own house with her husband, Jerem\u00edas, 54.  She has four children but only the youngest one of them still lives with her and she works hard to provide her with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nNerith\u2019s work consists in selling flowers both individually and in very eye-catching flower arrangements.  She works every weekend at a cemetery located 15 kilometers from the city.  She sets up her stand with her flowers in buckets of water and sells such species like carnations, sunflowers, gladioli, lilies, Easter lilies, violets and the not-to-be-forgotten roses in various colors.  She works alone because her work does not require much physical effort.  She\u2019s been in business 7 years and is doing very well.\r\n\r\nShe likes her work very much because she enjoys chatting with the other vendors while offering her flowers to various people who come by to visit graves or family crypts.  She does not yet feel fulfilled because she still wants to have a flower shop and feels that this is the right moment to start growing to have a shop of her own.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #4 and she\u2019s grateful for the trust placed in her so she can continue towards her objectives.  On the other hand, she commits to continue being a punctual and responsible member like she\u2019s been with the previous loans she\u2019s gotten.  She also wants to continue working with the members of her communal bank because they are all kind and mutually supportive.  She will use the requested 2,500 soles to buy more flowers to stock her business and increase sales.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1278584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more flowers to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-17T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-16T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nerith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":372.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":396.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":411.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":426.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":434.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":457.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":149.08,"local_amount":372.69,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":379.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122951},{"amount":158.7,"local_amount":396.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":404.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868773},{"amount":164.62,"local_amount":411.55,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":419.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577613},{"amount":170.76,"local_amount":426.9,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":434.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529844},{"amount":173.73,"local_amount":434.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":442.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974874},{"amount":183.11,"local_amount":457.78,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":466.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996135}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T01:36:54Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":517535,"name":"Sorie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sorie is a 29-year-old man.

He has two children aged 7 years and 9 years. He describes himself to be a social man. \r\n\r\nHe operates a farm and a retail store where he sells tea and cereals. He has been involved in this business for two years. His business is located at a busy business environment, and his primary customers are local residents and cooperatives.

He would like to invest in the purchase of larger amounts of silver and natural gemstones to increase production.\r\n\r\nKadek has been selling through NOVICA since 2006. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I was born into the world of jewelry-making. My parents and most people in my neighborhood are silversmiths. My parents used to say, if you make something, don't use only your hands but also all of your heart. This way everything you make will have spirit. I really want to reach success in life, especially in silver jewelry, because I want to continue the family tradition and also be able to support my youngest brother's education.

He would like to purchase larger quantities of silver and gemstones to increase production.\r\n\r\nKomang has been selling through NOVICA since 2012. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Celuk, renowned as the birthplace of silversmiths. When I was 10 years old, my parents, who are master silversmiths, told me to learn about making jewelry because someday, when I got older, I'd be able to make a living from this skill. I enjoyed creating new designs for my parents. I like drawing and I came up with a variety of jewelry designs. I even earned some money with this. I love this job! The nicest part of my jewelry is the uniqueness of its style. Although it shows an ethnic influence, it's different.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am new to Novica, and I'm really excited about creating more new designs. I'm really happy to receive the micro-credit, too, because this can help me replenish my stock and also \u2014 little by little \u2014 help me to develop new creations. I know it will work and, with time, my sales will increase. Thank you so much for your support, and for purchasing my jewelry. Please know that you are a part of the success I'm working toward.

She is married with four children. Her husband works in construction. The couple is really pleased that they have been able to send their children to school. Two of their children have completed high school while the other two are in 5th and 9th grade. They have high hopes for each of them.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Maria Josefina worked as a street vendor selling food. A few years ago, she took a real step up when she contacted the manager of a nearby clothing store in hopes that she could sell her food there. Now, Maria Josefina is thrilled to have 100 regular customers who she serves daily meals to from Monday through Friday. She rises early to prepare for each day\u2019s meals. Her hard work has paid off and she can count on a fixed monthly income. Her ultimate goal is to be self-sustaining and not in need of a loan.\r\n\r\nMaria Josefina, as well as the other women in her Trust Bank, appreciates the financial support that generous people from other countries give them. In addition, they are happy with the informative trainings that Friendship Bridge provides on relevant topics like budgeting, business management, customer service, women\u2019s health, self-esteem and children\u2019s rights. The combination of a loan and education enables these women to move forward, creating a better life for themselves, their families and their communities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1277569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooking stuff ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-01-18T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-17T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":14300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2385},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-23T08:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2395.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347067551},{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2395.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355813610},{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2395.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364523701},{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2395,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924575},{"amount":304.38,"local_amount":2385,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2395.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701750},{"amount":303.1,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2384.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564155}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T11:38:47Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:09:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Meltzer","image":null}},{"id":518060,"name":"Manzanita Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"l comite Manzanita se destaca por la unidad y el deseo de progresar como grupo, ellas trabajan unidas y se ayudan las unas a las otras.

His previous loan allowed him to prepare his existing greenhouses for the season and to install a heating system.  Although last year brought a good harvest, it also came with its share of difficulties.  Alexander had planned to purchase some land for which he had paid an advance of money, but the transaction fell through, so his business did not particularly grow.  His mother-in-law then gave him her own plot of land with a large greenhouse, which Alexander feels is sufficient for him at the moment.  \r\n\r\nLast winter, he also lost control of his car while driving in icy conditions, so he crashed into a tree.  He had to sell his car.

in weaving accessories and hammocks. They would like to invest in the purchase of more cotton thread to increase production.\r\n\r\nRosario and the women of To'ooneel Ixoq have been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is their story:\r\n\r\n\"We are a group of hard-working, creative and enterprising women with a desire to improve our lives, our families' lives, and those of our community. Our mothers taught us to weave when we were only little girls, and they also taught us how to dye threads with natural pigments to protect our environment. In fact, that is our specialty \u2013 our weaves are done with cotton threads dyed with tree bark, leaves and fruits. We go by the name To'ooneel Ixoq, which in the Tzutujil Maya language means 'Feminine Development.'

She separated from the father of her children, who are 25 and 18 years old and live with her in a house she built in a piece of land she inherited from her father.\r\n\r\nJuana cooks and sells food to go, like noodles, chaufa rice and fried chicken. She prepares everything in the morning and afternoon, and in the evening she opens her stall in the front of her house. Her customers are mainly neighbors and pedestrians. She has been doing this for more than twenty years, helped by her sister. In this way, Juana supports her with some daily income.\r\n\r\nJuana thinks she runs a profitable business, considering the profits and the acceptance among her customers. She enjoys this line of work because it helps her pay for her home expenses, and because she likes to cook, something she learned from her mother as a young girl. On the other hand, she feels very tired at the end of the day because she has to stay late in order to sell everything she prepares.\r\n\r\nHowever, she is conscious of the importance of the business as a source of income and wants to continue working. For this reason, she is planning to renew her kitchen utensils and her stall. This is her third loan with MFP, and she appreciates the loan she was granted. She would like to continue having this opportunity so she promises to pay in time, just as she has been doing with the previous loans. She feels comfortable working with her communal bank and she considers its members to be responsible and caring people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount, 1000 nuevos soles [PEN], she will buy wood to fix her stall, tables and chairs. She will also buy kitchen utensils such as plates, spoons, forks and glasses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1277473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood to fix her stall, chairs, tables and kitchen utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-18T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-17T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":149.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":165.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":166.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":177.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.78,"local_amount":149.44,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":152.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573279},{"amount":63.63,"local_amount":159.08,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":161.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122933},{"amount":66.01,"local_amount":165.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":167.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868754},{"amount":66.46,"local_amount":166.16,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":169.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577595},{"amount":70.94,"local_amount":177.36,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":180.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529827},{"amount":73.18,"local_amount":182.94,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":186.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974858}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T11:58:06Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":518776,"name":"Samah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samah is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\nSamah is a 45 year old married woman, a housewife and a mother to five children.\r\nSamah's husband has a home products store.

Nevertheless the additional profit has helped Natalya cope with this difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe shoes will be in high demand with the arrival of spring even though Natalya sells not only shoes but clothing too. This is why she wants to take a loan to buy a batch of shoes for the spring.

construction business in 2001, realizing a life-long dream. Ron and his wife, Lori, became business partners in 2002. Today, Lori continues to run the business day to day. Lori employs her son, nephew and daughter, making their construction company a true family business. Lori says the best part of watching their business grow has been seeing customers seek them out because they have heard about the high standard of quality contracting the construction company offers.\r\n\r\nDespite their wonderful reviews and success via word of mouth, they have had trouble raising money from banks due to lack of collateral. Now that their local lumber yard has closed, Lori needs a loan to add a storage area to their shop as well as buy inventory. They hope to expand in the near future, deputizing their son and nephew to run the construction crews themselves while Ron and Lori run the office. A loan to this construction company will help them meet these goals and preserve the jobs and vitality of the entire

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nClarissa is requesting a loan for 20,000 PHP, which she will use to buy more quantities of raw materials such as fabric, thread, and other materials for her business.

and a mother of four children, two of whom are dependent on her. To offer a decent life for the family, Suny has been working tirelessly as a rice farmer for more than 20 years. Suny, a second-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), is leading a female group member who also is a second-time borrower to take out a new loan in the amount of 160,000 KHR each. The group leader Suny states that via the help of the previous loan she was able to sufficiently cover the daily expenses and meet the family\u2019s needs. This time, she will spend her loan portion on building a latrine for use in her family. With the help of the new requested loan portion, Suny highly believes that she will be able to create a healthier environment for her whole family and avoid using unsanitary practices.

She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 15,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

second largest city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Before moving to the house, they resided in a traditional Mongolian ger (portable felt dwelling) on another person's land. His elder daughter studies at the university of technology. His older son has graduated from his vocational course and now works as an electrician in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His younger daughter goes to high school while his youngest child attends kindergarten. Since 2006, he has begun rendering transportation services to local people using his own mini-van. In 2010, he purchased another mini-van and paid its' full price in January, 2011. In February, 2012 he rented another mini-van and employed one driver. His wife helps him by executing the role of money collector. This time of year, the price of automobiles is usually low compared with other seasons so he is requesting a loan of 6800000 MNT to purchase a car which runs on natural gas. The advantage of a car which runs on natural gas is that it emits less smoke and generates only harmless chemicals to atmosphere. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who is responsible and reliable. Purchasing a natural gas powered automobile is definitely reflective of his responsibility in all

She'll need cement, bricks, a latrine pan, etc. Pov hopes that this loan will enable her family to have a clean latrine for daily use, so as to improve their standard of living by making the family healthier.

She has been engaged in a hog-raising business for more than 10 years now. Her husband works as a mechanic.\r\n\r\nJuana dreams of making improvements in her hog-raising business. However, she lacks the financial resources to do so. She joined CEVI to gain access to the loan services offered by the organization to micro-entrepreneurs like her.

Her work dreams are to continue with her business and her family dream is to give her children a good education so that they can be good professionals. \r\nShe is very happy and appreciative of the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza as it enables her to invest in her business. She remarks that the trainings have been vital for her business and also for her personal development, as she has learned to organize and distribute her income and savings in a better way.\r\nChill\u00e1n is a community in the central zone of Chile. It's name means seat of the sun in Mapudungun, the language of the indigenous Mapuches. \r\nCill\u00e1n is known as the Cradle of the Country or the Land of Artists  because many distinguished people in the history of Chile were born there such as, for example, the well known pianist Claudio Arrau. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6750,"image":{"id":1278538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy towels, shirts, underwear, kitchen towels, and curtains.

Additional happiness is provided by their two little ones: Franklin and Melissa who are 8 and 6 years of age respectively.  She lives in a wooden house inherited from her parents.  \r\n\r\nInitially she was a housewife but decided to help Leonardo, who works in construction, with family economy by means of selling shoes for women and children.  With her savings at the time and thanks to a stand in the local wholesale market granted her by the city she started out; she\u2019s now reached the fourth year with her small stand.  She feels that the business is growing because it\u2019s become a solid source of support for her family economy and she\u2019s established good friendships with her fellow vendors and neighboring stands.  \r\n\r\nLike any business, it\u2019s necessary to constantly restock it with merchandise which is why she\u2019s calling on her financial institution to buy more shoes.  She hopes in future to start building her house and move her store into larger, more welcoming quarters to increase sales and income.  She needs 500 new soles to be used as capital to buy more shoes for women and children that are in higher demand due to the rainy season.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1279341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more women's and children's shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-18T18:50:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-17T18:50:23Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":74.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":80.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":88.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":89.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.94,"local_amount":74.86,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":76.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573299},{"amount":32.13,"local_amount":80.32,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":81.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122963},{"amount":33.19,"local_amount":82.96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868784},{"amount":33.39,"local_amount":83.49,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577625},{"amount":35.38,"local_amount":88.44,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":90.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529856},{"amount":35.97,"local_amount":89.93,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":91.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974886}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T19:13:57Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":518987,"name":"Dyrle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Dyrle, 39, resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines.

To date, her homestead of cows and sheep brings in about 7,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy and meat products. In her household, Symbat has one dairy cow, three heads of cattle, and four sheep. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Symbat appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy two calves for fattening.

She shares her family life in a house made of substantial building materials.  When she finished building her house, she decided to go into the hotel and room rental business two years ago.  She had doubts at first about how to manage her business so she initially leased it out to third parties and eventually took hold of the reins of her business and worked to make it grow.   She must be watchful even at dawn to receive travelers and other visitors.  Despite this she feels good with her business because it allows her to be by her daughters almost all the time.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out some improvements to her establishment she\u2019s thinking about repainting and repairing some of the rooms with help from a master construction worker in order to maximize quality of service.  Her future plan is aimed at building a similar hotel in the regional capital where she plans to relocate to provide her little ones with quality higher education.

Por lo contrario, no le gusta cuando algunas veces no consigue vender todos sus productos en el tiempo establecido, sobre todo las verduras que perecen en poco d\u00edas ocasion\u00e1ndole perdida en su inversi\u00f3n, pero eso no la desanima y realiza mejor los c\u00e1lculos de sus ventas para comprar lo necesario y evitar que se descompongan.  Adem\u00e1s tiene planes de continuar y hacer crecer su negocio buscando incrementar sus ventas. Con el monto solicitado de 2000 nuevos soles, los invertir\u00e1 en la compra de pl\u00e1tanos, verduras y otros productos como arroz, huevos, aceites y az\u00facar.\n\n","en":"Ofelia is 56 years old, kind, hardworking and has a strong desire to get ahead.  She is married to Te\u00f3filo, with whom she has four children.  Te\u00f3filo works as a nursing technician.  She lives with her husband, three daughters and three grandchildren in her own home that she bought with her husband.\r\n\r\nOfelia\u2019s business is selling groceries.  She sells vegetables, plantains, eggs, bread, flour, rice, oil and sugar, among other things.  She operates her business from a stall built on the fa\u00e7ade of her home.  From here she waits on each one of her customers in a very kind and friendly manner.  Her daughter helps her with the business, which Ofelia has been running now for six years.  She considers her business a success because it has helped her out of her financial difficulties and has allowed her to help her husband with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it allows her to be in her home and look after her children and grandchildren.  On the other hand, she has not liked the few times that she has not been able to sell all of her products before they spoiled \u2013 especially vegetables that perish in a few days \u2013 causing her to lose her investment.  But this has not discouraged her, and instead she has more carefully calculated her sales so that she can buy only what is necessary and therefore avoid that any products go bad before being sold.\r\n\r\nOfelia plans to continue to grow her business by looking for ways to increase her sales.  With the requested amount of 2000 PEN, she will buy plantains, vegetables and other products such as rice, eggs, oil and sugar.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1279241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy plantains, vegetables and other products such as rice, eggs, oil and sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-18T19:21:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-17T19:21:14Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ofelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":298.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":317.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":329.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":341.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":347.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":364.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":119.36,"local_amount":298.41,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":303.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122954},{"amount":127.07,"local_amount":317.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":323.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868776},{"amount":131.81,"local_amount":329.52,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":335.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577616},{"amount":136.72,"local_amount":341.81,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":347.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529847},{"amount":139.12,"local_amount":347.78,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":354.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974877},{"amount":145.92,"local_amount":364.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":371.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996138}],"funded_date":"2013-01-18T21:47:10Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":518981,"name":"Abasi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abasi is a forty-seven-year-old man with four children living in Bundibugyo, Uganda.
