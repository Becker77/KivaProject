They live together in their own home located in a farming and livestock area. \r\n\r\nKety is a young mother with great determination and courage for work. 19 years ago she decided to dedicate herself to farming on the plots that her parents bestowed upon her. Now she also raises livestock, making the most of the good pastures of her settlement, thanks to the altitude.\r\n\r\n\"I have more than 50 rams, which I raise on high ground. When they are grown I sell them or I slaughter them\", she says. She earns a considerable income from the sale of the meat, the skin, the offal, and other things; she sells these at a makeshift stall at her district market. \r\n\r\nKety has high hopes, among these is to extend her farm land and improve the breed of her animals. For now she will work on raising more sheep, to continue her meat business. \r\n\r\nShe asks for your support in order to purchase 5 sheep, which she will fatten for their later sale. \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.

city of Mongolia. The family resides in a house on a plot of land. His wife runs her own tailoring business. His daughters go to high school and the elder one will graduate this summer. Since 1997, he has been selling sub products such as sheep intestine, legs and head and providing a taxi service to local people. In January 2012 he purchased a Hyundai Porter, a light truck, which he uses to transport livestock to the sausage factory.

He is married and has four children, ages 35, 31, 28 and 26. Two are in school. In 2001, Shola established his spare parts business. He began his business just to enable him to adequately care for his family. His business is located in the heart of town and he serves mostly men (drivers). Working 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about 700,000 leones (SLL) every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShola would like a loan of 6,250,000 SLL.

homelessness is mental illness. So with her education in psychology, she opened her business to aid them.\r\n\r\nHer practice with the homeless ended in October, 2012, when Kristi decided to work with families who have members with psychotic disorders. She also transitioned to offer a flexible schedule allowing weekend and evening meetings.\r\n\r\nKristi describes her practice as a small one with a handful of clients whom she helps rid themselves from their psychotic symptoms, become more sociable and simply have a regular life.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the Small Business Administration in Shreveport, Kristi applied for a loan with Accion Texas Inc., which she used to furnish her new office. In the past, Kristi worked out of her home, but she says an extra office made it easier to concentrate, since she is no longer distracted by her two children, who are 8 and 2 years of age. She also purchased educational curriculum to study more on psychotic disorders.\r\n\r\nWithout the assistance of an Accion loan, Kristi says she wouldn\u2019t have been able to help as many people as she does now. She used to see four patients but is now able to see 10, more than doubling her services.

family of farmers in the city of Osh. He completed school and became a meteorologist. Isman has six children - three sons and three daughters. Four of his six children are grown and work in various fields, while two of his children are still in school. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, Isman's family decided to start a farm. Thus, they began breeding cattle. Hard work and tireless effort helped Isman develop his business. His 8,000 som monthly profit from the business allowed him to educate his children and pay for his family's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nIsman's youngest children are currently living with him. Together with their mother, his children help him with the farm. Today Isman owns 54 heads of sheep and goats. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing his overall head of sheep and goats, Isman turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a 100,000 som loan. Isman dreams of one day marrying his son and helping him build a home. In the future, he would like to give his youngest children a university education.

","en":"Esanboi is a 45-year-old married man with four children. He is a very hardworking person and a good family man. \r\n\r\nEsanboi has worked in agricultural production for almost 20 years. He grows turnips and radishes. Additionally, he and his family fatten and sell livestock. Esanboi purchases the livestock at the market, fattens them over time, and then resells them at the same market. His income from livestock fattening is larger than from agricultural production, but he tries to both grow vegetables and fatten livestock because he is in real need of money. \r\n\r\nEsanboi plans to use his loan to purchase both livestock and feed. He would like to increase his overall head of livestock and expand his business. He thanks Kiva for the financial support and understanding.

","en":"Abror is an elderly man of 62. He is married and has four children. Three of his children already have their own families, but he cannot get married because he is short of money. Abror himself is a carpenter, and he also raises cotton and onions. But everything he earns is just enough for him to get by. Despite his age, Abror is a very energetic and industrious man. His son is now grown up and it is time for him to get married. So Abror has turned to Arvand for financial assistance. Abror plans to host his son's event and buy him a wedding dowry. He eagerly looks forward to receiving help and support from Kiva and thanks them in

She and her husband are working hard to generate income for their family.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another PHP 30,000 loan to pay for fish needed for her business. More items to sell will result in higher profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and pay the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nSenia hopes that her business will grow and dreams of providing a good education and future for her children. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Filipino.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The renovated house can provide a comfortable and warm place for the family, which will burn less coal in winter time.

Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education, in their personal, household and business expenditures. Over the years, she was able to add other inventory such as electronic loads, mineral water and processed food.  Her businesses are continuously growing as she and her husband work hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result of a better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAnnalyn hopes that her variety store will become a grocery store. She dreams that her children will finish their studies and will receive more blessings this year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He is a father of four children. Younes works two jobs. For part of the day, he is an employee who earns a low salary. For the rest of the day, he works as a taxi driver. These two incomes help somehow to provide the family with better conditions. The taxi Younes drives needs some maintenance and repairing.\r\n\r\nYounes took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a new engine for the taxi and to make necessary repairs such as installing new wheels. This will increase the taxi's capacity to work extra hours and enable Younes to take additional requests, which will improve the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nYounes appears in the photo beside his taxi. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
