The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

living in Smaong village in Takeo province, is requesting a loan. Mrs. Srey Roth K. is the village bank president who has been selected by the members. She is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice. In this plantation she faces an obstacle because her field has infertile soil which badly affects her crop. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field. Her husband, Mr.  Ev Mei, is a driver who gets little salary. Mrs. Srey Roth K. is 30 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom stays at home while another attends the local school.  The youngest one is too young to work or study. \r\n<p>\r\nFive members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":389298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field.

B. is a 39-year-old mother of two who lives in San Jose, located in the central valley of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nIrene has worked in sales over the past ten years. She is a busy entrepreneur who earns a living by selling various products including shoes, catalogue products, jewelry, perfumes and cosmetics. Irene\u2019s goal is to expand her shoe selling business; she plans to use this loan to increase her shoe inventory.\r\n\r\nIrene makes sales over the phone and by visiting individual clients in her community. She also sells products to her children\u00b4s teachers and other members of her community. Through word of mouth, her client base has grown. Irene\u00b4s goal is to have her own store where she would be able to sell various products in order to maintain her diverse client base.\r\n\r\nA main obstacle for Irene is economic and she says she could double her sales with more working capital. She hopes that this loan will help accomplish just that. Another challenge has been clients who are late on payments or refuse to pay. To overcome this obstacle, she has created flexible payment schedules for some of her clients. For example, instead of one payment, a client is allowed to make a number of smaller payments.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Irene is taking guitar lessons and hopes that this activity will one day become a source of income. She says that she is happy places like Fundacion Mujer exist - organizations that support small businesses like hers. The loan process has been a large step up for Irene. It has opened doors and opportunities for her and her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":493821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy more shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Jos\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T19:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":19239.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":19560.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":19886.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20217.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20554.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20897.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21245.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21599.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":21959.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":22325.36},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":22697.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":23075.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":23460.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":23851.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":24248.86},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":24653.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25063.89},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25465.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.51},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.14},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34.87,"local_amount":19239.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":19308.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913489},{"amount":35.45,"local_amount":19560.04,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":19630.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678097},{"amount":33.91,"local_amount":18707.1,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:14Z","rounded_local_amount":18774.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712570},{"amount":38.91,"local_amount":21464.94,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":21541.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047929},{"amount":5.16,"local_amount":2848.1,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2858.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411538},{"amount":25.55,"local_amount":14097.11,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":14147.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148737},{"amount":551.15,"local_amount":304083,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":305172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614313}],"funded_date":"2010-02-24T03:08:27Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":183260,"name":"Blanca Estrella Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este banco comunal es llamado \u201cBlanca Estrella\u201d y est\u00e1 conformado por 15 socios, pertenecientes a la ciudad de Talca.

","en":"Raymunda, who is 46 years old, lives with her husband Guillermo (46) and their 6 children, together in their own house. A long time ago, Raymunda worked for a coffee grower, and received a good wage, but her ideas were not taken into account. After some years she ventured into agricultural activities, specifically the production and marketing of coffee, coca and cocoa. This allows her to make her own decisions, and since then she has had good results. In addition, her customer base is growing, and consequently her income is stable. This is due to her constant work, along with her partner, and the support of their workers. Usually she sells her cocoa, coffee and coca to merchants. She works Monday to Saturday, from 7 in the morning to 6 in the evening. Her plan for the future is to continue betting on agriculture, and she wants to buy more farmland with the intent of increasing her agricultural production. This is her first loan with MFP, and she pledges to meet her repayment obligations. She feels empowered by her communal bank, since its members have given her a lot of help. Raymunda plans to invest the requested money in maintaining her farm products with the purchase of manure and fertilizers, and in this way she hopes to continue her progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":692720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase manure and fertilizers to improve her crops ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T21:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raymunda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1045.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850544}],"funded_date":"2011-01-15T16:14:38Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Melbourne","image":762140}},{"id":269324,"name":"Marlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlita C. is from the town of Sta.

Irene still lives with her mother in a three-room house. The death of her fianc\u00e9 made  her confused in life since he was planning to let her further her education. Due to poverty her parents were unable to send her to school nor make her learn a trade. All this made her join GHAPE in 2008. She took her first loan which she invested in the rearing of fowls and buying and selling of used shoes. She also assists her mother in frying and selling puff-puff (fritters) and beans.\r\n\r\nGiven another loan, she plans to buy more used shoes to resell from one local market to another. Most of the people in her community are poor and cannot afford new shoes so most of them buy only used shoes. She also plans to rear fowls with part of the loan as fowls are a fast income-generating activity because they don\u2019t take a long time to mature.\r\n\r\nThe profit she gets from the loan shall be used to expand her business by growing fowls on a larger scale in order to satisfy more people. Part of the profit will also be used to educate her child and her nieces and nephews. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community in its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":768451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy used shoes and raise pigs and fowls.

She reserves the product with a down payment and the balance is given in payments, and in this manner she makes more profit, and in this same way they have begun to request clothing and other products. This is how she decided to open a store in her own home, and then began to travel to Trujillo because they would request good quality shoes. Little by little she gained more clients and her business prospered a lot. Unfortunately, when her daughter became ill she had to leave the business and dedicate herself to her family. After some time she has returned to the business but only in-home sales and it is going well because her clients are OK with that. With her income she has achieved economic stabilty as well as being able to help her husband with the construction of their own home.\r\n\r\nIn the future Yesenia would like to have a restaurant that serves traditional food; she has taken a course to be a chef and would like to serve as one. It is for this reason that she is saving money because she wishes to buy an adequate piece of land where she can build her restaurant. She and 8 partners are members of the group \u201cYHIRET\u201d. She has been with EDAPROSPO for close to 4 years and is happy with the support that she has received from this entity. Now she will use her loan in order to buy clothes and sneakers since she already has orders to fulfill.

She owns a business venture, selling local Samoan snacks such as palusami (coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves), cooked taro, yams, and soupo ese (hearty papaya soup). Tuamasaga has 3 years of experience in this business. Tuamasaga needs a loan of WST$1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tuamasaga joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tuamasaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is what Sarah M., a CCT* community partner, keeps in mind as she faces daily challenges in life owing to the fact that she reached only the third year in high school. Sarah, 61, is married to Wilfredo, a hotel driver. Together, they have raised four children, of whom one is studying while the other three are already working.  They live now in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nSarah manages a \"carinderia\" (food stall) at her home. Every day she wakes up to cook and serve delicious, healthy meals to people in their neighborhood. She also employs two helpers to assist her in the daily operation of the \"carinderia\". Monthly, she earns at least Php 7,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Sarah would like to apply for a Php 10,000 loan, which she will use to make sure the \"carinderia\" is in good shape to better serve the customers. She plans to buy ingredients of quality and in large quantity to gain a reputation for excellent service. Sarah dreams of expanding the \"carinderia\" and putting up her own store.\r\n\r\nTough, complaining customers challenge Sarah as well as customers who do not pay their debts on time.

is a hard working businessman. He is 43 years old and married with two kids. He sells bananas and fresh eggs. He buys his supplies from Volta in the south eastern part of Ghana and from poultry farms around Tema. He enjoys his trade very much but the prices of his commodities and transport have gone up due to the current fuel crisis. This has rendered his capital inadequate so he can't purchase appreciable quantities to sell. He therefore needs the loan to inject additional capital into his business so he meet the demands of the market.

Not having had the chance to continue in primary school because her parents lacked the means, she wasted no time going to work at her mother's side to earn an income.  Salimata has been advancing on her own now for ten years.  She chose as her niche the buying and selling of various goods, such as Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), jewelry, shoes, etc.  This is a very profitable business for her because she is in high demand by the women of Koutiala City. \r\n\r\nConcerned about augmenting her working capital and satisfying her customer demands for quality, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in 2007.  After two solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, she is now on her first individual loan.  She intends to buy 40 necklaces and 10 bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>.  Supplies are procured in Bamako and often in Senegal.  Sales are made in Koutiala City to customers composed of girls and married women, cash or credit accepted. \r\n\r\nSalimata hopes to realize a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that she envisions using to make loan interest payments, to care for her child, and to invest the rest in her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

M., who we see seated in the photograph, is 31 years-old and lives with her partner and her young, 5 year-old daughter. Veronica forms a part and is the treasurer of the group \"Mujeres Triunfadoras\" (Winning Women), along with 7 other members. The members of the group are all residents of the El Carmen area in the district of Carabayllo. \r\n\r\nVeronica specializes in sales, and takes advantages of seasonal products to earn money. During the whole year she sells beauty products, but now that we are near Christmas time she will invest the loan funds in the purchase of small cakes, which she will then sell to relatives, friends, and her husband's coworkers. \r\n\r\nVictoria has been working since a very young age. At the age of 5 she helped her mother sell sodas, and then, following her example, at the age of 12 had her own independent business and added a juice stand. With this job Victoria helped her parents with the purchase of her school supplies when she was a student. Today her sales pay for the cost of education for her daughter who studies in a private school. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Credo, Kiva

He buys piles of cut-down wood, splits it into smaller pieces, and makes bundles to be sold.

For this reason, he has planned the future purchase of a truck, but for this he would first need better economic stability, and so he is applying for this loan to buy wood, to split it and sell it.

Mukaddas is a teacher of secondary school in Shahristan town. At the same time, in order to earn additional income, she is growing different vegetables with the help of her father. They work hard at growing vegetables, which they sell in the market. \r\n\r\nLast season was very good and after much effort, they achieved a big harvest. Her father went the market to sell the crop they had labored for. Currently Mukaddas\u2019s family has a financial problem and she needs the help of all of us. \r\n\r\nThe family\u2019s desire is to continue planting vegetables and increase their capital to be able to invest more in seed and fertilizer. For this purpose, Mukaddas and her family are requesting a loan of $1800 USD, with which they would be able to improve their quality of life.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mamajon is 52 years old. He is married and has 3 children. Mamajon is the sole breadwinner for his family, and his only income comes from raising large livestock and selling them at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from farms in the adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. \r\n\r\nToday Mamajon is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd is not enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest a loan of 7000 Somoni into his business. In order to obtain this amount, Mamajon has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

According to her, her children help her maintain her crops of potatoes, peas and other vegetables in good order.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is being able to spend most of her time with her family.  \"Even though I don't live with my grown children, we always help each other out.  They are also farmers\", says Justina, very happily.\r\n\r\nHer main difficulty is the lack of working capital, which is why she started to work with the communal bank in her area.

Unfortunately, her husband works far from home. She has had an apiary for 4 years. This business was the idea of her in-laws, who motivated and guided her with everything related to beekeeping. She collects almost 130 liters of pure honey. Every three months, she travels to the city of Lima in order to sell the honey. She also fills orders for her friends and neighbors. She usually attends to her mother\u2019s shop, where she seizes the opportunity to sell honey. Her sales increase during festivities. On occasion, she even sells the honey as a street vendor in the local markets. Edith likes this job because it allows her enough time to look after her children. Her business gets into financial trouble during flower shortages in the area. Flowers are indispensable nourishment for the bees, which means she has to invest more in them during this type of situation.<p>\r\nShe believes that her reason for working is to increase profits and her children\u2019s well-being, since her husband\u2019s salary is often not sufficient.<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan in order to obtain beehives, containers, and food for her bees. In the future, she would like to sell wholesale honey in a large store. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEdith tiene 33 a\u00f1os y vive con sus dos hijos, su esposo, lamentablemente y por necesidad trabaja lejos de casa.\r\nDesde hace 4 a\u00f1os, tiene una colmenar, se inicio por idea de sus suegros que la animaron y orientaron en todo lo referente a la crianza de abejas, re\u00fane cerca de 130  litros de miel pura, cada tres meses viaja a la ciudad de Lima para venderla y tambi\u00e9n cubre pedidos vecinos y amistades, generalmente atiende la bodega de su madre, donde aprovecha para vender la miel, sus ventas se incrementan durante las festividades, en ocasiones, la ofrece de manera ambulante en los mercados.Edith gusta de este trabajo porque le permite tener tiempo y atender a sus hijos, su negocio se complica cuando hay escasez de flores en su zona, estas son el alimento indispensable para sus abejas, por lo que entonces, tiene que invertir m\u00e1s en ellas. <p>\r\nElla considera que el motivo de su trabajo es para acrecentar sus ganancias en bienestar de sus hijos, ya que mucha veces el sueldo de su esposo no alcanza. <p>\r\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo para adquirir colmenas, envases y alimento para sus abejas, en un futuro le gustar\u00eda vender miel al por mayor, en una gran tienda."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":188716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase beehives and food for bees in order to continue honey production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-08-08T09:10:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith Fanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-22T14:39:25Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121,"local_amount":333.79,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-23T07:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":343.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334622},{"amount":121,"local_amount":333.79,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":343.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369012},{"amount":120.5,"local_amount":332.41,"processed_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":341.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335646},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":342.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956824},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":342.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227079},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":342.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422322}],"funded_date":"2008-08-08T14:39:25Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":63652,"name":"Nueva Semilla Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Nueva Semilla (New Seed) group bank consists of 14 women and one man who live in Villa Adela, Sensata, Cruz del Sur, Huayna Potosi, and other neighborhoods close to the Viacha Highway in the city of El Alto.

She lives with her two children and her sister in her mother's house. Years back she worked as a maid in the city of Lima. She had to return to Tarma because her daughter was sick. For the moment she decided to help her uncle out for 4 months in a restaurant. She starts work at 6 am and gets off at 4 pm. They pay her daily 15 Soles (about $5) and also give her lunch. \r\n<p>\r\nSoledad's goal is to plant on her family's land because she knows that agriculture is profitable. Her sister will help her to work the land.  Her only problem is that she does not have enough money to buy fertilizer. She is convinced that planting citrus fruits and coffee is the best choice. She will have to wait for her coffee to grow but in the mean time she will do other jobs.  She know that it will take time for the coffee to grow.\r\n<p>\r\nDespite all of the difficulties that Soledad has faced, she has worked hard to make payments on her previous two loans on time.  She has never been late on a payment and she attends all of the meetings and workshops to learn more about operating a business.  This will be her third loan with MFP.  The money that she is requesting will be used to buy coffee plants and fertilizer to promote a productive crop.\r\n<p>\r\n(Translated by Alexis of San Roque High School)<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kendra Gaete, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":269395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase Coffee Plants and Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1054.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210930}],"funded_date":"2009-02-12T22:05:39Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kendra Gaete","image":null}},{"id":92342,"name":"Ayaovi Amenyona","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce monsieur exerce depuis 2005 le commerce de v\u00eatement, le commerce de v\u00eatement marche bien \u00e0 lom\u00e9, parce que les jeunes aiment beaucoup s\u2019habiller \u00e0 lom\u00e9, il a une client\u00e8le \u00e9lev\u00e9e c\u2019est pour cela qu\u2019il s\u2019adresse \u00e0 wages pour obtenir un cr\u00e9dit en vue de satisfaire la demande.

SLRA Makeni has a total of twenty-one staff. Over the years, SLRA Makeni has been able to construct many roads in the township of Makeni, making the town accessible to vehicles.  \r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan members of SLRA Makeni are requesting from SMT. Previously, only nine staff members applied for a loan from SMT. With the success of the previous loans to staff, six new members of staff were encouraged to join their colleagues in applying for a loan this time around. With a loan, staff members will be able to invest it in something needed and out of their monthly salaries, they will repay the loan. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture like a bed or chairs, other will use theirs to invest in business, some will invest theirs in a house-building project and others will use the loan to pay for their children's schooling.\r\n\r\nAnthony S. K. (first from left) is a member of the three-man loan recovery committee and also head of security for SLRA Makeni. Anthony was born in Port Loko, northern Sierra Leone.

Como primer paso, busca a sus clientes por las ma\u00f1anas, mientras que su esposa va almacenando lo que se ha fabricado para tenerlo listo en el momento que se necesite llevarlo al cliente. Asimismo, ofrece sus canaletas a las principales tiendas ferreteras  de su barrio pactando cobrarles de manera semanal. Esta actividad le ha permitido a Jorge hacer progresar econ\u00f3micamente a su familia, por lo que ha decidido comprar m\u00e1s materia prima para seguir produciendo en mayor cantidad sus canaletas. Esta es la tercera vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y est\u00e1 muy satisfecho de formar parte de un grupo humano donde se siente bien integrado e identificado como es su banco comunal. El dinero solicitado ser\u00e1 destinado a la compra de fierros y calaminas que son los principales materiales que utiliza para la fabricaci\u00f3n de las canaletes. ","en":"Jorge is 33 years old, and lives with his wife and 2 children in a house he owns.  For the past six years, he has dedicated himself to fabricating gutters\/water channels.  These are placed on the roof of a home during the rainy season.  He learned the trade from a friend, during a time when he worked as a laborer.  Today, together with his wife (who appears in the photograph), he manufactures them and transports them to neighboring towns to sell.  He first tries looking for customers in the mornings, while his wife organizes their goods and readies the product to be delivered to a customer at a moments\u2019 notice.  Likewise, he offers his product in his neighborhood\u2019s hardware stores agreeing to charge on a weekly basis.  This activity has allowed Jorge to support his family financially, a reason why he\u2019s decided to buy more raw materials to produce his gutters in greater quantity.  This is the third time he has taken a loan with MFP, and he is very gratified to be part of a group where he feels well-integrated as he does with his cooperative bank.  The funds he is requesting will be used to buy metals and mill scale, the principal materials he needs to fabricate his product. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":349924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T15:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1522.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717174}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T18:32:43Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":125110,"name":"Yeny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yeny es madre de un ni\u00f1o de 5 a\u00f1os que ya empez\u00f3 a estudiar, vive con su esposo, quien es contador y trabaja en una instituci\u00f3n privada.

Her business is raising and selling small animals, specifically penned birds.  She mainly raises turkeys in pens located in the rear part of her house, and sells them to the businesspersons who come regularly to this place.  This business helps her to take care of the daily household expenses, since her husband's income as an agricultural worker are not sufficient to cover them.  Mar\u00eda Cruz hopes to improve the quality of the birds that she sells, in order to earn greater profits.  For this reason, she sees the need of requesting a loan of $300 for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa that she plans to use to purchase a balanced feed in order to achieve her objective.  She is quite a responsible woman who always gives 100% of herself to get her family ahead.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  RTW (ready-to-wear) and frozen foods businesses. \r\n\r\nHayde joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she wished for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hayde has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000 - uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use to buy additional frozen foods and stocks for her RTW businesses so that she can continue to save up for expanding them. Hayde C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She has been making pi\u00f1atas for four years, as this was something her family has been doing for a long time and she enjoyed the work.  At the beginning it was difficult to bring in customers since she was just starting, so she decided to equip herself with a catalog of the different figures, which she could show to customers.  This way, people could get to know her work.  Through perseverance, she has succeeded in having her pi\u00f1atas sold in commercial centers and candy shops.  Her sales increase during the December holidays and drop a bit at the beginning of the year, but for her this is no reason to lose motivation and she keeps working.  Her plans are to expand her business and to have more people know her work.  She will use the requested loan to buy materials like different colors of tissue paper, glue, cardboard, etc., and to bring in a little more income to invest in her children's education.\r\n\r\nMahanaim is grateful for the the support offered by Kiva through Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, as it will help them to reach their goals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie

buying and selling firewood. She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. Alma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.\r\n\r\n Her previous loan of PHP 8000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to purchase more firewood to sell so that she can continue to save up for future for her child and family needs. Alma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

They live in traditional families.  They are 38 years old on average and have at least 4 children.  They cultivate peanuts and beans.  With the intention of making their agricultural concerns profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso credit program four years ago. After having fully repaid their previous loans, they are on their fourth country loan.  Hawa, standing in the center, expects to use their loan to buy a sufficient quantity of peanut seeds, some light equipment, labor costs and agricultural fertilizers for cultivation exclusively at the big market in Kimparana city.  After the rainy season, the harvests are stored for a certain amount of time so that they gain value before being sold at the big market in Moribila San and in the surrounding markets at retail (or often wholesale) for cash to a customer base generally coming from the big cities.  The members of the group expect to each make a profit of 32,000 to 35,000 FCFA after the harvest of their agricultural products, which will be used to pay the interest on their loans and their families' current expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":789493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fertilizers, seeds, light equipment and labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Nikankan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Konimba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siatan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1350,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-17T08:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":609464.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424521}],"funded_date":"2011-07-06T06:48:55Z","paid_date":"2012-04-17T08:31:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Martha Schmitz","image":489893}},{"id":310353,"name":"Tatiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Tatiana es socia del  Banco Comunal \u201cVirgen de Concepci\u00f3n\u201d, ubicado en el C.P.

This way, Heidi doesn't have to leave her in someone else's care. Next year, her daughter will be in kindergarten; this will make it easier for both of them. Heidi's oldest son helps out a lot when he doesn't have school. He goes with her, brings merchandise to the customers, and takes payments under his mother's supervision.\r\nAlong with her husband and children, Heidi has been growing as a businesswoman. She is very hard-working. In the future she hopes to have her own home, and she hopes that her business will continue to grow for the benefit of her entire family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":948407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

Some sell clothes, others medicines and food items, some selling from home and others door-to-door.  The group has a record of paying their loans on time, both within the committee and to Fundacion.  They have savings of 2,982,681.  They hold joint activities such as raffles and dinners to build their savings in case one of their members becomes sick or so that they can accelerate their loan payments to Fundacion.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this cycle, the efforts the women have made to improve their lives have been notable.  The support of the group has been fundamental to the growth of their businesses and also to their self-worth which has developed as they've come to see themselves as active players within the group.

When she was single, she used to plant crops in her parents\u2019 fields, mostly citrus fruits, but since she fell in love with a farmer who is an expert in cultivating coffee and cacao, she has increased her plantings with these crops.  Six years ago she transplanted coffee plants into her orchard, between the trees, and in the first harvest she was quite successful. This allowed her to buy a car in order to get deeper into the fields where there are no roads to gather the harvest of citrus fruits, coffee and cacao.  This vehicle has also allowed her to earn money transporting her neighbors\u2019 crops, charging between 80 and 100 Soles (Peruvian currency) per load depending on the distance and the cost of the product.  When her husband travels with his produce to different markets, she returns in her vehicle to continue gathering crops for the next trip.

With this new credit she will be able to buy more sheep in order to expand her activity and increase her earnings, with the goal of better meeting her family\u2019s needs, such as for example the school fees and healthcare costs of her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":554672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Bolstering the investment capital of the solidarity group","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Diourbel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokhaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mame Saye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thiabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndock","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mame Saye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dib Aliou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nogaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1225000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1225000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2300,"local_amount":1225000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-31T09:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1235485.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182517996}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T12:06:08Z","paid_date":"2010-12-31T09:58:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":212020,"name":"Josephena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephena F. is a 50-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: rice and feeds retailing, and general store.

She is 57 years old. Susan is single and has one adult-aged children. To make a living, Susan owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling health & medicinal products like lagundi syrup, gotukola & assorted food supplements in the local community. Susan has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 9000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Susan joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Susan is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Susan from HSPFI.
