For the moment she rents the place where she works by paying an affordable price which allows her to have a higher margin of profit.  She complements her plates with refreshing natural drinks, sodas, and beer.  She has spent more than two years at this location, tending to her customers with the help of her sister.\r\n\r\nShe believes her business is profitable because it has brought her much personal and financial satisfaction.  She remembers that she began her business with the sale of juices, later moving on to the sale of food with a traveling table until she could find the money needed to rent a comfortable place.  Seeing the progress of her business, she has the desire to buy the place that she currently rents because it is in a commercial zone and she hopes to keep growing there.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the MFP institution.  Therefore, she is grateful for the financing and the confidence that they have placed in her by accepting her request so that she can accomplish her goals.  On the other hand, she says that she feels good with her communal bank because she has their permanent support.  She will invest the requested amount of 1500 nuevos soles in the purchase of tables and chairs to improve the comfort of her customers.  She will also buy the supplies and ingredients that she needs to prepare her meals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1280770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs as well as ingredients that she needs to prepare her food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-21T16:31:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-20T16:31:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":223.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":238.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":247},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":256.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":260.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":274.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.8},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.48,"local_amount":223.69,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":228.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122976},{"amount":95.24,"local_amount":238.12,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":243.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868797},{"amount":98.8,"local_amount":247,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":252.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577638},{"amount":102.49,"local_amount":256.22,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":261.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529869},{"amount":104.27,"local_amount":260.68,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":266.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974899},{"amount":109.72,"local_amount":274.29,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":280.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996156}],"funded_date":"2013-01-21T17:49:06Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":519679,"name":"Maradi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maradi is 30 years old.

It is made up of ten members and is led by a board of directors whose treasurer is Sonia.  The businesses run by the communal bank's members are varied and include: cosmetics sales, a local shop, various products, plants and plant pots, duvet sales, book sales and pork crackling sales.  The loan will benefit small microentrepreneurs, one of whom is Sonia. She says that she joined pro Mujer six months ago at the invitation of her aunt who is a member of the organisation.  She currently runs a business selling potatoes and says that she learned the trade on her own initiative as it generated a good income.  The loan which she is now seeking is for capital increase (the purchase of potatoes) which she will buy in bulk from the markets in Ciudad de El Alto and later sell on her stall.  This type of work enables her to generate resources to maintain her home as far as possible, as she is married with two children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she replies that she likes the training on health-related issues.

She sells her goods at a local market, and is applying for a loan for 1,700,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more rolls of cloth, thread and an electric sewing machine. Her major business challenges include transportation and the seasonal nature of the demand for her products. Her goal for the future is to own a tailoring school and employ two girls to help her with her tailoring work.

It is the second largest population county in Liberia and rich in natural resources. \r\n\r\nRufus is married, with three children ages 6, 8, and 23, all of whom live at home and attend school. For the past 10 years he has been running a general shop. He has requested this loan to purchase more biscuit, batteries, butter, soap, oil, rice, toothpaste, milk etc., in other to have his business turn into a bigger one. \r\n\r\nThe problem he's faced with is small capital. He started this business by selling for his father on a table at the market and learned this from friends.

She is married and has five children, aged 20, 17, 14, 11 and 8 years. \r\n\r\nIn 1997, Jestina established her patient medicine business to assist her husband in the running of the home. She went through training at the Nixiou Hospital in Segbwema. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 2,240,000 SLL (Sierra Leone leones) every month. \r\n\r\nJestina would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. She has already received and successfully repaid loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy more pharmaceuticals.

She also feels proud because her only daughter is following in her footsteps in this activity in addition to training to become a professional.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to continue making progress adding more food items to her stand.

His customers\u2019 demands have motivated him to always do good work and to continue improving in what he does.  He\u2019s open from 8 in the morning until 8 at night.\r\n\r\nHe likes what he does very much because it allows him to work in what he\u2019s been passionate about since he was a boy.  The opportunities this job provides him and the satisfaction he gets from it every day have led him to feel more confident and happy every time to have put his efforts into this activity.  He hopes soon to open a welding shop and to work even harder giving the best of himself always to continue doing quality work.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #2 and he\u2019s grateful for the opportunity and the trust placed in him in order to be eligible for this loan.  On the other hand, he commits to make his payments punctually.  He is happy to be part of the communal bank he belongs to because he\u2019s seen that the members are responsible, supportive people.  He will use the requested 1,000 soles to buy two cans of solder.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1280901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy two cans of solder.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-21T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-20T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":149},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":158.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":164.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":170.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":173.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":183.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.6,"local_amount":149,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":152.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122982},{"amount":63.45,"local_amount":158.63,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":161.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868803},{"amount":65.82,"local_amount":164.54,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":168.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577644},{"amount":68.27,"local_amount":170.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":174.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529875},{"amount":69.46,"local_amount":173.65,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":177.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974905},{"amount":73.4,"local_amount":183.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":187.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996162}],"funded_date":"2013-01-21T21:03:11Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":519835,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a woman of 43 years and a mother of two children.

(Women in progress) 1, 2 & 3. This group is located in a rural community surrounded by sugarcane fields in the outskirts of San Pedro de Macoris. She makes her home in a simple structure with her long-term partner and three children. For the past six years she has operated a grocery stall where she serves her customers and sells different products. She started her business with her own capital after saving for a while.\r\n\r\nPaulina is excited to be a part of this third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan portions and grown her business.

She is very happy to know that she has financial support as she feels more secure going ahead in her business, and she promises once more to complete the payments punctually as she does not want to leave a bad impression about herself in front of the members of her group.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 2000 soles, she will buy more fish, because recently she has been having a greater demand and she wants to expand her variety of fish.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1278586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fish as recently she has been having a greater demand and she wants to buy more variety of fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-21T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-20T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":298.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":317.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":329.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":341.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":347.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":364.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":119.36,"local_amount":298.41,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":304.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122987},{"amount":127.07,"local_amount":317.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":324.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868808},{"amount":131.81,"local_amount":329.52,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":336.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577649},{"amount":136.72,"local_amount":341.81,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":349.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529880},{"amount":139.12,"local_amount":347.78,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":355.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974910},{"amount":145.92,"local_amount":364.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":372.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996171}],"funded_date":"2013-01-21T23:46:52Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":519953,"name":"Ana Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Empanadas, salchichas, con papas, arepas con huevos, empanadas, picadas y patacones, son los principales productos,  que Ana vende desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, en su peque\u00f1o negocio, ubicado en su domicilio al suroccidente de la ciudad, donde habita con su esposo y tiene 3 hijos adultos.

She was widowed some time ago, but this has not prevented her from continuing to provide her only daughter, Cindy, with everything she needs in life.  They live in their own home, and they also share their days with Cindy's grandmother.  Juliana's mother and daughter have become her main and only motive to give the best of herself in everything she does so that she can get ahead.  Juliana has a business selling fish.\r\n\r\nOver a long period of time, she figured out how to succeed in the competitive business world.  She did a lot of types of work before she came to her current occupation.  She started out with the help of one of her friends, who offered her space in her stall in the main market of the city, and this is where she began her journey.  Now, she has her own stall.  At the beginning, she used to feel that due to her lack of experience, she would not be able to sell what she needed to support herself.  However, time has provided her with enough experience that she now earns substantial profits by the end of each day.  She's been selling for 12 years, and she sells fish of all sizes and prices.  She starts her work at 4 in the morning, and finishes by noon.  She complements this business by working in the afternoons selling soft drinks and ice from her house, and she also occasionally does sewing work, making pants, shirts and blouses.  Her work has allowed her to have time to be with her daughter at the most important moments of her life, and this gives her great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nJuliana has learned a lot from all of her life experiences.  At her work she is very well-liked by her fellow merchants, because she always has a smile on her face and a word of encouragement for her friends.  She feels very happy to be generating her own income.  She has a lot of plans in mind, but at the moment what she wants the most is to keep working.  For the future, she wants to set up a grocery store business in her home.  She wants to achieve this in the near future.  \r\n\r\nThis is Juliana's 8th loan with MFP.

She will also use the money in buying grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her variety store. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain the daily needs and educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nNieves dreams that her businesses will continue to grow and hopes that her children will finish their studies. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of their work. It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

For additional income, she also sells different tidbits, dainties and sweetmeats.

Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nLourdes dreams of expanding her business and of having more customers.

is Marceline. She previously accessed a 50,000 Philippine peso (PHP) loan that she used to buy spare parts and accessories for her jeepney as well as pay for its maintenance. Her earnings were a big help in their personal, household and business expenditures. She has been in this business for twenty years now and they have six jeepney units. She also rents out a house for additional income.\r\n\r\nMarceline would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and pay for maintenance of their jeepney. Her profits from the business will definitely help meet her business and family\u2019s daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMarceline hopes that her business will grow even more and prays for good health. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney \u2013 open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

She is married to Gregorio, a mechanic, and she is a mother to their children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their business. She is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHelen operates a variety store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them individually. Her regular customers are her neighbors and others in the community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan to help her continue to operate her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nHelen dreams of seeing all of her children successful in their careers, and she also hopes to expand her business. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories about her life and her business and to draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1281122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

When asked  'How will this loan benefit your family?', Ineah replied 'assist in paying school fees.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Ineah owns the following: 'a cow and poultry' but does not own 'a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'a mosquito net and electricity' but does not have 'solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo

She has seven children and has been doing this work for eight years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'dairy farming!' Her biggest challenge is 'price fluctuations'. One of the animals on the farm is named 'lelmet.'\r\n\r\nJocelyn was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'fair interest rate.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'saving for the future.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Jocelyn replied 'better quality of life\". She will use the loan of 40,000 KES from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jocelyn owns the following: 'a cow and poultry' but does not own 'a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net and TV' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine or a DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1281193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T07:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T07:50:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jocelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2876.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2952.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3110.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3192.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3276.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3363.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3452.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3543.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3637.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3733.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3831.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.94,"local_amount":2942.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T08:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3038.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347304970},{"amount":35.87,"local_amount":3020.45,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3118.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355846176},{"amount":36.82,"local_amount":3100.29,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3201.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768557},{"amount":37.79,"local_amount":3182.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3285.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516625},{"amount":38.79,"local_amount":3266.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3372.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960227},{"amount":39.81,"local_amount":3352.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3461.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390819933},{"amount":40.87,"local_amount":3441.32,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3553.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417029},{"amount":85,"local_amount":7157.95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7390.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980569},{"amount":125.11,"local_amount":10536.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10878.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529205}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T08:55:07Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T17:30:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":520042,"name":"Veronico","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For the past 12 years, Veronico has been selling baked snack food in his local community for a living.

With the received credit, Zviad will purchase a stock of groceries. This will increase the sales and thus the income of the family.

","en":"Mavluda is a very hard-working and driven woman. She is married and has 2 adult children. \r\n\r\nMavluda had a difficult life as a child. From early childhood, she worked as a seamstress: every day after school, she made dresses for other girls and women of her village, in order to earn some money for her family. When she was older, Mavluda moved to the city to go to college, got married, and once again started sewing women's clothing. In order to provide food for their children, her husband became a butcher. \r\n\r\nIn addition to sewing, Mavluda cultivates wheat, corn, peas and other crops. She has been in this business for over 20 years. Her husband, son and daughter-in-law help her with farming. Mavluda sells her harvest directly to the local populace at prices that are lower than those at a market. Most people in the region purchase wheat, process it into flour at a mill, then bake their own bread.\r\n\r\nMavluda would like to increase her income in order to pay for her youngest daughter's education. Mavluda herself dreamed of post-secondary studies, but was unable to pursue them due to family circumstances. This is why she now works hard and tries to provide university education for her children. \r\n\r\nMavluda is planning to launch a new livestock business in order to earn additional income. She has taken the course \"Succeed\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and received her graduation certificate. She is requesting a loan of 15000 somoni to purchase cattle and is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":1280388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy cattle for her new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T09:00:02Z","loan_amount":3150,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavluda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":3150,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15000.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549917}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T19:41:53Z","paid_date":"2013-09-21T08:53:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":520060,"name":"Andrea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Andrea, 60, is a married woman with one child.

For the past two years, Damalie has been working hard to manage her general store, a retail shop. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Damalie has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to develop the business and buy more goods such as cooking oil, sodas, and flour, and will help Damalie to generate greater profits and be in position to pay school fees for her children. Damalie hopes that in the future she will be able to have a bigger business. \r\n\r\nDamalie is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She has four young children ages 12, 11, 7 and 5 years old. \r\n\r\nShe runs a sari-sari or variety store business, selling various goods and commodities to the people in her place. \r\n\r\nAnabel wants to improve her business but lacks the capital to do so.

This is 38-year-old Ibrahim from Kulanda Town Branch Southern Area Bo District. He is married and has three children between the ages of 2 years and 16 years. Two of his children attend school. \r\n\r\nIbrahim runs a shoe store where he sells ladies' sandal, shoes, children's slippers, etc. He has been running this business for five years. He works at the business from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., seven days per week.  His business is the only source of income he has.

Benina is 18 years old and lives in the town of Nansana in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past year, Benina has been working hard to manage her outside catering business, which sells chips and other foods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Benina has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to obtain more raw food such as Irish potatoes and cooking oil to use in the business. This will help Benina to generate greater profits and pay her bills. Benina hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nBenina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Her loan request was approved in the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program facilitates business start-ups and re-startups with credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Tea will purchase calves. She will raise them and sell them after several months. Grown calves will be sold for a good price, bringing additional income to the family. For the next cycle, Tea will purchase more calves. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.

She began her business because she needs to take proper care of her children. She works at the business 13 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are reduced purchasing power of her customers and transportation costs.\r\nFanta needs a loan in order to buy more cosmetics, including creams, Vaseline and baby powder. She hopes that the extra income resulting from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her family\u2019s standard of living. In the future, Fanta plans to see her business grow.

provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nLa Parroquia de Aluriqu\u00edn guarda paisajes inimaginables, en donde tambi\u00e9n se puede practicar deportes de aventura y est\u00e1 solo apenas a 20  minutos de la ciudad. Lugar poblado por contadas familias que se han dedicado a las actividades agr\u00edcolas y pecuarias como es el caso de Sandra, una mujer joven de 22 a\u00f1os que a pesar de los obst\u00e1culos econ\u00f3micos y personales, pudo terminar con \u00e9xito la secundaria y ahora vive con su pareja Darwin de 24 a\u00f1os con quien tiene un hijo a quien espera apoyarle siempre hasta verlo convertido en profesional. \nSandra se dedica a la crianza de pollos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n. Debido a la falta de capital y oportunidades de cr\u00e9ditos, no ha podido incrementar su negocio en el cual tiene mucha experiencia. Para lograr este objetivo ha solicitado un cr\u00e9dito a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes le brindaron agilidad y confianza. Aprovechando esta oportunidad, Sandra ha incluido a sus amigos emprendedores como ella para obtener un pr\u00e9stamo grupal el cual ser\u00e1 invertido en cada uno de sus negocios. En el caso de Sandra comprar\u00e1 algunos pollos e insumos para su crianza al igual que Juan quien adem\u00e1s cr\u00eda y comercializa cerdos con la ayuda de su esposa para as\u00ed poder sustentar a sus 3 hijos y darles una educaci\u00f3n y estilo de vida dignos. Y finalmente Deysi de 35 a\u00f1os que trabaja para  sacar adelante a su hija y lo hace vendiendo ropa, cosm\u00e9ticos y bisuter\u00eda la cual espera incrementar y comprar al por mayor con el pr\u00e9stamo para obtener descuentos y tener mayor utilidad. \nLos integrantes de este grupo tienen en com\u00fan que se movilizan a la ciudad y parroquias aleda\u00f1as para vender sus productos, lo cual se convierte en trabajo duro y esforzado cada d\u00eda pero sin embargo no ha sido causa para que alguno se d\u00e9 por vencido, pues sus motivaciones personales y familiares les fortalecen para seguir adelante y luchar por sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"The San Jos\u00e9 de Alluriqu\u00edn parish is located in central northwest Ecuador in a rural area that is full of fertile land and leafy trees.  It is in Santo Domingo, the capital of the San Jos\u00e9 de Alluriqu\u00edn province in Santo Domingo.  It is an Ecuadorean province that has experienced a high, sustained level of growth in recent years. The capital is a city which offers attractive, colorful, delicious fruits and cuisine. It also has a considerable amount of commerce as it has become a dry port where commercial exchange takes place between the country's mountainous and coastal regions.  It also has various tourist attractions, which are very popular with national and international tourists, and a warm climate.  That is why most of the city\u2019s inhabitants have undertaken a commercial business activity or provide services for its residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nThe Aluriqu\u00edn parish has unbelievable scenery where you can practice adventure sports, and it is just 20 minutes from the city.  Families in the area have devoted themselves to agricultural and livestock business activities.  This is the case with Sandra.  She is a 22 year old woman, who in spite of financial and personal obstacles, was able to successfully complete high school.  She now lives with her life partner, 24 year old Darwin.  They have a son, whom they hope to always support until he becomes a professional.  Sandra raises chickens to later sell.  Due to the lack of capital and loan opportunities, she has not been able to increase her business in which she has a lot of experience.  In order to achieve this objective she has requested a loan, which was offered speedily and with confidence, from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of this opportunity, Sandra has joined together with enterprising friends who are like her in order to get a group loan.  The loan will be invested in each one of their businesses.  Sandra will buy some chickens and supplies for raising them.  \r\n\r\nJuan will do the same.  He also, with his wife\u2019s help, raises and sells pigs.  They do this in order to be able to support their three children, to give them an education, and to give them a decent life style.  \r\n\r\nLastly, Deysi is 35 years old.  She works in order to get her daughter ahead.  She does this by selling clothes, cosmetics, and jewelry.  She hopes to increase sales and use the loan to buy wholesale in order to get discounts and to have greater profits.\r\n\r\nThe thing the members of the group have in common is that they move around the city and nearby parishes to sell their products.  This becomes hard work that requires a great deal of effort every day.  Nevertheless, it has not been the reason for any of them to give up.  Their personal and familial motivations strengthen them so that they continue on and fight for their dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1275903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens, feed, and supplies for the chicken coops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T15:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T15:50:01Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deysi Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Agustin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1414.66,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":221.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":228.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":235.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":238.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":243.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":248}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":222.72,"local_amount":221.1,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":222.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516841},{"amount":229.95,"local_amount":228.29,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":229.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068696},{"amount":237.13,"local_amount":235.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":237.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494962},{"amount":240.39,"local_amount":238.65,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":240.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524890},{"amount":245,"local_amount":243.22,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":245,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133194},{"amount":249.81,"local_amount":248,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":249.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313735}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T18:11:37Z","paid_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":517689,"name":"Jonathan Andres","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jonathan es un joven trabajador de 22 a\u00f1os, es soltero y tiene un hijo de apenas un a\u00f1o y 4 meses.

Jonathan aprendi\u00f3 desde muy chico a trabajar con los cultivos, pues su diario vivir en el campo lo llevaron a aprender. Jonathan tambi\u00e9n juega f\u00fatbol en su tiempo libre que es muy poco ya que dedica al cuidado y cosecha de los cultivos al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda.

","en":"Jonathan is a hard-working young man of 22 years of age. He is single and has a son who is only a year and four months old. Jonathan grew up in a family of scant economic resources who were in unity even in difficult circumstances. They made a living from agriculture. Thanks to his parents, Jonathan finished secondary school. He now lives with his father Ricardo in Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pichincha, one of the largest provinces in the Republic of Ecuador. This canton is found a few kilometers away from the city of Quito and has many forests. Its neighborhoods are populated with kind people and customs native to this city, in which there are different microbusinesses run by enterprising people who fight each day to make their dreams a reality. Other activities include agriculture and farming - producing abundant crops which are later sold and distributed to many other provinces. It also has various tourist attractions such as waterfalls, rivers, trails, and spas, which tourists are attracted to for safety-guaranteed adventure sports. \n\nWith the help of his father, Jonathan grows naranjillas, a fruit common to Latin American countries. It has prickly skin but a juicy and acidic pulp, with which you can make nectars, desserts, and marmalades. You can plant them in any season but they require a lot of care to prevent pests and agricultural diseases from affecting them. Jonathan learnt to work with the crops from a very young age, but he is still learning the daily life of the land. Jonathan also plays soccer in his free time, of which he has little since he spends eight hours a day caring for and harvesting the crops. He also spends time looking after the livestock, which will later be sold. Jonathan dreams of continuing his studies and becoming a professional in the agricultural industry so that he can be an example and an inspiration to his son. Although he thinks that it is a job that requires a lot of dedication and effort, he does not think any activity is difficult because he has learnt from experience that every process has its routine. Jonathan needs to buy naranjilla seeds to increase the number of sown fields of naranjilla he has. He also needs to buy products to give better treatment to his animals so he can sell them at a higher price. Therefore, he is requesting a loan so he can carry out these objectives and obtain greater revenue for fulfilling his dreams.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1276776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

With his mini-bus, he will transport the passengers between Kobuleti and a neighboring district. His loan request was approved in the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program will provide business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to the country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and who are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, the income of the family will increase and they will be able to improve their living conditions. Along with the above-mentioned, the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1281359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

She\u2019s lived with Riter, 43, for 28 years and they are the parents of two children who are 17 and 21 years old.  She was able to buy her own house four years ago thanks to the money she and her spouse were able to save.  She spends her days there in the company of her entire family always giving her best to continue moving forward and reach her goals.\r\n\r\nLeodila\u2019s business consists in selling lumber and to do so she constantly travels to areas along the river where the lumber she needs is sold.  Everything she acquires is transported to the city in one of the boats used for river transport; they she looks for customers.  She\u2019s been doing this for nearly a year and works with help from her son-in-law.  She also has three additional boats she uses to transport passengers or merchandise to population centers along river banks.  Her main function is to enter into contract with merchants that transport goods to these places that are along her route.  With respect to people, all she has to do is call them together by means of an informative ad placed in the place she\u2019s headed to and once her boat has the recommended number of passengers she heads out providing all the required safety precautions.\r\n\r\nDuring the time she\u2019s been doing this, she\u2019s learned to know the material needs of inhabitants in the zones she visits and this has helped her determine the amount and frequency of visits she must make carrying the necessary goods.  Her profits are very good and this gives her much peace of mind and security to continue facing the adversities that might arise along the way.\r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #3 and she\u2019s very happy to know that she has financial support because she\u2019ll feel surer about advancing in her work.  She also commits once again to make her payments punctually like she\u2019s done previously.

She is married, has four children, and lives with the youngest in their own house, striving to get ahead to lead a better lifestyle.  Doris sells fish for a living, out of a stall she has in front of her house.  Fortunately, sales are high and she earns a good profit, thanks to the fact that her strategic location is on a visible corner.  But her work requires much sacrifice to get the quality, fresh products she sells to her customers.  She gets up early in the morning to go to the fishing port to get the most popular items, such as boquichico, sea urchin, sardines or catfish.  She knows the effort is worth it, since her daughter has everything she needs to live comfortably.  \r\n\r\nDoris has been in business for 11 years now, and works alone.  Her motivation for wanting to get ahead is her desire to do a good job and earn an income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys the freedom her work gives her, since she can spend the afternoons practicing some sport, while spending time with her family.  She hopes to continue expanding her business and begin selling bananas.  This is her second loan through the MFP institution.  She is grateful to all the people who make this loan possible, allowing her to continue toward her goal.  She is committed to paying off the loan on time.\r\n\r\nThe amount requested will be used to buy fish and bananas so she can continue working."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1280345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a variety of fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":119.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":126.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":131.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":136.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":138.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":146.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.45,"local_amount":119.25,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":123.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122969},{"amount":51.57,"local_amount":126.96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":131.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868790},{"amount":53.5,"local_amount":131.69,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":136.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577631},{"amount":55.5,"local_amount":136.6,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":141.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529862},{"amount":56.46,"local_amount":138.98,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":144.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974892},{"amount":59.52,"local_amount":146.52,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":151.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996149}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T16:55:56Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":520161,"name":"Gayane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gayane is 57 years old.

is 29 years old. He lives in the suburbs of Tbilisi with his family: wife, parents-in-law and sister-in-law.  Ivane\u2019s wife is a waitress and his father-in-law serves the locals as a taxi driver. Ivane\u2019s economic activity is his newly-started business. In particular he is a shoe-maker and sews shoes. Ivane requested credit to expand his business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.

She also takes care of her cousin. She operates a retail shop at the market and has been in this business for two years selling to all categories of people on retail.

He operates a produce business dealing in the buying and selling of peanuts, coffee and beans, which he started four years back as a source of income.  He had dropped out school due to lack of tuition  fees.\r\n\r\nJosephat wants a loan of UGX 1,000,000(one million shillings) to buy more coffee, maize and peanuts to boost his cereals business so that he can have  good returns.

She has been running a charcoal business for three years now.

She is enterprising, and has the desire to improve herself and get ahead in life. She has faced an obstacle with her education, as her parents are low income and couldn't give her the opportunity to go to school. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband decided to look for opportunities to succeed, considering that they had tremendous potential in terms of youth, good health, and her strong desire for an additional livelihood apart from being just a housewife. Her husband has worked the land all his life, where his work enables him to support the household. \r\n\r\nBoth saw the need for one of the two to find a way of generating a bit more income, and an opportunity arose for Javy to take a beauty salon course offered by FUDEIMFA, the technical arm of the COMIXMUL cooperative. Thanks to this opportunity, she learned to fend for herself in a different way. She trained in cutting men's and women's hair. Currently she goes from house to house, serving people of all ages, with only two pairs of scissors, a cape and two combs.\r\n\r\nJavy is now requesting help to buy tools and supplies for work, such as a hair dryer and hair iron, a chair, mirrors, a table, capes, combs and brushes.

For the past 3 years, Juliet has been working hard to manage her poultry farm, which sells chicks. \n\nTo help expand her business, Juliet has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more poultry feeds and chicks for resale, and will help Juliet to generate greater profits and provide some basic needs for her family. Juliet hopes that in the future she will be able to own a primary school. \n\nJuliet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The loan will be used to buy more soft drinks such as lemonade and passion fruit juice and a fridge for cooling, and will help Rose to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children and also renovate her chicken farm house. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to build her own house. \n\nRose is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

In the near future he hopes to build a home that better accommodates his growing family. \n\nTwo of Santiago and Rebecca\u2019s children are currently of school age. The family hopes to put the kids through school so they can become professionals in their chosen field and get jobs in town. In Belize, schooling is not required past primary (6-14) education, and schools charge tuition for children enrolled in any level of education. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan in order to do maintenance on the farm and expand by transplanting new seedlings. Maintenance includes cleaning and pruning the fields. Cleaning means cutting the underbrush to clear access to trees for harvest and pruning or preparing land for transplanting new trees. Cleaning is a routine activity for farmers living in the lush tropical lowlands and needs to be done three to four times per year. Pruning is the process of cutting the non-productive branches and is necessary to increase yields and prolong the lifetime of a cacao tree. Santiago plans to hire 15 people to help get the work done in one day.

The job will require as many as 30 people working for 10 days. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1281686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"Cacao farm maintenance and on-farm nursery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":99.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863441},{"amount":50.12,"local_amount":95.47,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":99.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098929},{"amount":50.37,"local_amount":95.95,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":100.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971144},{"amount":43.85,"local_amount":83.52,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":87.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751669},{"amount":43.85,"local_amount":83.52,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":87.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993410},{"amount":50.69,"local_amount":96.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-08T09:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255579},{"amount":65.65,"local_amount":125.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":130.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136420},{"amount":51.64,"local_amount":98.36,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":103.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900637},{"amount":51.91,"local_amount":98.87,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":103.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088522},{"amount":67.04,"local_amount":127.71,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":133.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202026}],"funded_date":"2013-01-23T01:55:06Z","paid_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":520301,"name":"Sabas Cristian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don saba de 60 a\u00f1os de edad,  un humilde habitante de la Comarca San Gabriel, en las afueras de Teustepe, casada, padre de 4 hijos ya son independiente, de oficio agricultor, se dedica a la siembra de ma\u00edz y frijoles y a la ganader\u00eda.

Gabino says the family will continue farming cacao, and they have reason to be proud of their product. \n\nGabino\u2019s enthusiasm for cacao farming is contagious, he told us, as he recently got his brother to start and enjoy farming alongside his town job. Gabino is requesting this loan to hire two people for two weeks to help him clean and prune his 600 bearing cacao trees and clear access to the 500 trees newly planted in June. Besides the benefit of clearing access to the cacao trees, cutting the underbrush has the side benefit of producing firewood that can be used for the daily cooking activities.

Transplanting means planting into the ground cacao seedlings that are typically raised in special bags for at least six months prior.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1281745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"Clean, prune and expand cacao farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cifriano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863447},{"amount":26.26,"local_amount":47.74,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098935},{"amount":26.39,"local_amount":47.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971150},{"amount":26.52,"local_amount":48.22,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751675},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":48.45,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":53.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993416},{"amount":26.78,"local_amount":48.7,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-08T09:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":53.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255585},{"amount":26.92,"local_amount":48.95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":53.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136426},{"amount":27.05,"local_amount":49.18,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":53.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900643},{"amount":27.19,"local_amount":49.44,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":54.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088527},{"amount":35.12,"local_amount":63.84,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":70.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673267}],"funded_date":"2013-01-23T01:01:11Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":520294,"name":"Epiphanio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epiphanio and his wife Romelia have four children, all of whom are currently in school.

Honorato says cacao is a good crop because it\u2019s long term: \u201cyou don\u2019t have to replant it, just clean, prune and take good care.\u201d The tricky part of cacao farming for Honorato has been the fungal pod rot disease Monilia, and the trees that go straight up without producing. \u201cWe call them suckers, because they suck the top of the soil without giving anything back,\u201d he professed.  \n\nHis favorite thing about cacao is the moment after the trees are cleaned and pruned. \u201cThen I really appreciate my field. Trees are looking nice and sailing with the breeze,\u201d Honorato says with a smile, adding that harvest is also a fun time. \n\nWith children between the ages of four and 17, and possibly one more in the planning, there are school fees to worry about. However, kids are indispensable assistants to help out at harvest. Macrina also helps with harvest, but also fermenting and drying as well as shelling and grinding cacao for the hot cacao drink that is omnipresent in Mayan homes. Honorato is asking for the loan to expand his farm by buying and transplanting 600 seedlings as well as cleaning two acres of cacao. Transplanting means planting seedlings raised in bags for at least six months into freshly cleaned soil. Cleaning is the process of cutting underbrush to clear access to trees for pruning and harvest or prepare soil for planting. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1281729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"Clean 2 acres of cacao farm and transplant new seedlings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Honorato","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863445},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098933},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971148},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751673},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993414},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-08T09:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255583},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136424},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900641},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088525},{"amount":21.64,"local_amount":39.35,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":43.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202029},{"amount":47.09,"local_amount":85.62,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":93.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673266}],"funded_date":"2013-01-23T01:11:21Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":520314,"name":"Firmo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Firmo, his wife Veronica and their eight children \u2013 aged two to 17 \u2013 live in the village of Pueblo Viejo.

He is requesting this loan to transplant 175 trees and clean his productive plants. Cleaning is a routine activity for cacao farmers working the land in the lush tropical lowlands.

Six of the kids are currently in school. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best to send them to school. I can do the farming, they can go,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao. If everything goes well in the farm, in the near future Firmo hopes to invest in a solar panel.

Pueblo Viejo is surrounded by mountains, and Firmo, like many of his counterparts, has to climb a steep hill to get to his farm. Living close to the Guatemalan border, Firmo speaks some Spanish, his native Maya Mopan language, Q'eqchi' and English.

She is married to Abraham, a tricycle driver. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarilyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 50,000 PHP to help her in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes that her variety store will become a grocery store. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

comunidad a la cual pertenece, alcanz\u00f3 a terminar la escuela primaria. Tiene 2 hijos a quienes visita con cierta frecuencia. Vive en la casa de familiares en el cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. Jos\u00e9 reside en la Parroquia Puerto Lim\u00f3n de este cant\u00f3n, un sector que fue habitado por una comunidad ts\u00e1chila y tiene varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos. Adem\u00e1s los habitantes de esta parroquia en su gran mayor\u00eda, se dedican a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda.\nJos\u00e9 se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de cacao y pl\u00e1tano verde. Aprendi\u00f3 con sus padres desde que era un ni\u00f1o y la puso en pr\u00e1ctica desde hace 8 a\u00f1os cuando emprendi\u00f3 con los cultivos y la venta de su fruto. Jos\u00e9 es un hombre eminentemente campesino,  trabaja d\u00eda a d\u00eda y es poseedor de una incansable e inagotable fuerza de trabajo, su gran obst\u00e1culo para que crezca su negocio se encontr\u00f3 en la dificultad de obtener pr\u00e9stamos en entidades financieras porque a\u00fan no ha podido obtener las escrituras que avalan la finca de su propiedad, pues est\u00e1 dentro de una comunidad ts\u00e1chila por lo que ha tenido problemas pero sin embargo no ha sucumbido ante las inclemencias clim\u00e1ticas, econ\u00f3micas y sociales, es por esto que Jos\u00e9 requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para poder realizar una resiembra de sus cultivos de pl\u00e1tano verde que es muy cotizado en la zona para venderlo en el mercado pues las amas de casa lo preparan cocinado, frito, en pastel o muchas formas m\u00e1s que deleitan el paladar nacional e internacional. Jos\u00e9 agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por la confianza brindada, pues ya es la segunda vez que le otorgan un cr\u00e9dito, por lo que se puede apreciar que adem\u00e1s Jos\u00e9 es un cliente muy cumplido en sus pagos. ","en":"Jos\u00e9, 22, is a single young man who, following the customs and traditions of his community, finished primary school.  He has two children, whom he visits with some frequency.  He lives in the house of some relatives in Santo Domingo Canton in the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas.\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo connects the mountain and coastal regions of Ecuador.  It's a city that has become a commercial crossroads with several developing sectors. As proof of this, there are many enterprising families here who started out with small businesses a few years ago and now are micro-business owners who generate employment. Studies show that all the businesses for the most part started out empirically and have been well-received by tourists, businessmen, and travelers who go from one region to the other.  In addition, this is the country\u2019s third most populous city.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 lives in Puerto Lim\u00f3n Parish in this canton, an area that was inhabited by a Ts\u00e1chila community and has several tourist attractions.  In addition, the vast majority of residents in this parish make a living in agriculture and livestock.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 makes a living growing cacao and green plantains, which he learned from his parents at a young age and started doing eight years ago when he started growing and selling his fruit.  Jos\u00e9 is a consummate farmer.  He works every day and has an untiring and inexhaustible energy for work.\r\n\r\nHis big obstacle is that, for his business to grow, he had difficulty getting loans from financial institutions because he still hasn't gotten the papers that guarantee the farm he owns, which is within a Ts\u00e1chila community so he has had problems.  Nevertheless, he has not succumbed to weather, economic, and social harshness.\r\n\r\nThis is why he needs a loan to be able to replant his green plantain crops, which is highly valued in the area for sale in the market because the housewives prepare it cooked, fried, in pastry, or in many other forms that please the national and international palate.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9's grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for their confidence in him, because this is the second time they have given him a loan.  This shows that Jos\u00e9 is also a client who makes his payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1281706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP to help her in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nTeresita hopes that her business will grow and expand. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1281786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages to re-sell in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1083.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484707},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2132.98,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037216},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781734},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2709,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488626}],"funded_date":"2013-01-23T03:12:06Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":520328,"name":"Celia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of 12 children, Celia works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fish vending business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from a general store.

He has been providing transportation services to local people using his own minivan since 2006. The minivan he uses for transportation is purchased with a leasing service. His son is 12 years old and goes to high school. Last year he began building a large family house on the plot of land. The house will be complete this summer because using his previous loan he purchased cement, bricks, planks and sand. However due to a lack of finances, he can\u2019t afford to pay all the construction costs. He is now requesting a loan of 4,150,000 MNT to cover the costs related to building his house. These costs include but are not limited to paying workers, installing a heating and conditioner system and connecting to an electricity line. As a result, he and his family will be able to live in their long awaited house with happiness. Most importantly, the high quality house will have an impact on coal usage due to its heat preserving feature. Burning less coal has considerable positive effects on efforts against air
