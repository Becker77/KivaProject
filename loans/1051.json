","en":"Mayramjon is a 35-year-old woman. She is married and has 3 children. Her occupation is manufacturing traditional baby cradles. This is a family business: Mayramjon's husband builds the cradles, while she paints and varnishes them. The family makes very attractive and high-quality products and has many regional customers who make large-volume purchases of the cradles.

He is requesting a loan which he will use to purchase a mini-bus. With his mini-bus, he will transport passengers between Amamlo and Baku. He will also transport fruits and vegetables from his village and sell them in Baku for a good price. His loan request was approved in the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program will provide business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and who are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, the income of the family will increase and they will be able to improve their living conditions.

Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Pati will open her own beauty salon at her house. She will purchase all the instruments and furniture. As she has been working for 15 years as a cosmetician, she has many customers. This will increase her income to serve clients at her home.

His loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \n\nMerab and his son work as artisans and get a monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \n\nMerab requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low incomes. \n\nWith the received credit, Merab will purchase a car. After purchasing a car, he plans to serve local people as a taxi driver. This will increase the income of the family.

He is from the town of Tiribe, located in the coastal zone of the country. He is known for being responsible, hardworking, of good habits, and with a desire to personally succeed.\r\n\r\nPiru has been selling petrol and diesel for the past three years.

She is married and the mother of two children. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Sarah is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nSarah has five years experience with the small, home based sewing and tailoring business activity, making custom order dresses and other small fabric household items. She would like to improve her work conditions by renewing her work area that needs some renovation in order to be more pleasant. To be able to pay for the work she took a loan from Kiva partner Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

She has five years experience with her shop and she is proud of her achievements. She is constantly working on improving the services and general experience for her customers. In the past, she took a loan which she used to buy mirrors for the salon, an A\/C unit and some small decorations for the shop. Having successfully repaid that loan, she is now taking a new loan to buy a small generator for the shop which will make it easier for her to work during the hours when the city power is off.

Several times, Sopiko has applied for loans from local financial institutions for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and lack of experience in her new business. The local credit providers usually insist on prior experience in the business. One source of income for the family is the small monthly income earned by Sopiko, who is involved in a clothing trading business. She buys used clothing and resells these items to her neighbors. Aside from that, her husband works as a taxi driver. Sopiko requested a loan from Credo to start up her own store to sell clothing herself. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start credits on soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. Sopiko will purchase building materials and build a store. She will buy used clothes for wholesale prices and resell them in her store for a profit. It will be hard work for Sopiko, but, according to estimates, her business will be profitable and will increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in clothing to increase her trading stock and sales volume. Sopiko awaits your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1282165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

They are very pleased to inform you that their previous Kiva loan has made a huge impact in their businesses and personal lives. With the help of that loan, they were able to add to their business inventories. This led to an increase in sales and profit. They used the profit they made to repay the loan, feed their children and send them to school.\r\n\r\nHaving repaid the previous loan successfully, they are requesting a new loan now, of SLL 700,000 for each member, in order to further improve on the quality and quantity of the respective businesses.\r\n\r\nThe featured leader, Aminata, is going to use her share of the loan to buy a large quantity of fish to add to her current stock of fish.

One of Toledo\u2019s most beautiful spots, Blue Creek is surrounded by mountains and rests atop of an underground water cave of over 5 miles. The few tourists that pass by Toledo most often pay a visit to Blue Creek to swim down the cave and see its numerous waterfalls. \n\nSilvano and Delfina have brought up six children, the youngest of whom is now 20. All of them have professional jobs in town whether it is in teaching, tourism or civil service. Delfina makes crafts such as bracelets and necklaces to sell to passerby tourists, and the family has opened their doors for homestays. Besides growing cacao, Silvano is also a medicinal healer of the Q\u2019eqhci\u2019 tradition. He cultivates over an acre of medicinal plants he uses in healing practices and opens for medicinal trail tours. \n\nThe family is requesting the loan in order to double the capacity of the 2 acre and 800-plant cacao farm. Silvano says he is ready to be able to enjoy his house and farm, whereas now he still has to move around considerably for his tourism-linked activities. \u201cI enjoy everything about being a farmer, I like to work,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao, confessing that he\u2019s also looking forward to the days he gets to just sit around the farm. The more challenging part of cacao farming for Silvano are the many critters after the plant \u2013 if not the rodents chewing on the roots, you have to worry about leaf-cutter ants and birds as well as squirrels that often get to the fruit before farmers do. \n\nThe loan will be used to set up an on-farm nursery and raise seedlings for the said expansion. Seedlings are cacao trees grown in bags for at least six months to get them ready for transplanting in the ground. Once planted, cacao trees take three to five years to start producing depending on the breed and whether the trees are grafted. Grafting is the process of inserting the tissue of one seedling into another and results in more productive trees that start yielding pods sooner than their non-grafted counterparts.

This is Sidi, who is taking a loan from KOMAZA to plant a small-scale tree farm. Sidi is married to Runya, and the couple practices farming on their land in Chasimba. They grow maize, cow peas, coconuts, and tangerines. Sidi says that pests are destroying her maize, making the harvest small, and that the tangerine trees are also affected by the pests. \r\nWhen asked why she decided to join KOMAZA, Sidi replied that she hopes that it will bring development to her home and to her family, thereby increasing her living standard. \r\nIf her KOMAZA trees grow big, she is hoping to get money to build a good home to replace the mud home in which she currently lives. She would also like to purchase cows to start producing milk for her family and to sell, and to modernize her farming techniques.\r\nShe says that if the trees are sold, she is sure that they will bring a big difference with the income that they generate, and that she will be able to do anything that she wishes. For example, she would like to have a big house to rent to earn an income, since she is getting old. \r\nSidi is pictured here with her husband, Runya. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1272294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase inputs like eucalyptus seedlings and fertilizer, as well as to pay for technical trainings and plantation maintenance support","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chasimba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":282,"posted_date":"2013-01-24T00:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-23T00:00:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sidi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":122,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2023-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2023-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-28T09:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439762867}],"funded_date":"2013-01-24T01:42:35Z","paid_date":"2014-01-28T09:38:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":518496,"name":"Remus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remus is a forty-one-year-old farmer who lives in Chasimba.

He is married and the father of four adult children on their own.  He is a merchant, sells quarried stone and has done so for 20 years.  He started as a merchant and then with the help of his friend he rented a truck so that he could go out to sell the stones in different departments.  Then with the help of his friend he was able to buy his first truck with the money generated from this business.  Now he has two trucks and he works them with his children and two helpers who go out to sell to other places.\r\n\r\nRamon is asking for this loan to buy tires, batteries, and lights; all the supplies he needs to be able to maintain his trucks.

ambitious young woman. She is 21 years old, single, and lives with her parents and sister. Munira would have liked very much to enroll in university after graduating from high school, but her parents had no money to pay her tuition. Now, she has decided to start her own livestock business and achieve success in this endeavour. To this end, Munira took the course \"Succeed\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained her graduation certificate. This course gave her a lot of useful information. Munira has written her business plan and is now certain that she can launch her own business. She will purchase livestock, tend it for several months, and then re-sell it at the local market at a higher price. She plans to use her profits to help her parents improve the family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nMunira is requesting a loan of 3000 somoni to purchase livestock for her new business. She is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1281255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Previously, he and his wife worked at a poultry farm as simple labourers. However, the farm closed and many people were laid off, including Halimjon. At the time, he was already engaged in raising cattle at home and selling his animals at a market. However, having lost his employment, he decided to travel to Russia to find work there, while his wife and son continued to look after the animals. Unfortunately, Halimjon was unable to find good employment opportunities abroad, and was forced to return to his home village.\r\n\r\nHalimjon has decided to invest all his efforts in his cattle business, since it is the only activity that earns him an income. Recently, he discovered that MDO Arvand is in a partnership with Kiva, and that he can obtain a Kiva loan and realize his plans. Halimjon applied for a loan, which he will use to purchase cattle and expand the size of his herd. He thanks Kiva for their financial support and assistance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1280437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLilibeth operates a buy and sell business. She buys general merchandise from wholesalers, then sells them with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances and other such products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices, and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP2,000 in sales weekly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP36,000. She will use the loan to buy additional quantities and varieties of products like washing machines, thermos, rice cookers, and water dispensors to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLilibeth dreams of having a stall in the market, and hopes to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and she draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married to Elyas, who is a vendor, and a mother to their children. Together with her husband, Saipa manages her household while operating her \"ukay-ukay\" business. She works hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. Saipa  sells used clothing that is presented stacked up on a table or mat, although special clothing is displayed in hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls because they are much cheaper than brand new clothes sold in malls. Since Saipa's stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes and she earns a minimum of 300 PHP each day. \r\n\r\nSaipa is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan to buy additional stock of used-but-quality shirts, shorts, blouses, and pants to expand her business. Customers are attracted to \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls as they have lots of clothes to choose from. Saipa plans to add more pants or jeans, used bags, and footwear. She plans to use the profits from her loan to meet customer demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, Saipa will expand her business and boost her income.\r\n\r\nSaipa hopes her business will grow and she will have her own stall.

She is married to J Guadalupe, a construction worker, and they have six children, only one of whom is still a dependent. \r\n\r\nFidelina is applying to the institution for a loan to buy more plastic merchandise such as colanders, buckets, trays, tongs, and glasses. She has been in this business for two years. She started it because no one in her area sold plastic items, so it seemed like a good idea. Over time, she brought more items to the city to sell, as there were more customers there than in her town. She works very hard selling her products door-to-door and is always looking for ways to help her husband pay the household expenses. She also has a stand in the city where she sells Mexican snacks every afternoon, and she raises chickens and turkeys.\r\n\r\nFidelina says, \u201cI like to sell and have contact with the customers. I have no trouble selling what I have on hand, though I would like to increase my earnings so that I can help my son with rehabilitation to help him walk, our greatest wish as parents.\" The other members are Jorge Daniel, who will invest in his grocery store, and Karla, who sells plastic items.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1280990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastic items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Calvario Buenavista, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-24T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-23T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Fidelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karla Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":318.75,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4043.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199265},{"amount":318.75,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4043.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596059},{"amount":478.13,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6065.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663486},{"amount":159.37,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048904}],"funded_date":"2013-01-24T16:20:14Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:54:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":520831,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is a 33-year-old clothes dealer in Bamburi, Mombasa.

May God bless UGAFODE.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1282730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"To buy seedlings for the nursery bed, buy organic fertilizers, and hire labour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-01-24T18:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-23T18:10:14Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":128652.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347362498},{"amount":47.91,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":128652.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589717},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":128652.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993676},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":128652.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040382},{"amount":47.91,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":128652.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831018},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":128652.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689258},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":128652.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480410},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":643263.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459234077}],"funded_date":"2013-01-24T19:46:38Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":520868,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria, age 62, has a restaurant business in the Philippines.

I started both these businesses with the small capital I earned from selling coffee and bananas.\r\n\r\n\"I was advised to get financial assistance from a financial institution since I wanted to buy a new motorcycle. I immediately joined UGAFODE Microfinance Limited (MDI) in 2011 because it was well spoken-of in our community. UGAFODE advanced me an Asset Acquisition Loan in 2011 to buy a new motorcycle, and I have been able to improve and increase my earnings since then. I have been able to pay for my children\u2019s school fees and maintain a stable family.\r\n\r\nIt is through UGAFODE that I have managed to accomplish this and I see that in a very short time my dream will come true: to graduate from a boda-boda (motorcycle) to a motor vehicle.\r\n\r\nI thank UGAFODE for its good services.\"\r\n\r\nAggrey is requesting a loan in order to buy inventory items for his retail shop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1282724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy inventory items for his retail shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-01-24T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-23T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aggrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":128415.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347362499},{"amount":47.91,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":128415.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589718},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":128415.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993677},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":128415.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040383},{"amount":47.91,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":128415.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831019},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":128415.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689259},{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":770494.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459234078}],"funded_date":"2013-01-25T15:20:51Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":520876,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is from Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental.

He wants to re-start his own bakery, but his loan requests have always been rejected in the past because of his lack of experience, which is usually required by local credit providers. Vugar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Vugar will purchase a dough breaker and will knead dough.  He will bake traditional Georgian bread and sell it for a good price. He owns a commercial space and he hopes his project will be profitable as he already has the baking experience and will offer quality products to his customers. This will increase his sales volume.

She relates that the first thing they do is buy white silver that they melt down to then calibrate the numbers they or their customers require and then make the items.  Luisa comments that in order to make a bell, for example, it takes about a week because it requires several types of arrangements.  She relates that in the month of December she was able to sell three bells to one of Banamex Bank\u2019s foundations.  Luisa says that she likes her activity very much but the only problem is her eyesight that makes it more difficult each time to make a good piece.  She wouldn't want to stop making crafts and would also like her children to learn how to make this type of craft in order to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group members are very happy and grateful to the institution and to KIVA because they will be able to invest in their businesses.

In 2007, Nazgul and her husband used 10,000 KGS to start farming to supplement their income.  Because of her hard work, Nazgul now has two cows, ten sheep, one horse, and 2.4 hectares of arable land on her farm. The farm's monthly income from crops and livestock is about 7,500 KGS. In order to further expand her business, Nazgul turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 KGS to buy one cow and tractor parts. The tractor must be ready for the spring plowing. Nazgul plans to invest the income from the loan into expanding her business by buying more cattle and into improving the family's standard of living. Nazgul's primary goal is to raise her children and give them a good education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1281876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase

She is 23 years old, she is not married and lives with her parents.  For now she does not want to get married, she wants to work and be independent.\r\n\r\nMahina is a hairdresser by profession.  She has been in this business for around 3 years.  She has a salon that she rents.  The salon is far from her home and it is very difficult for her to get there on foot because the minibus does not go there.  Mahina successfully finished a driving course several years ago and got her license.  Having discussed it with her parents she decided to buy an inexpensive car.  \r\n\r\nMahina plans to use the loan to buy a car and thanks KIVA in advance for its help and support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1278178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

grows a variety of agricultural crops. He has ten hectares of land where he mostly grows onions and wheat. In addition, he grows carrots, potatoes and feed crops. Last year's harvest was a success and he was pleased that he successfully sold everything. But he had difficulty with transporting the harvest because he did not have a car.  He has been saving up but still does not have enough money. He therefore appealed to Arvand for financial support. Saydullo now wants to re-plant the seeds and hopes that this year will bring a harvest as good as last year's. He has saved a little money to buy a car but it is not enough; therefore, he wants to take out a loan to supplement his savings and buy an inexpensive automobile. \r\n\r\nSaydullo is very thankful to KIVA for their financial support and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1278846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-01-24T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-23T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saydullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":326.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":333.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":340.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":340.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325.1,"local_amount":325.1,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":325.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136601},{"amount":332.87,"local_amount":332.87,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":332.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900798},{"amount":342.03,"local_amount":342.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":342.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429549988}],"funded_date":"2013-01-28T06:58:07Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":520926,"name":"Kache","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kache, 44, is a married mother of three children.

Kenjegul's son is studying at the university in Bishkek. One daughter is married, and the youngest daughter in college in Talas. Kenjegul is the primary source of income for her family.  She started her animal husbandry business 16 years ago with 5,000 KGS. Because of Kenjegul and her family's hard work, the farm currently has two dairy cows. In order to further expand her business, Kenjegul turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS to purchase additional cows to increase her revenue from the sale of milk and dairy products. Kenjegul plans to invest the income from the loan in her children's education and the welfare of the family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1281849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase milk cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Pokrovka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-01-24T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-23T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenjegul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3619},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3673},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3774},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3877},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3984},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4093},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4206},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4322},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4441},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4563},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4688},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4760}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.81,"local_amount":3619,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3703.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012536},{"amount":78.97,"local_amount":3673,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3759.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754891},{"amount":81.14,"local_amount":3774,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3862.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458909},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3877,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3967.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863047},{"amount":85.66,"local_amount":3984,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-24T08:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4077.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631576},{"amount":88,"local_amount":4093,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4188.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495463},{"amount":580.07,"local_amount":26980,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":27611.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743700}],"funded_date":"2013-01-25T01:01:49Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T09:34:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":520929,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith is 29 years old, married and has two children.

obst\u00e1culos dif\u00edciles y sus condiciones econ\u00f3micas no siempre fueron las mejores, por lo que tuvo la oportunidad de terminar la primaria y luego ayudar en el trabajo de la casa para obtener el sustento y cubrir las necesidades de todos en casa. Ahora convive con su pareja; un esforzado agricultor, su nombre es Estenio de 54 a\u00f1os que trabaja d\u00eda a d\u00eda en las tierras sin importar la lluvia o el ardiente sol. Mar\u00eda y su pareja tienen un hijo a quien esperan darle lo necesario para que culmine sus estudios satisfactoriamente. Viven en unidad familiar en la Parroquia Puerto Lim\u00f3n del cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo el puerto de intercambio comercial entre las Regiones Costa y Sierra del Ecuador, un sector que fue habitado por una comunidad ts\u00e1chila y tiene varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos. Adem\u00e1s los habitantes de esta parroquia en su gran mayor\u00eda, se dedican a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda. Cada familia de esta zona emprende cada d\u00eda en lo que su tierra ofrece para salir adelante y no desmayar.\nMar\u00eda Isabel en vista de la escasez de oportunidades en el sector privado por su falta de instrucci\u00f3n, se vio en la necesidad de emprender un negocio que consiste en venta de golosinas y comida r\u00e1pida en el bar de un colegio ubicado en la ciudad. Fue desde hace dos a\u00f1os que Mar\u00eda comenz\u00f3 con este reto y ha crecido y ha podido aportar con los gastos de su hogar que en un inicio solo eran cubiertos por su esposo. Ella invierte en esta actividad 8 horas al d\u00eda y luego contin\u00faa con las labores de su hogar que no puede dejarlas de lado. Ahora requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 algunos productos que le permitan surtir su negocio, pero adem\u00e1s comprar\u00e1 un horno tostador con el cual podr\u00e1 preparar alimentos extras que son solicitados por sus j\u00f3venes y adolescentes clientes quienes tienen un paladar exigente al momento de su recreo o tiempo libre. Mar\u00eda espera que sus ingresos mejoren y por ende su calidad de vida. Cuando le preguntamos a ella por qu\u00e9 conf\u00eda en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes le otorgan el cr\u00e9dito, ella respondi\u00f3 que es una entidad que tiene el distintivo de apoyar a gente emprendedora del sector rural, brind\u00e1ndoles apoyo y agilidad sin mayores obst\u00e1culos para cumplir sus sue\u00f1os. Mar\u00eda Isabel env\u00eda saludos a todas las personas alrededor del mundo que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva son c\u00f3mplices de su sue\u00f1o de superaci\u00f3n.","en":"Mar\u00eda Isabel is a 51-year-old woman. Throughout her life she has faced tough obstacles, and her financial situation hasn't always been the best. That's why she completed elementary school and soon thereafter started helping with household chores in order to support herself and fulfill the needs of everyone in the household. She currently lives with her partner - a hardworking farmer named Estenio who's 54 years old and works everyday on the farm, regardless of the rain or the burning sun. Mar\u00eda and her partner have a son and they hope to provide him with what he needs in order to successfully complete his studies. They live in their family home in the parish of Puerto Lim\u00f3n of the canton of Santo Domingo. It's a commercial gateway between the coast and the mountains of Ecuador, an area inhabited by a Ts\u00e1chila community with several tourist attractions. Most of the people who live in this parish work in agriculture and cattle raising. Each family in this area labors everyday on the fruits of their land in order to get ahead and not falter.\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel was faced with poor job opportunities in the private sector due to her lack of education. That's why she felt the need to establish a business consisting of selling snacks and fast food in a bar located in a local school. Mar\u00eda took on this challenge two years ago, and she has grown and has been able to afford her household expenses which her husband used to pay for alone. She works on this business 8 hours a day and afterwards she keeps on doing household chores she can't neglect. She currently requests a loan which she'll use to purchase some merchandise that allows her to stock up her business. Aside from that, she'll purchase a rotisserie with which she'll be able to prepare additional foods that her customers request. Her young and teenage customers have a demanding taste during their recess or free time. Mar\u00eda hopes to improve her profits and therefore her quality of life. When asked about why she trusts Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa - which provides the loan - she answers that it's an institution who has the distinctive trait of supporting enterprising people of rural areas by providing them with support and readiness without further obstacles to achieve their dreams. Mar\u00eda Isabel sends her greetings to all the people around the world who by using Kiva become part of her dream to overcome."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1283168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Luis. Para \u00e9l fue muy duro reponerse de la p\u00e9rdida de su esposa, sin embargo no se dio por vencido y luch\u00f3 por su hijo que qued\u00f3 en orfandad de su madre. Ahora su hijo es un adulto independiente y Luis vive solo  en la  Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, un lugar hist\u00f3rico de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas. \nLuis desde hace 2 a\u00f1os y con la experiencia adquirida en otros trabajos decidi\u00f3 ser un microempresario independiente, vendiendo bloques de cemento que sirven para la construcci\u00f3n de viviendas. Trabaja todo el d\u00eda en esta actividad, mezclando el cemento y preparando los materiales. Ahora requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar materia prima de contado y al por mayor para poder incrementar sus ventas que le dar\u00e1n ingresos para mejorar su estilo de vida. Al preguntar a Jos\u00e9 c\u00f3mo lleg\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para solicitar el cr\u00e9dito que necesita, \u00e9l responde que fue gracias a la recomendaci\u00f3n de un amigo que estaba muy satisfecho con la atenci\u00f3n, asesor\u00eda, agilidad y confianza que le brindaron y se siente muy emocionado al saber que para el crecimiento de su emprendimiento, hay m\u00e1s de una persona involucrada alrededor del mundo gracias al trabajo de intermediaci\u00f3n que hace Kiva en favor de estas personas vulnerables.","en":"Luis is a 54 year old man. He grew up in the countryside with his mother who, with great effort, was able to provide Luis with a primary school education. Getting back on his feet after the loss of his wife was very tough for him. However, he did not give up and struggled on for his son who had lost his mother. Now his son is an independent adult and Luis lives alone in the parish of R\u00edo Verde, an area full of history. \r\n\r\nThe parish is located in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province in Ecuador, which has sustained high growth over the past number of years. The most attractive and interesting feature of Santo Domingo city is its delicious fruit and the local gastronomy. The level of business carried out here is also considerable as it has become an inland hub for commercial activity between the country\u2019s mountain and coastal regions. Furthermore, its many tourist attractions and warm climate make it a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists. For this reason, most of the city\u2019s inhabitants are involved in some form of commercial activity or service for local residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, with the experience he acquired in other jobs, Luis decided to become an independent micro-entrepreneur. He sells cement blocks which are used for residential construction. He works all day in this business, mixing cement and preparing the materials. Now he needs a loan to buy raw materials in cash and wholesale in order to increase his sales. This will provide him with income to improve his quality of life. \r\n\r\nWhen asked how he found Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in order to request the loan that he needs, Luis replied that it was thanks to the recommendation of a friend who was very satisfied with the service, advise and flexibility and trust that he had received. Luis was very excited when he learned that to grow his enterprise there are people around the world who can make a contribution thanks to the intermediary work that Kiva carries out in favour of vulnerable people.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1283194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

Nuriya's children are studying in Bishkek's University.  Nuriya is a very kind and reliable person.  Nuriya works as a teacher in a preschool.  As a source of income for her family, Nuriya raises livestock, having started this business in 2003.  Thanks to Nuriya's hard work, her business started with a sum of 3,000 KGS allows her to have an income of 12,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk.  Today, Nuriya's household has 3 dairy cows.  In order to further grow her business, Nuriya turned to \"Bai-Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase cows to increase the milk amount.  Nuriya plans to invest the profits resulting from the loan into her children's education.  With time they will marry off their son and daughter.
