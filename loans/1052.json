Several times, Emzar has applied for loans from local financial institutions for his business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his low income and lack of experience in his new business. The local credit providers usually insist on prior experience in the business. \r\n\r\nEmzar\u2019s loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start credits on soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith the borrowed amount, Emzar will purchase a truck.

It will be hard work for Emzar, but, according to estimates, his business will be profitable and will increase the income of the family.

She also sells different vegetables. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php10,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nMenchie wants to see her business growing and expanding. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

After starting out with 20,000KGS in 2005, the farm now brings in nearly 12,000KGS per month from milk products and resale of livestock.  Thanks to her own tenacity, Gulzat's farm is well-developed.  She has turned to Bai Tushum for a loan of 60,000KGS so she can further develop the business by purchasing feed for her sheep.  She plans to put money into growing the business by getting more head of livestock.

","en":"Chynarkul is 51 years old. She has raised 5 children, all of whom are now grown-up, and only her youngest son continues to live with his parents and help his mother. As the main source of income for her family, Chynarkul has been farming and raising livestock for the past 30 years, having started this business practically from zero. Thanks to her hard work, Chynarkul's herd currently includes 2 dairy cows and 4 sheep and goats, and her business's monthly profits amount to approximately 20,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nChynarkul needs to develop her business and increase her profits. With this in mind, she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 85,000 som (KGS) to buy additional cows in order to increase her income from sales of milk and dairy products. Chynarkul plans to invest her profits from this loan into further development of her

He has been doing this for a long time and this is how he earns an honest living. He is a very responsible man, honest and dedicated to his work. He is well known among his neighbours who say good things about both his work and his character. Every year he does this since he is a very humble person and not well off, so he cannot have any other kind of business or work.\r\n\r\nThis year, like the ones before, he has decided to cultivate the land and since the sowing season is near he wants to be prepared with the agricultural supplies he needs to grow the main basic grains. This is why he is asking for this loan from INTEGRAL, since he cannot afford the investment. He will invest the loan in buying agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizer, insecticides, etc. In this way he hopes he will be able to grow the main basic grains this year and be able to feed his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1283874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizer, insecticide, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-01-25T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-24T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodoro Alfredo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":395,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":395}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":317.53,"local_amount":313.56,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":317.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":441330522},{"amount":82.47,"local_amount":81.44,"processed_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":82.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450361272}],"funded_date":"2013-01-26T07:40:40Z","paid_date":"2014-02-21T09:36:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Brown","image":1233582}},{"id":521257,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is a married lady aged 34 years and supports a family of five members.

She is married to Salvador, and mother to her children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRosie operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from round, palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales, every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy a greater quantity of raw materials, like fabric, thread, and other materials for rug-making. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosie hopes to increase production and expand her business. She dreams of helping her grandchildren with their studies. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Single, she lives with her parents and helps them manage their household. She is also helping in generating income for their family. They have had this business for seven years now, and it is continuously growing.\r\n\r\nRose operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells different vegetables. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nRose hopes to make her variety store a grocery store and dreams to become rich. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1283517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-01-25T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-24T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1353.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484728},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.02,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2709.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037237},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.98,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2708.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781755},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2707.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488645},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":677.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894281}],"funded_date":"2013-01-25T19:22:54Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":521262,"name":"Charles Wani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles is a 45-year-old businessman who lives in Juba.

His wish to get ahead in life has always been great; he is responsible, honest, straightforward, hardworking and enterprising.\r\n\r\nDavid earns his living growing basic grains such as maize and beans. As well, when there is not much work on his farm, he takes on jobs as a day laborer. Farming has been his principal source of income for several years, and he has put in a lot of effort and dedication. He now wishes to buy basic agricultural supplies so that his crops aren\u2019t ruined. For this reason he has approached INTEGRAL to ask for a loan to buy manure, fertilizer, pesticides etc. He hopes that he will be granted a loan as he has good references and expects to pay back the money early.

She began her business with the expectation that, while she was earning money, she would participate in educating and raising her children, and caring for her husband.\r\n\r\nWith her business, she has been able to help with household expenses.  Little by little, in addition to medications, she has been adding miscellaneous items, which she sells for cash in a shop located in her home in the south-west of the city of Barranquilla.  Her work starts from 7 in the morning to 9 at night, from Monday to Sunday.  This great effort helps her business grow, allowing her to become established in the community of her target market.\r\n\r\nFor 3 years, she has been connected with the programs of the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, in which she has felt supported.  She has had 3 loans, with which she has expanded her business and increased the variety of products for sale.\r\n\r\nYudis, with her conscientious work, has lofty goals focused on improving the quality of life for herself and her family, but she needs her business to be even more profitable, offering a great variety of products that sell quickly.  This is precisely the reason why she is applying for a Kiva loan, her fourth loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She will use it to buy pharmaceutical products that have high turnover, because they generate a profit volume that allows her to increase her working capital, in order to reinvest it and earn even more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1283886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy pharmaceutical products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-01-25T17:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-24T17:50:19Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yudis Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82685},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84615},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86589},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88609},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90677},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":92793},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94958},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":97174},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99441},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":101761},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":104136},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":106562}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.56,"local_amount":82685,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":84683.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071732},{"amount":48.67,"local_amount":84615,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":86659.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497948},{"amount":49.81,"local_amount":86589,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88681.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527762},{"amount":50.97,"local_amount":88609,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":90750.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928509},{"amount":52.16,"local_amount":90677,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":92868.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705661},{"amount":53.38,"local_amount":92793,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":95035.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967953},{"amount":54.62,"local_amount":94958,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":97252.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817148},{"amount":55.9,"local_amount":97174,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":99522.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323425},{"amount":57.2,"local_amount":99441,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":101844.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082670},{"amount":179.73,"local_amount":312459,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":320009.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062058}],"funded_date":"2013-01-25T21:00:00Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:27:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deepa R.","image":null}},{"id":521293,"name":"Angie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angie lives in Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental.

After two years, she increased her farm, having started with only 20 ducks and now raising almost 100 ducks. Dian enjoys this business because ducks are easily maintained; they leave and come home by themselves.\r\n \r\n<p>Dian and her group are requesting financial support from VisionFund Indonesia for the 2nd time so that they can increase their working capital . Dian will use this loan to buy duck food and to repair the coop. Dian's main obstacle in running this business is the rainy season, which produces many caterpillars which the ducks eat, whereupon they get sick and die. Dian dreams of sending her child to the doctor faculty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1282079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. Since 2002, Enkhbaatar has been providing hairdressing services to local people. His wife offers the same services in another barber shop. Their 2-year-old son goes to pre-school. \r\n\r\n<p>In autumn 2012, the family began building their own house with planks. Due to lack of finances, the interior work is not complete so Enkhbaatar is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT to purchase construction materials such as cement, gypsum, panels, etc. As a result, the family can live in a more comfortable and warm place. Enkhbaatar used his previous loan to open another barber shop and repaid the loan on an established schedule. He is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

When asked \"How will this loan benefit your family?\" Stanley replied \"better nutrition and more disposable income.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Stanley owns the following: \"cow, motorcycle\" but does not own \"pig, poultry, pump, bicycle, automobile.\" Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household \"mosquito net, solar power, TV\" but does not have \"electricity, running water, sewing machine, DVD.\"\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used

","en":"Jusufjon is a young man, married, with three children. He manufactures modular  bricks and also sells coal. In the wintertime the demand for coal is high, and he earns a good income from his business. Jusufjon is very energetic, and always tries to find work and earn a living. He has many dreams: for example, he would really like for his children to receive a college education. He would like to renovate his house, which has not been renovated for many years, and live in decent conditions. In order to realize these plans, he works a lot.

runners. She has three children.  Her primary income sources are selling milk and growing crops, and she has been doing this work for 13 years. \r\n\r\nShe stated that what was most enjoyable about farming was 'selling milk to cater for the needs of the family!'  Her biggest challenges are 'the high costs of feeding the animals especially during the dry season.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Lelbonget.'\r\n\r\nJane  will use the loan amount to buy and insure a dairy cow. She was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, 'I was introduced to Juhudi by a friend in the group ...'  Jane was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session and replied, 'how to use credit assets to generate income to repay the credit and to develop oneself.'\r\n\r\nJane's largest monthly expense is farming costs. When she was asked, 'how will this loan benefit your family?' Jane replied, 'more income and nutrients for the family  from the milk produced.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jane owns the following: 'cow and poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower does not have 'mosquito net, electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and sent the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs down.\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1283727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is married and has five children which are all in school. She sells green bananas and charcoal at the market on a retail basis. She has no additional family members. She has been in this business for the last 10 years. She works seven days a week. Her major business challenges are transportation and seasonality. She has requested a loan of 300,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy more bags of charcoal.

unit.  He lives in the Nyamira area of Kenya, which is a popular banana growing region. He has 1 child and has been farming for 3 years. His primary income sources are eggs, tea, crops, dairy, and transportation services.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \u201cPlanting tomatoes, they yield so fast!\u201d His biggest challenge is \u201cRearing chicken due to the risk.\u201d Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Nyabarati.'\r\n\r\nBenard was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied that the repayment period is favorable, and the installments are fair.  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \u201cThat they give even very small loans.\u201d\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Benard replied that his income will increase thus giving them a better lifestyle.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Benard owns the following: 'cow, poultry, pump, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, solar power' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine, DVD, TV'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

She has 7 children and has been farming for 20 years. Her primary income sources are eggs, tea, and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated that the most enjoyable thing about farming is the benefits during harvesting! Her biggest challenge is securing financing. The animals at the farm are named \u201cImburi\". She will use the loan to buy poultry birds.\r\n\r\nZipporah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied that they charge reasonable interest rates.  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session which she responsed, the loaning process and requirements for the organization.\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

She is single with three children, and one of her children goes to school. She sells charcoal, tomatoes and green bananas at the market on a retail basis. She takes care of three additional family members. She has been in this business for the last 6 years. She works seven days a week. Her major challenges are transportation and seasonality. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 200,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy bags of charcoal and bunches of green bananas.

He has 3 children and has been doing this work for 15 years.  His primary income sources are milk, tea, transportation services and his personal business.\r\n\r\nHe responded that what is most enjoyable about farming is 'earning the returns!' His biggest challenge is 'looking for finances'. He has named his animal 'Ingombe.' He will use the loan to buy insecticides and to grow trees around his horticultural farm to protect the crops from occasional strong winds.\r\n\r\nCharles was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'the reasonable interest charges.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. His response was 'Loaning.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Charles replied 'Increase the family income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Charles owns the following: 'cow, poultry, motorcycle', but he does not own: 'pig, pump, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household: 'mosquito net, solar power' but does not have: 'electricity, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

She has 4 children and has been farming for 15 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is keeping dairy animals and having them be a source of income to the family for a long time. Earning from selling milk derives satisfaction. Her biggest challenge is a lack of modern training on how to keep dairy animals and to optimize their production. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Maridadi and Tausi.\r\n\r\nSally was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied that she learned of Juhudi from a friend after a marketing team from Juhudi visited Ndalat.  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.  Her answer was: How to work in groups, acquire assets through group lending and repay the loan.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked, how will this loan benefit your family?, Sally replied there will be more income from milk sales due to increased production.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Sally owns the following: cow, and poultry but does not own pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household mosquito net, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1283901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy and insure a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-01-26T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-25T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sally","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3738.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3837.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3939.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4043.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4150.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4259.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4372.43},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4488.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4606.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4728.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4853.43},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4982.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.14,"local_amount":3825.47,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T08:56:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3855.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347304996},{"amount":45.31,"local_amount":3926.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3957.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355846201},{"amount":46.5,"local_amount":4030.38,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4062.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768584},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":4136.92,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4169.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516650},{"amount":49,"local_amount":4246.27,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4279.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960250},{"amount":367.32,"local_amount":31834.37,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":32085.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417053}],"funded_date":"2013-01-26T16:48:35Z","paid_date":"2013-09-20T08:40:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C Pettersen"}},{"id":521607,"name":"Silva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Silva is from Kapan.

Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1284314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buys seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-01-26T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-25T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.57,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347171028},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-23T09:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913251},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-28T08:51:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364624228},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-29T09:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020228},{"amount":28.74,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.42,"payment_id":381808057},{"amount":28.07,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.1,"payment_id":390668120},{"amount":54.46,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5010.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.87,"payment_id":400621636},{"amount":27.7,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.47,"payment_id":410196519},{"amount":27.1,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.07,"payment_id":419959968},{"amount":27.71,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.46,"payment_id":429613861},{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.18,"payment_id":439840326}],"funded_date":"2013-01-26T18:04:32Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":521756,"name":"Pius","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pius is a 39-year-old married man.

He has been farming for many years, cultivating basic grains such as corn and beans.  He repeats this activity year after year, because this is his main source of income.  Through his farming, he earns a living and feeds his family.  Everano's main dream is to improve the quality of life for himself and his family.  He has always wanted to give his family something different, and this motivates him to work with more enthusiasm, because only with his work can he provide his family with what he so much wants to give them.
