He is married and has a family.  He has been raising livestock since his childhood and learned this occupation from his parents. He raises goats and sheep at home with his family.  His wife and children help him with this business.\r\n\r\nThe price of livestock is quite low right now, but it will get higher in the spring.  This is why Omid would like to buy a few goats and sheep before the spring.  \r\n\r\nOmid truly enjoys the business he is involved in, and he is trying hard to develop it.  \r\n\r\nAlthough he did not go to school and has no formal education, Omid really wishes he did.

She is 45 years old and the mother of one son who attends school.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide a source of income for her family, Kayirkan got involved in animal farming.  She started in this business in 1990 with an initial capital of 1,500 som (KGS).  She now owns two dairy cows, 15 sheep and three young bulls, and she makes close to 12,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and the resale of livestock.\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her farming business, Kayirkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy more livestock.  She is planning to reinvest her revenues from this loan into the expansion of her business and the construction of a barn.  The family's long term plans include buying a car and repairing their

He lives in Baghdati District with wife, mother, brother, sister and an infant daughter. Bejan requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but he had no success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, 2 buffalos and a hectare of agricultural land, where maize is grown. Besides, Bejan owns a vineyard, where 700 wine trees are grown. It is hardly enough to pay for food for the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBejan requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Bejan will purchase building materials. After purchasing building materials, he plans to build a greenhouse. He will sow cucumbers there and sell them locally at a good price. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php20,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nNery hopes to have a good life and dreams of expanding her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They have four children between the ages of 16 and 30.  She started her business when she left Buenaventura, the most important seaport in the Pac\u00edfico Colombiano region.  She arrived in the city to look for better ways of living peacefully and productively for her family.\r\n\r\nMercedes had acquired store experience in her native land.  Once she moved to Barranquilla, she took it up again.  She turned it into her way of generating income.  She was supported by her family, and she was very well-received. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to manage complete sustainability in her business.  To do so, she needs to grow at the same rate as her clientele.  However, she does not have enough inventory to respond to her customers with the merchandise that turns over the most.  \r\n\r\nThis is exactly the reason she turns to a Kiva loan.  This is her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the previous one she bought groceries, snacks, and vegetables in greater volume in order to get discounts.  This capitalized her business a little more.  Now she will look to make it more profitable because she has added cell phone plans and recharges, which means a new income for her. \r\n\r\nShe intends to use part of her Kiva loan to strengthen her communications business by adding new cell plans and recharges.  This is exactly what she will do so that her Kiva loan will be potentially successful.  This is because it will gradually impact the growth of her store with a new service.  She will use the other part of her loan to pay for her daughter\u2019s semester at the university.\r\n\r\nThis is why Mercedas says to her lenders, \u201cThank you for the support.  In my situation of not being from this place, I am managing to get ahead with my family, and this is thanks to Kiva.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1285094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

His wife is a homemaker and is raising their children, but during the free time helps her husband.\r\n\r\nFeeding large horned cattle is their traditional family business. Sirojiddin buys a calf and feeds it during the year and then sells to the butchers who sell it a higher price on the market. At this time the headcount of cattle has decreased because two cows got sick and he had to sell them quickly to the butchers. Now he wants to increase the cattle headcount, feed it and then sells it at spring time for a good profit.\r\n\r\nSirojiddin plans to use the loan to buy large horned cattle and expand his business.

Omar ha tenido que educar solo a sus dos hijos Charly y Ximena de 11 y 7 a\u00f1os respectivamente, ellos son la raz\u00f3n por la cual cada d\u00eda este hombre, sin duda esforzado, se levanta para trabajar duro y as\u00ed llevar el sustento a su hogar. Por varias circunstancias adversas, vive solo con sus hijos en Los Bancos un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Pichincha, una de las provincias  m\u00e1s grandes en la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Este cant\u00f3n se encuentra a pocos kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de Quito, y tiene diversidad de bosques, adem\u00e1s sus barrios est\u00e1n poblados con gente amable y costumbres propias de esta ciudad en donde tambi\u00e9n se encuentran establecidas varias microempresas administradas por los emprendedores que luchan por hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os cada d\u00eda.

","en":"Omar is 31 years old and has been working since he was a child, helping his parents.  However, he never neglected his studies and succeeded in completing secondary school.  Omar has had to bring up his two children alone.  Named Charly (11 years old) and Ximena (seven years), his children are the reason that this strong man gets up to work hard and support the household.  As a result of various bad circumstances, Omar lives alone with his children in the Los Bancos canton, in one of Ecuador's biggest provinces, Pichincha.  Only a few kilometres from the city of Quito, Los Bancos has a variety of forests and its neighbourhoods are filled with friendly people and local traditions.  Many microbusinesses are to be found here, all run by entrepreneurs that fight every day to make their dreams a reality.  Other important industries in the area are agriculture and cattle raising.  This produces an abundance of crops which are later sold and distributed to many different provinces.  The canton also has various tourist attractions such as waterfalls, rivers, paths and seaside resorts where tourists come for adventure sports that can practiced safely here.\r\n\r\nOmar sells wood.  He learned this trade with his parents from a young age and it later became his living.  At the beginning it was difficult to enter the market as obtaining the necessary permits is quite difficult.  However, Omar did not give up and kept going until his business was set up.  Now he has been doing this work for 15 years, working at least ten hours a day locating, carrying, cleaning and polishing wood.  The tools he uses are worn out and he now needs to buy new ones.  For this Omar needs a loan, so he has asked for help from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who, thanks to Kiva and to all of you, will be able to help this father offer a better product to his customers.  As a result, he will increase his customer base and, consequently, his income.  This will allow him to provide his children with an upbringing based on values and excellence so that one day they can contribute to the social and economic growth of Ecuador."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1285108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber

During the last four years, she has managed build up a customer base and now she is very well-known. For this reason, she needs to be able to have a permanent inventory to be able to respond to the market effectively. Starting the business was her husband\u2019s idea, because they needed to generate a new source of income to be more comfortable at home. He saw that there was no one selling beer in their area, and people walked for a long way to get it.

Income and experience are usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the small monthly income earned by Larisa, who is involved in a small-scale trading business. She buys clothing, dishes, cosmetics and different kinds of household items in Turkey and resells these items to nearby villages. \r\n\r\nLarisa requested a loan from Credo to expand her business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor. The rural poor do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nLarisa will purchase more clothing and household items in Turkey at wholesale prices and resell the items for a profit. It will be hard work for Larisa, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and will increase the income of the family.

Alice is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera, in the Masaka region of Uganda. For the past two years, Alice has been working hard to manage the rearing of cattle, whose milk she sells. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Alice has requested a loan of UGX 600,000 (Ugandan Shillings) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more cattle for milk and buckets to collect the milk in and will help Alice to generate greater profits and take care of her family members by providing all the basic needs. Alice hopes that, in the future, she will be able to own many cows that will produce much milk. \r\n\r\nAlice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

After dropping out of school due to lack of tuition, he started his agriculture business to support himself and his family. The income from agriculture was not enough to sustain his family needs, so he started a small scale brick laying business. While in Rukungiri Town one evening, he heard someone talking about UGAFODE Microfinance Limited (MDI) and the next morning he approached the office and he was given the funds to boost his agriculture and brick laying.

 is a married man. He has 5 children. He describes himself to be jovial, dedicated to his work and ambitious. He operates a 'posho' mill business where he mills maize into flour. He has been involved in this business for five years.

She is single with two children and one of them attends school. She does not look after any other family members.\n\nJoan has been operating a salon for six years, working six days a week. She does not have any other source of income.\n\nJoan has requested a loan of UGX 300,000 from MCDT-SACCO to enable her to stock more hair oils, artificial hair, and rollers, and to replace old towels.

is a master weaver from Peru who specializes in the Ayacucho style of tapestries. He would like to invest in the purchase of wool yarn and cotton thread to increase production.\r\n\r\nCerapio has been selling through NOVICA since 2000. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I was forced to leave my home in Ayacucho during the 1980s. Terrorists were bleeding my people to death and there seemed little hope. I inherited my passion for weaving from my parents and grandparents. But the quality of my work is the result of my long experience, and the product of my careful observation over the years. I draw inspiration from our ancient Peruvian cultures, Andean village life, and our snow-capped mountains.'\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to your support, I've grown as an artist, not only through sales, but also by developing many more designs. I thank you for your support with this microcredit.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Cerapio's wool rugs and tapestries on the NOVICA

Diego would like to stock up on raw materials for his hand-carved sculptures and masks and also buy an electric jigsaw. Diego has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I am a Maya woodcarver. At age 10, I left school to help my father work in the fields. Eventually, I began selling wooden masks, then learned to carve and paint them, while still helping my father. I am a devout Catholic, so I then began carving images of saints. Today, I have taught my art to six people, and I have been able to put my children, who are also wood carvers, through school.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful to you because you're helping me a lot.

Cipolla","image":418546}},{"id":522168,"name":"Vangie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After a car accident, Vangie\u2019s insurance company claimed her car was a complete loss and issued funds to replace it. Agreeing to repurchase her car and repair its front suspension per her husband\u2019s suggestion, Vangie was informed her vehicle was up for auction and she would have to bid for it. \r\n\r\nVangie returned with three vehicles from the auction, none of which were her original. She then hired a mechanic to repair them before selling them. The vehicles sold quicker than Vangie expected, so she then decided to continue purchasing vehicles from auctions, creating a new career for herself.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been 15 years since Vangie\u2019s first sale. She now carries 40 to 50 trucks, cars, SUVs, vans, blue title and salvaged-titled cars purchased from auctions at her buy-here-pay-here lot, A & V Auto Sales, located in her hometown of San Antonio.\r\n\r\nCompared to the multiple car lots in San Antonio and its surrounding cities, Vangie says her car lot is different because, \u201cWe try to work with everybody, and if they have problems with their cars after the purchase, we\u2019ll go the extra mile to fix it. If I have the parts, I\u2019ll give them to you, just pay for the labor.\u201d\r\n\r\nVangie has always been an entrepreneur. Her passion to sell began as a child selling various items at yard sales with her mom. As she grew older, Vangie made seasonal trips to Mexico to purchase wrought iron presents to sell in the U.S.A. and earn a small profit during the Christmas season.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Vangie employs two office workers, a salesman and a mechanic. She plans to hire at least one more mechanic in the near future.\r\n\r\nOnce a friend and former Accion Texas Inc. client suggested she inquire about a loan from Accion, she did. Since approved, Vangie says she is able to make ten more payments on her purchased cars. She is also able to purchase more cars before tax season, which is a high vehicle-selling season. She plans to use the rest of her loan for working capital. \r\n\r\nThough she has a successful business, being a used-car salesperson doesn\u2019t automatically guarantee an easy business path. Vangie understands how she has to switch gears when dealing with disgruntled clients. Within her 15 years of service, she says she\u2019s grateful to only have had two unsatisfied clients. \r\n\r\n\u201cI just want to try to sell good cars to people and not have these negative problems,\u201d she says. \u201cI try hard to sell a good car. It\u2019s not in my interest to sell a bad car; I\u2019m not like that. If I feel a car is in bad terms, I\u2019ll fix it. I get under the cars if I have to, and if I hit the wall, I\u2019ll give it to the mechanic.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":1285197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Asaph would like the lender to avail him with funds in future to buy a vehicle that will help to ease transportation of his goods.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1282739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy beans and groundnuts for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kagadi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-01-28T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-27T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asaph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":201369.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347362496},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":201369.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589715},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":201369.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993674},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":201369.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040380},{"amount":150,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":402738.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831016},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":201369.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480408},{"amount":225,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":604108.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459234076}],"funded_date":"2013-02-03T10:44:01Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":520933,"name":"Rosebell","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosebell is a 35-year-old woman dealing in Agricultural Commodities, particularly the coffee trade.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \n\nEmma operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nEmma hopes to expand her business and dreams to have their own house. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the word of God she studies. \n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1283372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for recyclable materials needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-01-28T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-27T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":733,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":744.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484720},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":2934,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2980.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037229},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":3666,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3723.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781747},{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":2267,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2302.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488638},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1422.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467888350}],"funded_date":"2013-01-29T00:26:01Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:33:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":518047,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Julieta tiene un hijo, vive en anticr\u00e9tico ocupando una habitaci\u00f3n con un acabado fino y piso de machimbre, tambi\u00e9n cuenta con una cocina, ba\u00f1o, comedor y sala, la casa esta ubicada en la zona de Escobar Uria de la ciudad de La Paz.\n\nJulieta trabaja de forma independiente realizando tr\u00e1mites por m\u00e1s de ocho horas al d\u00eda, ya que es la \u00fanica que cubre los gastos de agua, luz, alquiler y alimentaci\u00f3n de su familia.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo requiere para la compra de una fotocopiadora ya que es muy necesario en el trabajo que ella realiza.

They are neighbors and friends from Olintepeque City, a 20-minute drive from Quetzaltenango in western Guatemala. Since the group was formed a few years ago, these ingenious women have expanded their businesses and increased their income, which has allowed them to support their families in ways they formerly thought impossible.  \r\n\r\nAs a new member of the group, Eva Maria, is starting her first loan cycle. She is 20 years old and a mother of two boys (a three year-old toddler and a five month-old baby). Both Eva Maria and her husband work to earn money for their family. Her husband is a toy merchant and Eva Maria raises pigs. She currently owns four pigs, but has plans to double that number with the loan she obtained from her involvement in the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank. The increased income will further Eva Maria\u2019s dream of going back to school. Her formal education was interrupted with the birth of her first son when she was in 8th grade, but she is excited about the non-formal education that Friendship Bridge provides with the loans. In the meantime, the money she earns will help ensure her own children complete school.\r\n\r\nAlong with Eva Maria, the ladies of Las Cumplidoras Trust Bank are engaged in various enterprises including sewing, the sale of chickens, fruit, food, and traditional clothing; and the management of a convenience store. On average these women have four children, each of whom they hope to provide a good education and continued good health. These important goals are now in reach because of the monthly training they receive from Friendship Bridge along with their loans. Lessons cover topics such as self-esteem, children's rights, business management, money management, budgeting, and savings.

to receive a loan to increase her livestock count.  She keeps several heads of livestock at home.  This is her main job; in their region raising livestock and growing crops is very realistic, and this is why she takes this business seriously in order to feed her family.  She has a big family and there is not enough work for everyone in the village, many travel to Russia to earn money, but Hafiza does not want to send her family to a foreign country and tries to feed them herself.  This is why she would like to get a loan from Arvand to buy several heads of livestock and to continue to grow her business.

children. Since he has no college degree and   didn\u2019t pursue his studies when he was younger, he raises livestock. From his childhood on, he was aware of the financial difficulties in his family and knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to get a degree. Utkurbek\u2019s father taught him how to raise livestock, and this is the work Utkurbek has been engaged in from a young age. Utkurbek knows all the advantages of this business.\r\n\r\nHe has not renovated his house for a long time, and his living conditions are poor, which is why he would like to save up for house renovations. In order to do this, he plans to buy livestock and expand his business.

He grows vegetables in greenhouses and also performs welding jobs. Last year he used his loan received from Kiva to buy plastic sheeting and seeds.  Fedor had a good harvest.  In addition, he received a lot of orders for welding jobs, which allowed him to make some additional income. At the end of the season Fedor did some calculations and saw that income from welding was higher, but income from his greenhouse - less than expected. \n\nThis year, Fedor is requesting a loan to repair his greenhouses, as well as to buy seeds and fuel for heating.  He plans to redesign a greenhouse (making it more frost-resistant), so that he will be able to harvest earlier and, as a result, to increase his income.\n\nThere has been a minor change in Fedor's family situation: his two daughters have entered first grade.

Her sons are adults now, and her children help her run the farming business.  \r\n\r\nDuring the loan processing period, Satymkan appeared as a responsible, honest, conscientious and enterprising person with a sense of duty.  She also appeared as a good money manager and wise investor.\r\n\r\nSatymkan has been involved in animal husbandry since 1983, and this activity is the family's main source of income.  She started in this business with an initial capital of 500 rubles.  Thanks to her hard work, she now makes close to 17,000 som (KGS) per month, which is essentially used to cover the family's food expenses and daily living costs.\r\n\r\nSatymkan's farming business is doing well: she currently owns four cows, one heifer, 20 sheep and five lambs.\r\n\r\nIn order to further increase her business, Satymkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 45,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy some sheep.  She plans to use the revenues from her loan to further invest in the expansion of her farming business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1283674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul town, Jalalabad region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-01-29T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-28T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Satymkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3749},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3356},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3440},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3526},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3614},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3704},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3797},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3892},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3989},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4089},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4191},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3653}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":3749,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:02:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3773.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012541},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":3356,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3377.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754895},{"amount":72.63,"local_amount":3440,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3462.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458915},{"amount":727.38,"local_amount":34455,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":34677.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863052}],"funded_date":"2013-01-30T00:07:40Z","paid_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":522305,"name":"Gansuh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Gansuh is 33 years old and lives alone in Ger in Bulgan Province of Mongolia.

He and his family live high in the mountains, where it's easy to graze cattle. Shukirali has a large house and property. His family supports his efforts to develop his farming business and, during the summer seasons, helps to grow peanuts and take care of the livestock. Each 5-6 month, Shukirali takes his cows to the market for sale, while sheep are ready every 2 months. In addition to tending livestock, Shukirali works as a construction site painter. However, his livestock business represents his main source of income, which is why he strives to expand it. While he is away, his wife and children look after the animals.\r\n\r\nUsing this loan, Shukirali plans to purchase livestock and expand the size of his herd.

She invested the previous loans into selling of sweets. Even though she put a lot of effort to make her business grow and bring in regular profit the sweets frequently went bad because all of the goods were not sold in time. Because of that Katerina sustained some losses. This is why she decided to entirely change her business model and started to sell women's and children's clothing and by that has increased her income.\r\n\r\nThis time Katerina has come for a loan in the amount of 5,000 hryvnia to buy women's sweaters and children's jackets to sell during the winter season. Right now Katerina is not afraid of losses as before and hopes that she can invest more money into the continuous growth of her own business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1283724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

In particular they have three milk cows and four calves, whose milk is used in cheese production. They also have a plot of agricultural land, where maize and 200 nut trees are grown. It hardly provides enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs in the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nEkaterine requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Ekaterine will trade used clothing.

He has a business where he offers copying services and sells candies and general food. He started his business 1 year ago hoping to generate new income on his own and filling the need in the neighborhood for a copying service. Little by little, he added food, taking into account the potential of the children who had nowhere to go to buy candy because the stores were far away. His goal is to grow and that is why he went to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a Kiva loan, the first loan that he has taken out with this organization. With it, he will buy pastries, candy, cookies and ink for his copier. Luis is a hardworking young man. He starts his working activities around 10 in the morning until 8 at night Monday through Sunday. He does this to improve his quality of life little by little and make his business into his family's main source of income.
