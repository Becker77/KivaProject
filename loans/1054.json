Yosef has never wanted to live off of his parents, and never expected that they would get him a car. He saved his own money and bught the car himself. Now he would like to get a driver's license but has to wait again until he gets enough money. So he has decided to take out a loan.

","en":"Sixta is the mother of 3 children, between 19 and 27 years old. Every day from Monday through Friday, she leaves her house at 7 in the morning and sets up in the doorway of an important business to offer its employees cheese sticks, empanadas, sandwiches, natural juices, arepas, and all kinds of food that her customers usually buy for breakfast. The idea for the business was born because her nephew had this business, but he found a regular job and offered it to Sixta. She took it over 4 years ago and so far it has gone well for her. Sixta stores her products in a plastic basket that she uses to transport them to sell to the workers with a short term credit of two weeks, when they get their paychecks. Other customers also pay her up front, but usually her strength is being able to sell on credit. Sixta also has another sales point where she works all week. It is located very close to her house and there she sells products made from wheat flour. Right now, she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy fruit, vegetables, and flour in larger quantities to increase her production for her customers, because her clientele has grown and she needs to offer more diverse products for consumption. Her goal is to have more working capital to be able to buy in larger quantities in order to obtain discounts. This is just what she will do with her Kiva loan. With it, she hopes to have more success with her profits because her dream is to put a second floor on her house and improve its facilities.

He is engaged in agricultural production, both livestock and crops. He is also a hard-working individual, who depends solely on farming to earn a living and maintain a stable and effective household. His household includes two wives and grandchildren.\r\n\r\nBefore John joined UGAFODE, his business of cow fattening and trading, which he has literally done his whole life, was on a small scale. He used to have from two to five animals at a time, for fattening. He then joined UGAFODE in 2009, with a view toward getting a financial push for his business. He succeeded and began putting funds into his business, and it got him more and more returns.\r\n\r\nWith help in the form of borrowed funds from UGAFODE, John managed to improve on his livestock, by buying modern spraying medicine and food supplements, plus getting the necessary technical help from veterinary doctors.

She has a store in the city center, where she sells used clothing and fabrics to make costumes. \r\n\r\nShe opened her business two years ago, when she began to sell used clothing in Rio Frio, a small town in the department of Magdalena. Rio Frio is a spa town which welcomes many tourists visiting its beautiful cool river, where families meet to spend time together and enjoy themselves. \r\n\r\nLittle by little, Sonia began to make a name for herself and meet customers in the city of Barranquilla, located three hours away. She often traveled there, and this is how she came across the opportunity to set up a stall in the market. Everything grew from there. \r\n\r\nShe sells all kinds of used women's clothing, including jeans, blouses, vests, skirts and pants. She displays them on cords that hang in her store, and this attracts customers' attention because they associate them with a good price. She accepts cash for her goods and works from Mondays to Sundays. A friend of hers chooses and buys clothes from all over the city for her to sell in her store, and Sonia buys fresh stock three times a week. She also sells fabrics to make costumes. This is a successful business in the season leading up to Carnival, because the celebrations attract all types of buyers who want to make their own costumes.  \r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that she is requesting a loan from Kiva, to buy fabrics for costumes and used clothing, which will increase her selling potential and guarantee that her investment is successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1286132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

For the past two years, Judith has been working hard to manage her knitting business, selling hand-made clothes such as sweaters. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Judith has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more yarn that will be used for making sweaters, and will help Judith to generate greater profits and take good care of herself and her family members. Judith hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business and own a big shop in town that sells sweaters. \r\n\r\nJudith is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Cathy is 22 years old and lives in the town of Nyendo, in the Masaka region of Uganda. For the past two years, Cathy has been working hard to manage her small shop, which sells scrap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Cathy has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more scrap, which she will resell to manufacturing factories. The buyers will use the scrap to make new saucepans and plates. This loan will help Cathy to generate greater profits and take care of her family members by providing for all their basic needs. Cathy hopes that, in the future, she will be able to own a wholesale shop that sells food commodities. \r\n\r\nCathy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1285893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled

Nurila's children are already grown-ups and live by themselves. The eldest son actively helps her in her business. Nurila has been working with livestock breeding for a period of 37 years, after having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nurila's hard work, her farm has three cows, 12 sheep, 10 goats and four mares. The income from the business activities allows Nurila to cover the daily expenses of the family. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Nurila turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of two heifers and one mare. Nurila plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals.

school-aged children; almost all her children are adults and provided for, only 2 sons live with her and go to a lyceum school.  Bedeykan as a main source of income has been raising livestock since 1966, having started this business with 15,000 KGS.  Thanks to Bedeykan's hard work on her farm, today she has 3 cows and 8 horses.  In addition, she and her family work 5.99 hectares of land.  Her monthly income from the business is 5,000 KGS from farming and livestock.  In order to further grow her business Bedeykan turned to \"Bai-Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock.  The newly acquired livestock will help Bedeykan increase her profits, and after paying off her loan she will keep a cow as a net profit.  Bedeykan plans to invest the profits from the loan into further increasing her domestic livestock count in order to save money to remodel her home.

","en":"Kanybek is 43 years old, married, and has three children. Kanybek's wife works as a librarian at the local library. In 1993, in search of an income for the family, Kanybek started his business of livestock breeding. Thanks to Kanybek's persistence and perseverance, having started the business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS), the farm currently brings in around 10,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and meat products, and now counts two cows, 16 heads of goats, 6 heads of sheep and one stallion. The income from the business helped Kanybek to pay for the education of his eldest children. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further increase the number of cattle, Kanybek turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 68,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cattle. He plans to save up the income from further increasing the number of household

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Zippy replied that it will bring increased income from poultry sales.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Zipporah owns the following: 'cow, poultry, and automobile' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, or motorcycle'.

Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1285970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Together they have collaborated on two previous loans from Friendship Bridge and have bolstered their small businesses. This group represents a variety of industries: a knitting business, a local clothing store, a convenience store, and a local sewing business. With their previous loans, one member was able to double her sewing capacity by purchasing two more sewing machines and by hiring another employee. \r\n\r\nWith this new loan Do\u00f1a Teresa (in the back row, second from the right), will be able to purchase necessary yarn and needles for her hand-knit sweater business. Having learned to knit as a child, Dona Teresa now has a life-time of experience and is able to help support her seven children. With school fees and the pressures of daily life in Guatemala, Teresa says that she has finally been able to \u201ccatch her breath\u201d after receiving her first two loans. She feels that \u201cthere is a peace that comes from knowing where your money is going to come from.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlong with Teresa, Las Florecitas de San Cristobal are excited to support their families, help pay for their children\u2019s education, and even help one member finish building her house.

This group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, Dominican Republic, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her longtime partner and three children. \r\n\r\nYusleny has been selling miscellaneous products for around six years. She started out with a small sum her partner gave her. She says that her most difficult challenges are selling her products on credit and then collecting on the credit extended.

She is married to Walden, a driver and a mother to their child. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJoy operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling items individually. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 12,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nJoy hopes her variety store will go a long way and dreams to give her child a good education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1286244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known for their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She previously accessed a 50,000 PHP loan that she used to buy RTW products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and in their personal, house hold and business expenditures. She has had this business for five years and it continues to grow.  She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their family.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan to buy different products like bed sheets, curtains and other items. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs and educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nCharlene hopes her business will keep on growing and dreams that her children will finish their studies.

She is married and has four children. Syrga is doing animal husbandry with her family. She started this business over 20 years ago by using her savings to buy one lamb and was able to build a well growing business. The profit from the business helps Syrga to cover her daily family expenses. With the goal to further grow her business Syrga has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle for feeding. Syrga plans to use the profit from the loan to further increase the headcount of livestock and in the future to help her children get settled.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1285003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tosh village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-01-30T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-01T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Syrga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:34:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50145.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743709},{"amount":1050,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50145.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777001}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T18:12:46Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:18:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":522833,"name":"Jessie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jessie is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a retailing business in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 9000 through NWTF to buy additional vegetables to sell at her retailing business.\r\n\r\nJessie has been in this business for 10 years.

She previously accessed a 25,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase additional stocks of supplies and products for her grocery store. Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and also in their personal, house hold and business expenditures. She has this business for just a year but her business is continuously growing. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses. She also has electronic loading for additional income.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 40,000 PHP loan for her to buy large amounts of grocery items. The more items displayed at the store the better. The more items she has to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nLovella hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future and high quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1177194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for large amount of grocery items needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-01-30T10:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-01T10:30:24Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lovella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2732.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484748},{"amount":266.66,"local_amount":10666,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10927.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037263},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":10667.03,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10928.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781781},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":10666.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10928.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488671},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5333,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5463.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894306}],"funded_date":"2013-01-30T15:29:19Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:36:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C Pettersen"}},{"id":522834,"name":"03-04-073-Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Dung works in agriculture, farming poultry and cattle.

He has four children and has been a farmer for 16 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops and other personal business activities.\r\n\r\nEvans says that the most enjoyable thing about farming is feeding and milking his dairy cows, while his biggest challenge is the diseases they can catch. He has given the animals on the farm the name \"Mrembo\". He will use the loan of 52,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) from Juhudi kilimo to buy and insure another dairy cow.\r\n\r\nEvans chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because the agency gives loans to small scale farmers like him. He learnt about their loans through Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. The agency offers reasonable loan terms that can run up to two years.\r\n\r\nWhen asked how this loan benefit his family, Evans replied 'I will be able to feed my family and take the children to school.' His highest monthly expense is school fees.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated and changes in living standards based on loans are measured. Evans owns cows and poultry but does not own pigs, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle or an automobile. His household has mosquito nets but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, a TV or a DVD player.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1286333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Jackson replied, \"My children will get a proper education and food.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jackson owns a cow and poultry but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

Her biggest challenge is 'Diseases.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Bahati and Lelmet\". She will channel the loan of 41,600 acquired from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nRose was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Because they give loans to farmers and I am a farmer who needs some finances.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'They are short term loans.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Rose replied 'I will be able to generate income from the sale of milk to support my family and educate my children.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Rose owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

There he has a store where he sells snack foods and soft drinks, so he is able to take advantage of the flow of customers who make purchases each day.  He relies on this income.  Leonardo\u2019s business experience started three years ago.  He was recommended by workers at a major company that was in need of everyday household products.  However, it was not easy to transport products from the market plaza.  At that moment, Leonardo was offered a location where he could set up his shop.  Now he is well-known in his neighborhood and in the surrounding areas.  His customers know that he keeps his store organized.  \r\n<p>\r\nLeonardo begins his work at 5 A.M. and continues until 5 P.M.  His sales are conducted with cash or through a payment system in which he offers a company discount based on the worker\u2019s salary.  The customer must agree to the arrangement.  Leonardo\u2019s goal is to update his inventory so that he will have a diversified assortment of products by which he can always influence his customers.  For this reason, he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Leonardo will use the money to buy rice, sugar, oil, and general household products.  He will also buy personal hygiene products and school supplies.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis investment will be successful because he will take advantage of this time to make adjustments to his inventory in response to market demand.

He has a workshop here, where he services, sells, and repairs electronics such as televisions, radios, and DVDs, and which he promotes on local billboards. His business is open from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. His customers are mostly neighbors and friends, who come to him because they know what he offers and the quality of his service.  \r\n\r\nJuan has received five loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he has managed to improve his business and increase his profits.

Ella ha recibido 1 cr\u00e9dito de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual ha logrado invertir y genera utilidades con lo que ha comprado todo lo necesario para vivir un poco mejor y para llevar a sus hijos una educaci\u00f3n con la que a futuro puedan salir adelante. Su meta mas adelante es tener una tienda donde vender ranchos, v\u00edveres, c\u00e1rnicos y todo lo que la clientela necesita para el consumo diario en sus hogares y que pueden comprar solo en peque\u00f1as cantidades. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 pl\u00e1tanos en mayor volumen, y gallinas, productos en los que adquiere precios muy competitivos e igualmente traslada a sus consumidores, por eso a ella la prefieren y esto es justamente lo que hace que su credikiva sea exitoso, pues su experiencia en el mercado convoca muchos compradores, que   traen a su negocio utilidades, con los que continua apoyando el bienestar de su familia y esto la hace muy feliz..\n\n","en":"Selling plantains, yucca, yams and hens has become an important and healthy way for Carmen to make her living ever since she arrived displaced with her family, made up of seven small children and her partner, with few income possibilities. Initially, she realized that in the neighborhood where she lived it was difficult to get tubers and hens. That is why she went to buy them at the nearest farms and sell them to clients that needed an easier way to meet their consumption of these basic family staples. She has received a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she has managed to invest and generate profits. With them, she has bought everything necessary to live a little bit better and to provide her children with an education with which they will be able to get ahead in the future. Her goal in the future is to have a store where she sells snacks, basic provisions and meat products and everything that customers need for everyday consumption in their homes and that they can only buy in small quantities. Currently, she is applying for a Kivaloan, with which she will buy plantains in greater volume and hens, products that she acquires at very competitive prices that she passes on to her consumers, which is why they prefer her, and is exactly what makes her Kivaloan successful. Her experience in the market brings her a lot of buyers that make her business profitable and with which she continues supporting the wellbeing of her family. This makes her very happy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1286699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy plantains in greater volumn, and hens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-01-30T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-01T17:50:05Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83324},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":82546},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84472},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86443},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88460},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90524},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92636},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91595}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.61,"local_amount":83324,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":84646.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071747},{"amount":47.17,"local_amount":82546,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83855.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497978},{"amount":47.94,"local_amount":83887,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":85218.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928538},{"amount":49.73,"local_amount":87028,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88408.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705690},{"amount":50.55,"local_amount":88460,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":89863.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967980},{"amount":151.05,"local_amount":274755,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-28T09:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":279114.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.95,"payment_id":450415528}],"funded_date":"2013-02-05T19:43:07Z","paid_date":"2014-02-28T09:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacqueline Demeranville","image":1016015}},{"id":522933,"name":"Samson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samson is a resident of Mariakani, Kenya.

Therefore, Elizabeth is requesting a loan in the amount of 10,000 PHP to buy grocery items such as canned goods, noodles, assorted bread, vegetable oil, and condiments to sell. Elizabeth believes that due to her patience in managing her business her income will increase.
