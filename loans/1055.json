But due to hard work and patience, she is able to have another business, which is sewing of curtains within her local community.

With her determination and aim to succeed, she is asking for additional capital of PHP8,000.

However, she aims for the continuous improvement of her business. In order to realise her goals, she is asking for a loan of 20,000 PHP. This will allow her to buy some grocery items such as soft drinks, canned goods, instant noodles, vegetables and raw meat. She knows that through a more complete stock of the grocery items that she offers, she would be able to satisfy her costumers' demand and gain better income for her family's future.

He says that he is 48 years old, and lives with his partner Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles. Together they have formed a family of three daughters who are studying. This time, Rogelio is requesting a personal loan to invest in his business. He mentions that they urge him to buy more cleaning products like bleach, fabric softener, floor cleaner, shampoo, and pine oil. He always buys these products in large quantities to later go to communities in his van promoting his products. When he sells his cleaning products, he sells them bulk bottles of what the housewives or housekeepers ask for and the quantities that they want. He has been in this business for 15 years. He says that he started because his mother-in-law sold cleaning products and, since he decided to live with \u00c1ngeles, he decided to sell these products. He says that it is going very well for him and he already has secure customers. Rogelio comments \u201cI always try to get the best products from my suppliers to always keep my customers satisfied with the products.\u201d He says that he has always had competition, and in fact, one of his bad experiences was when a male storeowner complained because he did not want him to sell on that street any longer since it seemed that the storeowner was not making the same sales anymore and asked him to no longer sell on that street. Rogelio never went back to sell on that street. However, people sought him out on another street to buy the products from him. Rogelio is very happy with Vision Fund and Kiva for the loan provided, since thanks to this, he will be able to obtain more products and his profits will increase, which will help him meet the costs of education for his daughters, since the most important thing for Rogelio is that his daughters finish professional degrees.

Together they have five children, all of whom are currently in education.\r\n\r\nNoelia has been baking bread for a living since she was 18, as her husband Delfino is also employed in this trade. It seems that the business was originally started by Delfino's father.\r\n\r\nThey are requesting this loan to buy ingredients for making bread like flour, eggs and milk, etc. The four members claim that, in general, the greatest difficulty that they face is when they go to markets to sell their goods and find that there is no place for them or that it is too expensive. Noelia comments \"I really enjoy making bread, as it is a family tradition and we do not want to lose the breads that we make. Ours are orange, walnut and vanilla, although we also make cream gorditas.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the difficulties that Noelia faces, her goal is to provide her children with a better future, so that they can finish their education, and to make some repairs to their home.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are Aurelio, Joel and Delfino who are also requesting loans from the institution to buy ingredients for making bread.

She only studied at elementary school level. She is married to Jose, who does farm work, and she has two children. She told us that when she was studying, there was only an elementary school in her community and in order to continue studying she would have had to go to another town and it would have been expensive. Since she was young she was taught how to work hard; the boys were taught how to farm and the girls were taught how to work in the home. Now times have changed and she and her husband both work to give to their children more opportunity to study. \r\n\r\nA little over three years ago Gabriela started to sell corn, tortillas and tortilla dough with the idea of earning income to help her husband with the household expenses. With the passing of time she has made good customers and her profits have increased which has allowed her to give her children a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nShe runs her business out of her home and because she is well known, her customers are happy to spend their money with her. This loan she will use to buy corn and firewood to be able to continue with her business. \r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to open a new business, perhaps selling groceries or clothing.\r\n\r\nThe communal bank group \"Dania\" is thankful for the support that has been given to them through loans for their businesses, which also help them give their families a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\nGregoria who sells drinks\r\nMirna who sells fruits and vegetables\r\nAraceli who sells household items  \r\nLiliana sells cheese\r\nYanet sells tortillas \r\nValentina sells drinks and candies\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1286214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn and firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Limas, Tezonapa;

He says to his financial backers: \"Thank you very much for the help.  It's a good job that helps the most needy people.\"\r\n\r\nCurrently Javier's requesting a Kiva loan to buy a computer, more supplies for his food, and corn to make dough.  The Carnival celebrations are approaching and the community of people who buy food usually grows during this period, which will make his Kiva loan successful.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1285941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

trabajando con la instituci\u00f3n platica que tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad es un hombre casado desde hace a\u00f1os con la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda del Carmen juntos han formado una familia con cinco hijos de los cuales tres de ellos aun son dependientes que se encuentran estudiando, Don Andr\u00e9s solo estudio la secundaria y tiene una rosticer\u00eda desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, Platica que inicio su negocio porque anteriormente era carpintero en la ciudad solo que muchas veces no hay trabajo y ten\u00eda que descansar varios periodos de tiempo, fue como decidi\u00f3 emprender su rosticer\u00eda, solo que al inicio se le dificulto mucho ya que nadie le ofrec\u00eda apoyo para iniciar su rosticer\u00eda, pr\u00e1cticamente don Andr\u00e9s no ten\u00eda conocimiento de nada ni siquiera para preparar el pollo platica que sus pollos al principio les faltaba cocinar (Crudos),se le quemaba para poder aprender tuvieron que pasar tres meses, entre otras situaciones que tuvo que vivir quiz\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n influ\u00eda en la maquina porque inicio con una maquina usada, esta vez Don Andr\u00e9s est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comprar otra m\u00e1quina porque piensa abrir otra rosticer\u00eda en otro municipio,  platica de las dificultades por las cuales ha presentado que fue fueron sus dos accidentes el primero fue debido a la carga de trabajo como consecuencia se quedo dormido en el volante porque se encontraba conduciendo de noche  las consecuencias no afectaron mucho al negocio, tampoco a su familia sin embargo si hubo consecuencias en su salud y gasto mucho en medicamentos, en este accidente perdi\u00f3 la camioneta que apenas hab\u00eda comprado y tuvo que recurrir  a una camioneta mas viejita con la que inicio claro que a esta le cab\u00edan menos pollos Don Andr\u00e9s acostumbra traer el pollo en otro municipio que queda como una hora de camino. En su otro accidente su hubo grandes p\u00e9rdidas porque en este si tuvo que cerrar una poller\u00eda que ten\u00eda en otro municipio, en este \u00faltimo accidente aunque no tuvo la culpa tuvo que pagar todo lo ocasionado las p\u00e9rdidas materiales del otro carro. Sin embargo a pesar de todo esto Don Andr\u00e9s tiene la meta de que sus hijos tengan que un patrimonio que les permita vivir planamente, pero tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda que sus negocios le den lo suficiente para pode asegurar su vejez no le gustar\u00eda vivir con preocupaciones econ\u00f3micas.\n\n","en":"Andr\u00e9s is a very hardworking and responsible man and this is the first time that he will be working with the institution. He tells us that he is 43 and has been married to Mar\u00eda del Carmen for several years, together they have 5 children and 3 of them are dependent on them and still in education.\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s only obtained a secondary school education and has had a rotisserie for four years. He says he started his business because he used to be a carpenter and often found himself without work for periods of time. He decided to start his business, which was difficult to begin with as no-one offered him any support. Andr\u00e9s had practically no knowledge of how to run his business, not even how to prepare the chickens. He tells us that in the beginning his chickens were raw and needed cooking, he often burned them and it took three months for him to learn. Along with the some of other experiences he has had, this may have been partly caused by the machine, as he began his business with a second-hand machine. \r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s is requesting the loan to buy another machine as he is thinking about opening another rotisserie in another town. He tells us that the difficulties he has faced include his two accidents, the first of which happened because of his workload as he fell asleep at the wheel whilst driving at night, although the consequences have not affected his business nor his family, although his health has been affected and he has to spend a lot on medicines. In the accident he lost the van that he had only just bought and had to go back to an older van, which obviously could not hold as many chickens.\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s is used to taking the chicken to another town and spends around an hour en route. In his other accident, he experienced greater losses as he had to close a chicken shop in another town. Although this accident was not his fault, he was forced to pay for the lost materials from the other vehicle.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite all of this, Andr\u00e9s has a goal for his children to have a legacy so that they can live fully, but he would also like his businesses to do well enough to provide for him in his old age as he would not like to live with financial concerns."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1283815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy machinery for a new rotisserie.

They live in a housing development that is supported by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which supports the construction of sustainable communities. Candelaria was given a place to live in this community by the Colombian government because she was displaced from the home she was living in. Before she was given her home she had many needs, so when she became a beneficiary of this project, she didn't hesitate to sell all of her household furnishings and with the profits opened a small store with basic food necessities for a family. Little by little her small store has turned into an income generator, which she is now able to support her family with. Her goal is to be able to provide her children with a good education so that they will have a better future. This is why she works persistently to achieve her goal.     \r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for her first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which is a Kiva loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries for her business and increase her capital. Her kiva loan project will be successful because it will increase her ability to buy in large quantities, and by doing so obtain special discounts and sell much more than the is usually able to sell when working only with her own capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1286759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries to restock her store.

Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources she wasn't able to go to college, but she would have liked to have studied to become a clinical lab technician.\r\nThanks to her enterprising spirit and her drive to get ahead, she owns a business which is a grocery store. She has been in this line of work for the past 8 years and the store is located in one of the local children's hospitals. She greatly enjoys running this business, since it has been a means of livelihood for her and her children.

Angela sells shows, Maria de los Angeles sells drinks, Maria Luisa sells cosmetics, Karla sells shoes, Margarita sells drinks and Irma sells groceries.\r\n\r\nMargarita is a happy and enterprising woman who has two children, she only studied a primary school education and is married to Roberto. She tells us that she always wanted to have a grocery shop in her home to be able to help with the household expenses. Five months ago, with the help of her husband, she was able to set up a little shop where she sells various groceries, sweets and drinks. Margarita opens her business early every day to welcome her neighbours. Her favourite thing about her business is that her children are learning to work as they occasionally help in the store.\r\n\r\nA loan from Vision Fund will help her to restock her business by buying beans, oil, rice, soup, sugar, toilet paper, tin foil, tooth paste, shampoo, biscuits and drinks. She hopes that with this investment her business can continue growing and offering a better service to her customers and in the future she will be able to give her children the opportunity to continue with their studies.\r\n\r\nNB. the woman in the background wearing the blouse and black trousers is not a group member, but she wanted to be in the

Currently, they are carrying out large scale construction in the industrial areas and it is the location for one of the greatest town fairs, which at the moment encourages Edgar who sells fast food at a strategic spot where for three years he has managed to maintain good prices and stock with which he makes his offering each day.  Before starting his own business he was an administrator in a similar business in the city of Barranquilla.  Little by little he raised money and had the opportunity to take advantage of his experience and begin his own generator of income.  Today, he is known in the town of Galapa for delicious hotdogs, hamburgers, pizza, and salchipapas (a kind of kebab) that he makes with the best sauces, which he prepares himself.  \r\n\r\nToday he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will increase the size of his purchases of supplies like bread, tomato sauce, mayonnaise, and mustard, getting him better discounts at a time when sales increase in response to the carnivals.  This is what makes sure the investment will be opportune and very successful.  His larger goal is to buy a restaurant space and acquire a new position that will generate new income and greater reputation in the plaza."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1286763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies like bread, tomato sauce, mayonnaise, and mustard.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-01-30T21:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-01T21:50:06Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100426},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112102},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114718},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117395},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120134},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122937},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125806},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128741},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131745},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134819},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137965},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153212}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.91,"local_amount":100426,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":101323.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497958},{"amount":128.53,"local_amount":226820,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":228846.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527772},{"amount":66.52,"local_amount":117395,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":118443.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705669},{"amount":137.74,"local_amount":243071,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":245242.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967961},{"amount":71.29,"local_amount":125806,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":126929.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323435},{"amount":72.96,"local_amount":128741,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":129890.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082678},{"amount":151.05,"local_amount":266564,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":268945.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062065},{"amount":165,"local_amount":291177,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":293777.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731762}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T15:19:49Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":522935,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce  sells cement at Ankyeryim near Takoradi which she has done for 20 years.

buen negocio por lo que decidio iniciar ella independientemente, cuenta que le ha ido muy bien en sus ventas siempre trata lo mejor posible a su clientas, platica que lo mas chistoso de su trabajo es venderle ropa intima a los cabaleros ya que ellos es mas dificil de tenerlos contentos porque a unos no les gusta la tela, los colores, los estilos, tipos y a otros pues si es muy dificil convencer a los caballeros que le compren por eso casi no venden ropa intima para caballero, Maura comento \"Me gusta mucho mi actividad porque gracias a la venta de ropa intima he podido sacar adelante a mis hijos que se encuentran estudiando ya que para mi ellos son mi pilares para seguir adelante, aunque luego hay clientes que se tardan en pagar pero siempre pagan tarde pero seguro\" Do\u00f1a Maura anteriormente solo vendia por catalogo pero penso que obtendria mas gannacias si pudiera vender varios tipos de ropa y atraer mas clientas situacion que le ha favorecido muy bien todas las tardes Do\u00f1a Maura recorre las calles de su comunidad y de otras comunidades para ofrecer sus prendas, una de las metas de Do\u00f1a Maura es que sus hijos puedan realizarse profesionalmente para que

It is a very friendly group that knows how to solve problems easily between themselves. They have a strong friendship which makes them different from other groups. They chose the name for the group themselves because they liked it; they\u2019re not sure if the fact that one of the members is called Jazmin influenced them or if it was something else. \r\n\r\nMaura is a member of the group and is 38 years old. She is the single mother of three children who are all in school. Maura sells underwear and is requesting a loan so that she can buy items such as bras, panties, tights, among other items. She has been running her business for five years and started the business  because she was helping a  friend with her underwear business and saw that it made money. That\u2019s why she decided to set up a business of her own. She has made good sales and she always tries to treat her customers well. She says that the funniest thing about her job is selling underwear to men because they are very difficult to please. They either don\u2019t like the material, the color, or the styles, and it\u2019s very difficult to convince them to buy things, and that\u2019s why she hardly ever sells to men. Maura says, \"I like my job a lot because thanks to selling underwear, I have been able to provide for my children who are in school and for me they are my motivation to keep going. Some customers take a while to pay me but they always pay in the end.\" Maura used to sell by catalog but realized that she could make more money selling a variety of clothing to attract more customers, which has worked well for her. \r\n\r\nEvery afternoon Maura passes through the streets of her community and other communities selling clothing. One of Maura\u2019s goals is for her children to be able to achieve their professional dreams so that they have a better quality of life. The other members of the group are Florentina, who will buy corn to make tortillas, Margarita who will invest in her dressmaking workshop, Maribel, Beatriz,  and Miran will invest in clothes to sell, Alicia will buy materials to improve her house, Lizbeth C, Jazmin, Laura and Antonia will buy chickens and turkeys to raise and sell, Elena, Lizbeth S. and Rosalia will invest in sheep to raise and sell, finally Leticia will buy fabric to make curtains to sell.\r\nThey are all very grateful to Vision Found and Kiva for the loan which will be a great help for their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6300,"image":{"id":1283145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Meltus joined One Acre Fund in order to improve his farming techniques with One Acre Fund methods and access the best input prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeltus reports that before One Acre Fund, he was able to grow about 4 bags of maize per \u00bd acre, but with his One Acre Fund input loan during Long Rains 2012, he harvested 9.5 bags per 1\/2 acre! He hopes that his profits from the 2013 Long Rains season can be used to send his children to school and perhaps invest in another business. During the 2013 Long Rains season, each group member will receive \u00bd an acre of agricultural inputs on credit. Meltus\u2018 group will receive 5 acres worth of inputs on credit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1285049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bungoma South","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-01-30T22:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-01T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meltus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nikola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Share","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":55000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56970.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602585}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T20:25:39Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:21:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":522985,"name":"010327B\u1eafc S\u01a1n - Ho\u1eb1ng Ph\u1ee5 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. \u0110\u1ecbnh  operates a food stall\/restaurant selling\u00a0fish sauce.

His younger daughter sells clothes and goods imported from China to local people.\r\n\r\n Since 2006, he has been building his own house, and 90 percent of the construction work is now completed. Due to finances, he hasn\u2019t finished the interior work, and now wants to finish it as soon as possible. So, he is requesting a loan of 6500000 MNT to purchase construction and insulation materials such as cement, gypsum and glass cotton. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the family will be able to live in a comfortable and warm place due to an insulated and completed house. More importantly, the house will reduce coal usage drastically, which will contribute greatly to the environmental protection cause.

A Navy veteran and former realtor, he worked his way into the construction industry after receiving numerous home repair and \u201cfix-up\u201d requests during his eight years as a realtor.\n\nKnowing the majority of requests would be unpaid, he considered a career change and opened One Stop Contractors in his hometown of El Paso. He now employs two to seven people per project.\n\nOne Stop Contractors is a general contracting business that does \u201ca little bit of everything,\u201d Andres says. His list of services includes remodeling, painting, and floor repairing. The multiple services offered within the three-year-old business make it unique among others in the El Paso area, Andres says, as his business is not tied to one field of construction. In fact, that ability to work within many general aspects of construction is what inspired him to name his company \u201cOne Stop.\u201d\n\nAndres applied for a loan from Accion Texas Inc. after another Accion client (and military veteran) referred him to the nonprofit lender. \n\nWith a pending contract to resurface the outside, change some siding, and paint all three of a seafood restaurant chain in El Paso, Andres says he wouldn\u2019t have been able to close the deal without upfront funds and equipment to complete the project. \n\nThe restaurant is offering Andres and his team a total of $30,000 for their work. Andres hopes the loan will help rebuild credit for the business and gain positive cash flow for future projects. \u201cThis loan is going to take me a step forward,\u201d he says proudly.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6544.06,"image":{"id":1279435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"31-year-old Clara lives in the town of Cartagena de Indias with her husband and her little 10-year-old son. She makes shoes and also makes cleaning products. She started these businesses by taking a course at the National Training Service (SENA), where she learned the technical skills. After taking her lessons, she decided to put them into practice in order to get an income of her own. Her dream is to own a large store where she can sell all the products she makes. However, her biggest challenge is having enough working capital to accomplish this purpose. That's the reason why she requests a Kiva loan, which she plans to use to begin increasing production so that she can improve her sales.

Vitali is requesting a loan under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

After the tax is paid, Vitali will collaborate with construction companies and work privately as well so that he can earn additional income.

The family is relatively new to cacao, and currently manages six acres with around 600 productive and 300 newly planted cacao trees. Lucio says cacao farming was inspired by Leticia, who favored cacao because it is perennial as opposed to the most typical Belizean crop package of beans and corn. \n\nThe family is excited about cacao, especially because their trees started producing with just under three years from transplantation. It usually takes five years for ungrafted trees to produce cacao pods. So-called side-grafting is the process of implanting a shoot from a mature tree into a younger one, and results in more productive trees that also take less time to start yielding pods. Lucio says his favorite part of cacao farming is picking out the perfect ripe pods for harvesting. \u201cIt is my favorite job, I\u2019m not out to work somewhere in some company, I work on my farm,\u201d says Lucio, however adding that sometimes it feels like too much work. \n\nLucio and Leticia are requesting this loan to clean and prune productive cacao trees and plant banana in between newly transplanted seedlings to provide necessary shade. Cleaning is the process of clearing underbrush to clear access to trees, and is a process that needs to be repeated three to four times annually in cacao farms in the lush tropical lowlands of Belize. Pruning means cutting excess branches on trees to keep them from growing too tall and unwieldy and to increase yields in the coming season. Shade is a requisite ingredient in cacao farming, what makes this practice especially environmentally friendly since cutting forest is not only unnecessary but also detrimental to growing cacao.\n\nLeticia and Lucio are focused on their daughter\u2019s education, and hope that she will also be of help around the farm. Lucio says he plans to work hard in the coming years to bring up production so the family could invest in building a nice house. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1286814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To clean and prune six acres of cacao.

Four of the children are still in school, and help out around the farm when not busy with homework. \n\nSimeon was introduced to cacao farming by the local co-operative around seven years ago, and has been growing his farm and yields ever since. Cacao is good, but takes too long to start producing, says Simeon. Cacao trees are a long-term investment for farmers, as they typically start producing between three to five years of transplanting them into the ground. For Simeon, the most common challenges are rodents like quash \u2013 also known as coatimundi \u2013 and squirrels, as well as the woodpecker, who do everything to get to ripe pods before the farmers themselves. \n\nBesides cacao, the family grows orange and the traditional Mayan package of corn, beans and rice. They hope to provide the children with an education, to give them options. \u201cFarming is very hard, but if you have an education, you could get easier jobs, working in buildings,\u201d Simeon told Maya Mountain Cacao, adding that a good education is never wasted on anyone. \n\nThe family is requesting the loan to hire 16 people for one workday to help with cleaning two acres of cacao.

The children are all grown up, with the youngest aged 15, and the oldest 35. All children but the youngest, who\u2019s currently in school, live and work Belize City, the former capital of the country. Because of a recent upsurge in urban violence, Ancelmo says he\u2019d prefer the kids came back to work the land instead.\n\nAncelmo is one of the more experienced cacao farmers in the area, having started as long as 15 years ago. That period marked the first push for cacao planting in Belize with the arrival of the multinational Hershey\u2019s Chocolate. A further expansion in the ranks of cacao farming was the establishment of a local co-op that besides seeds, also provided farmers with stable market access. \n\nFor Ancelmo, the favorite part of cacao farming is harvesting and not finding diseased or bird-eaten pods. \u201cWhen I reach and see the pods yellow, I\u2019m not happy,\u201d he tells Maya Mountain Cacao. The challenging part is pruning, because the trees get tall and hard to reach. Ancelmo says sometimes he has to do it with a ladder, and that takes a long time because it\u2019s slippery and dangerous if you try to rush. When farmers have time to do regular pruning, it keeps the trees from getting too tall and unwieldy, and also makes them more productive in the coming season. \n\nIn the near future, the family hopes to expand their cacao fields by planting 1,000 trees. Once they are productive, they hope to invest in home improvement. The current loan will be used for cleaning and pruning around 450 cacao trees, and will require and create the equivalent of 20 days of labor in the community. Ancelmo also plans to rehabilitate an additional 2 acre plot he hasn\u2019t been managing because of time constraints and hard to work, hilly terrain. Rehabilitation here refers to cleaning and pruning the trees that are still standing and planting new ones in place of withered ones. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1286843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"Clean, prune one acre of cacao and rehabilitate two acres of older cacao trees.

There\u2019s land to work,\u201d says Santiago, pointing out that in his native Guatemala land is hard to come by. Besides cacao, the family grows beans, corn, coffee, cardamom, avocado and anatto. Annatto is a high bush that is used for making achiote, also known as recado \u2013 a reddish paste that is often used for spicing up tamales.  \n\nSantiago started planting cacao just five years ago, after seeing a fellow villager with cacao seedlings and giving a try to the crop himself. \u201cCacao is very pretty,\u201d says Santiago, adding that it\u2019s of great use in the home too, as the hot chocolate drink makes for a tasty alternative to coffee. The Mayan chocolate drink is made by grinding dried, unfermented cacao beans and grinding them \u2013 usually by hand \u2013 into a paste that is then dissolved in water. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to transplant 400 seedlings from the on-site nursery as well as cleaning and pruning around 600 cacao trees. Transplanting is the process of planting into the ground seedlings that have been raised in bags for at least six months. The work will require hiring four people for two days of work, while Santiago plans to do the clearing work himself over a longer period of time. \n\nSantiago is currently saving up money to get his land surveyed so the family could get an official title to the land they are working. Private ownership already exists in Red Bank, however to claim it farmers need to hire surveyors. An alternative to privately owned land is a communal land system that is still commonplace in many Mayan villages throughout Belize. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1286847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To clean and prune cacao fields and transplant new seedlings.

They raised seven children, aged between 17 and 32, all of who have jobs and live outside of the village communities. Two of the youngest are currently studying in the University of Belize, and all others have already completed schooling. \n \n\u201cI did hard work to send every single one to school,\u201d says Placido. The couple works the farm together - Florentina helps with tasks like setting up nurseries, filling the bags with seeds and harvesting, as do the kids when they\u2019re around. Cleaning, however, is something Placido either has to do himself or hire outside help.  Cacao is a good crop, he assures, because it\u2019s permanent: \u201crain or shine, it\u2019s there,\u201d he says. A cacao farmer of five years and counting, Placido got into the business by recommendation: \u201cI always listen to good advice,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao. He started by buying bags and cacao fruit for seeds that he himself planted into bags instead of starting from pre-raised seedlings. \u201cMost people told me I can\u2019t do it, because that\u2019s not how it\u2019s done,\u201d he said, confessing that he himself was relieved and very happy once his cacao started bearing fruit.  \n\nFor Placido, the best part of farming is his routinely check on the farm, when he visits the nursery and trees to check on progress. The hardest is cleaning the bush, he says, adding that it\u2019s especially tricky when you have freshly planted cacao, which you can accidentally chop together with the surrounding underbrush. Besides farming, Placido has a side cattle business and runs a little grocery store in Pueblo Viejo. In the future, if health allows, he hopes to expand what he already started \u2013 the cacao farm, cattle, improve his shop and continue working on his house to better accommodate the regularly visiting kids. The family hopes they\u2019ve set a good example for their children, who can each accomplish more than their parents because of the added benefit of education. \u201cI can do little. They\u2019re going to school and getting valuable experience, so they can do more,\u201d he says. \n\nFlorentina and Placido are requesting this loan to hire help to clean around 500 newly planted trees over two acres of tropical lowlands. Cleaning means clearing the underbrush to open access to cacao trees, which grow literally in the middle of the jungle. Farmers typically clean three to four times a year to keep their trees accessible. The job at hand will require hiring four people to clear the underbrush for 2 weeks. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1286859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"Clean 2 acres of recently transplanted cacao trees.

of Pueblo Viejo. The kids are aged five to 13, and three are currently in school. Besides farming, Bernarda and Fileon make crafts to sell in town \u2013 hand-carved calabash ornaments and lamp shades among other decorative items.\n\nFileon got the idea to plant cacao eight years ago after meeting a chocolate maker while selling his crafts in town and subsequently requesting bags to raise cacao seeds from the local co-op. He then proceeded to clear some bush to make room for the cacao under the canopy of native trees and has been caring for it ever since. Besides the access to market for one of very few viable cash crops in Belize, the family likes cacao for use at the home. \u201cI like it, because I roast some and then drink it instead of coffee,\u201d says Fileon, adding that store-bought coffee is probably not good for you, while cacao keeps him healthy and working hard. For Fileon, the best part of cacao farming is seeing the trees clean and nicely pruned. The most challenging is that cacao grows naturally in an environment shared with animals, who enjoy chewing on the roots \u2013 like peccaries, and the fruit \u2013 like squirrels and birds, says Fileon. \n\nThe family is happy to be able to send their kids to school, which in Belize comes with tuition for each child in any level of public education. Fileon says he hopes the kids end up going to university, as it was something he would have wanted, but didn\u2019t get the opportunity to do himself. \u201cNow they have options, they can work the farm or get other jobs too,\u201d Fileon told Maya Mountain Cacao. In the future, Fileon wants to start working on a house of a more appropriate size for his large family and to keep busy with the crafts and farm. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to clean and prune around 1,500 productive cacao trees and set up a nursery for 500 new plants. Cleaning is done by using a machete to clean underbrush that continually grows around cacao trees, in order to make them accessible for pruning and harvest. Pruning is the process of cutting excess branches from trees to keep them from intertwining with one another and producing at their highest capacity.

Her monthly profits total roughly 8,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue growing her business, Shaarkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase cows and thereby increase her income from milk sales.

secundaria, es soltero y gracias al esp\u00edritu emprendedor que hered\u00f3,  se ha forjado camino para salir adelante por su familia; su hijo y su pareja con quienes vive en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Su comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\n\u00c1ngel aprendi\u00f3 de su padre la labor de realizar acabados de construcci\u00f3n en las viviendas urbanas y rurales de la Provincia. Con esfuerzo y mucha incertidumbre inici\u00f3 este negocio hace 3 a\u00f1os, con el sue\u00f1o de un d\u00eda poder brindar a su familia una vida de calidad y excelencia. Su trabajo se alterna entre dise\u00f1o de alacenas para cocinas, instalaci\u00f3n de baldosa, azulejo, duelas en los pisos, paredes, pintura, puertas, etc. Es muy importante para este trabajo identificar bien los gustos de los clientes y las preferencias que tienen para la decoraci\u00f3n de sus hogares. \u00c1ngel dedica a este trabajo 8 horas cada d\u00eda en las cuales puede permanecer en una sola vivienda o atender varias. En el transcurso del tiempo, este hombre sin duda luchador, ha visto la necesidad de incurrir en la compra de algunas herramientas que facilitar\u00e1n y agilitar\u00e1n su trabajo, para lo cual solicita un cr\u00e9dito que le ayudar\u00e1 en la compra de estas herramientas. El mayor obst\u00e1culo que \u00c1ngel ha tenido para fortalecer su negocio es la falta de capital por la dificultad de las instituciones financieras para otorgar cr\u00e9ditos a las personas de escasos recursos de las zonas rurales. Sin embargo, gracias a la recomendaci\u00f3n de un ejecutivo de cr\u00e9dito de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, ha encontrado el apoyo y asesor\u00eda que \u00e9l esperaba. \u00c1ngel da gracias a las personas alrededor del mundo que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva aportan para que \u00e9l obtenga el capital que desde hace tanto tiempo le ha hecho falta. ","en":"\u00c1ngel is 25 years old and only was able to finish high school through much effort.  He is single and, thanks to the entreprenurial spirit he inherited, has been able to provide for his family.  He lives with his partner and son in the parish of R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo which is the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas in Ecuador.  This province has shown considerable sustained growth over the last few years.  The capital is known for its delicious fruit and gastronomy, and has become the major commercial route between the sierra and coastal regions of the country.  Both local and foreign tourists visit the many tourist attractions and warm climate.  Most of the inhabitants are involved in some type of commercial or service business catering to the local population and tourists.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel learned his trade from his father.  He is a construction worker in urban and rural residential areas of the province.  He started his business three years ago, with much effort and uncertainty, in an effort to give his family a better quality of life.  He alternates his work with designing kitchens, installing tile and flooring, painting walls, doors, etc.  This job requires being able to identify a customer's preferences for home decoration.  \u00c1ngel works eight hours a day, either in a single house or among several.  Over time, this hard worker has observed a need to buy certain tools to help facilitate his work, so he is requesting a loan to buy these tools.  \u00c1ngel's greatest obstacle for strengthening his business has been the lack of capital.  This is due to the fact that lending institutions are not likely to give loans to low-income earners in rural areas.  However, thanks to the recommendation of a loan executive at Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, he has found the support and advice he hoped for.  \u00c1ngel is grateful to people around the world who, through Kiva, are giving him the capital he so badly needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1286633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To

","en":"Marlene, who owns a convenience store, obtained a Kiva loan to buy a display cabinet.  She did, indeed, buy one and, at the same time, she purchased foodstuffs to stock it.   In the process, she gave her shop a completely new image.  It is now better stocked, but has a faster turnover and her buffer stock is often insufficient to meet demand. This means that her purchases do not last long, but she feels happy because she sells everything.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nDezelyn hopes that her variety store will become a grocery store and dreams of giving a quality education to her children.

During this time of year, the price of construction materials generally reaches its lowest level. As a result, purchasing materials at this time will enable her to save money for the upcoming White Moon festival (a traditional Mongolian ceremony). Most importantly, the renovated house will have the benefit of not losing heat so easily, contributing to the efforts against air pollution by enabling the family to burn less coal.

She is married to Carlos, a driver, and she is a mother to her children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRebecca owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nRebecca dreams to have a happy family and hopes that her grandchildren will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known from their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She has 3 children with ages ranging from 7 to 12 years. She describes herself as a hardworking woman. She operates a retail store where she sells various items such as cooking fat, detergents, margarine, flour, sugar, rice, etc. Her business is located in a viable business area and her primary customers are local residents. She describes her biggest business challenge to be insufficient funds for improving the business. Everline also gets business income from her husband's grocery store which he operates.\r\n\r\nShe will use the Kes 21,000 loan to buy a water harvesting tank which will be used by her family members for household activities.

However, he loves his business and earns a good living from it. Two of Ahmad's sons have gone to Russia to find jobs and now send their parents some money whenever possible.\r\n\r\nLast year, there was a drought and Ahmad was forced to buy animal fodder at high prices. Now, he would like to buy several cows and thus increase the size of his herd. Despite his age, Ahmad runs his business on his own and personally takes his cattle to the market to sell it. He is unable to sit still, is always doing something, and is glad to be occupied with his favourite work. Ahmad is planning to use this loan to buy cattle and animal feed. He will fatten the animals and then sell them in the spring, when livestock prices go up. Ahmad thanks MDO Arvand for their financial support and help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1282820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahmad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4919.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5080.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1033.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1033.01,"local_amount":4919.08,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4927.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751917},{"amount":1066.99,"local_amount":5080.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5089.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390615990}],"funded_date":"2013-02-09T23:17:58Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":523529,"name":"Dimas Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dimas  de 39 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 4 hijos en las edades de 4 a 18 a\u00f1os en el suroccidente de la ciudad, donde tiene un negocio mediante el cual ofrece servicios de internet, llamadas a celulares y servicios de juegos electr\u00f3nicos, de lunes a domingos, desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 10 de la noche.

","en":"     A very capable young man named Ravshan is one of a small number of people that started a business in the field of baking at a young age. He is now 26 years old and when he was a child, he used to apprentice under the guidance of his uncle, who is a \"nonvoy\" (bread baker.) Every day, young Ravshan observed how his uncle mixed the dough, placed it into a circular baking pan and formed it in a tandoor oven. He watched with admiration how the dough deepened its colour in the tandoor as it baked into Tajikistani national flatbread. This is the reason for his interest in, and attachment to, the profession of baking.\r\n     Now Ravshan is a professional baker and has been working independently for 3 years. By making the most of his experience and acquired skills, he was able to open his own bakery. He can earn his living and feed his family in this way. He is married and has 3 children. At present, he rents his premises and employs one assistant. He wants to expand his business and buy more ingredients to bake flatbread. In the hopes of a bright future, he has decided to seek a loan so that his business does not plateau, and so he can ensure a stable income for his family. As Ravshan himself says, \"I hope that the loan I obtain will justify my hope that I can expand, and that my business will not reach a plateau.\"   \r\n     Ravshan plans to use this loan to purchase several bags of flour, yeast, and butter. He is really striving to make sure that his family does not want for anything, and he works day and night. He extends his gratitude to such organisations as Kiva for the financial support and understanding. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  .

He lives in the small village of Lagodekhi District with his wife and 3 sons. Akpar requested loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nAkpar trades seasonal fruits and vegetables. He buys a stock of fruits and vegetables from the wholesalers and then sells them locally at a higher price. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nAkpar requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. Jonny reside en la Parroquia Luz de Am\u00e9rica de este cant\u00f3n, un sector que es considerado como el port\u00f3n de entrada a la Provincia, por la riqueza de su tierra, ha sido el nido de varias empresas productoras de alimentos adem\u00e1s que es la zona de mayor producci\u00f3n de papaya, fruta ex\u00f3tica exportada desde aqu\u00ed. Es por esto que los habitantes de esta parroquia en su gran mayor\u00eda, se dedican a la agricultura y tambi\u00e9n a la ganader\u00eda lo cual ha sido la motivaci\u00f3n para que varios emprendedores de la zona fortalezcan esta actividad con su trabajo, experiencia y  esfuerzo.\nJonny es un hombre que desde ni\u00f1o aprendi\u00f3 con sus padres a criar animales de todo tipo, su ayuda era esencial para que sus padres cumplieran a cabalidad el trabajo que realizaban para tener el sustento diario en casa. Desde hace 2 a\u00f1os ejerce independientemente el trabajo de criar cerdos y patos para su posterior venta, Jonny est\u00e1 pendiente del alimento, salud, estad\u00eda de sus animales para que luego \u00e9stos se vendan en un buen precio en el mercado, estas tareas le llevan desde 8 horas cada d\u00eda en distintos horarios dependiendo de las necesidades de los animales y las condiciones del clima.

He completed his primary school education in a public school in the area and lives in Santo Domingo canton in the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo connects the mountainous and coastal regions of Ecuador. It is a city that has become a commercial hub with several growth sectors and as proof you have several enterprising families that began some years ago with small businesses which have now become small enterprises contributing to job growth. Studies reveal that a majority of the businesses began by trial ad error and that they have been well received by passing tourists, businessmen and travelers who move from one region to another. Moreover, Santo Domingo is the third most populous city in the country. \r\n\r\nJonny lives in Luz de Am\u00e9rica parish in this canton, an area considered the gateway to the province because of the richness of its soil. It has been the birthplace of several food companies as well as the area of greatest papaya production and exportation of exotic fruit. Consequently most of the inhabitants of the parish engage in agriculture and also livestock raising, a factor motivating several entrepreneurs in the area to strengthen these enterprises through their work, experience and effort.\r\n\r\nJonny is a man who, from the time he was a child, learned how to raise all kinds of animals from his parents. His help was essential so that his parents could meet their responsibilities of putting food on the table. For the past two years Jonny has been working independently raising pigs and ducks for later re-sale. He manages their feeding and health needs during their stay before selling them at market for a good price. These tasks take about 8 hours every day on different schedules depending on the needs of the animals and weather conditions.\r\n\r\nJonny has seen the need to expand and upgrade the sheds where his animals stay and has requested a loan for this purpose as well as to buy animal feed wholesale so that he can obtain the best price from his provider. Previously, Jonny has had difficulty obtaining loans from various financial institutions because he lives in a rural parish several kilometers from the city and this has made it difficult for the loan officers to make the long trip required to reach his house. Thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, this barrier has been overcome since they care about people in rural areas, and thanks to Kiva,  today Jonny is able to receive the help that he needs to grow as a small business man, a dream that many of you are a part of!!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1287390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She lives in the town of Cartagena de Indias, also known as \"la heroica\" (\"the heroic one\"), located in the northern coast of Colombia like a star in the Caribbean sea. It was in these charming and warm surroundings that she first started her sewing business 15 years ago, following her family's tradition of working mainly in dressmaking-related activities. Her main lines of work are women's dresses, blouses and pants, and also uniforms, which she usually makes when she gets contracts. She sells on credit of 7 days, all the while making her purchases by cash every 7 days as well. Her goal of gaining new customers is enduring, but the working capital that she has is not enough to accomplish this purpose. That's the reason why she requests a Kiva loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She'll use it to purchase fabric, thread, zippers and sewing supplies so that she can make new designs in accordance with the current demands.

For two years now she has been selling clothes.  She has exclusive designs, created with the help of two designers and she sends for her patterns to be made.  She buys her merchandise in a district known for its fabric shops, near to her home.  In addition, she sells perfumes, which she buys from distributors.\r\n\r\nShe works from home, going door to door and takes orders.  She says that she also worked as a home assessor in the Las Condes commune, which is far for her home.  She did this 15 years ago when she came to Chile (Am\u00e9rica is Peruvian).\r\n\r\nShe has used her loan to buy new fabrics for the season.\r\n\r\nAm\u00e9rica's dream is to have a shop in uptown Santiago, where she has seen that there is a better market and more demand.\r\n\r\nAm\u00e9rica is motivated to work away at her business so that she can give financial security to her children.  She lives with her three children and with a higher income she will be able to pay for their education.\r\n\r\nShe has liked working with Fondo Esperanza as they teach her to value her business and teach members to support each other.  She also likes the relationship with others, particularly as a foreigner.  She has been warmly welcomed into the group.\r\n\r\nIndependencia, in the north of the city, is one of the 34 communes that make up Chile's capital, Santiago.  It emerged at the end of the nineteenth century as a traditional area.  Its centre is Avenida Independencia, the road along which the ancient \"Camino del Inca\" (Inca path) ran.  This was the main entry from the north into the city of Santiago.  Given its large indigenous population, it is in Independencia that you find Chile's Indigenous Culture Centre.  The area also has various significant, historic buildings, including six of the country's monuments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7400,"image":{"id":1287381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She will save her profits to expand her business and to take care of her family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1287385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy cases of tomatoes and bags of peppers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6874},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7139},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7405},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7670},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7936},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8201},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8465},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8731},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8996},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9262},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9526},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9795}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.47,"local_amount":6874,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7474.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437399},{"amount":16.06,"local_amount":7139,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-25T08:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":7762.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842449},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":7405,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-31T08:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8052.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381610463},{"amount":11.32,"local_amount":5029,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5468.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399724008},{"amount":23.81,"local_amount":10582,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T08:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":11506.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409993005},{"amount":18.92,"local_amount":8408,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T09:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":9142.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419757591},{"amount":16.69,"local_amount":7418,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8066.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429407666},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":18282,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T09:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":19879.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439625810},{"amount":20.71,"local_amount":9205,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T09:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10009.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449533408},{"amount":44.23,"local_amount":19658,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T08:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":21374.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468138443}],"funded_date":"2013-01-31T17:42:32Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T08:49:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":523299,"name":"Josinta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josinta is 30 years old, married and the mother of three children who attend school and whose ages are 2, 13 and 15 years old.

He decided to open his own beauty salon when he was living in the community of Los Esteros. Since he always enjoyed this line of work, he decided to continue when he moved to a new community.\r\n\r\nJose offers haircuts for women, men, and children in the beauty salon. He also offers perms and styles hair, among other services. He works with plenty of enthusiasm because he likes his profession very much. Women's haircuts cost $3.50, men's cost $2.50, and children's cuts cost $2.00.\r\n\r\nSome difficulties which Jose faces working in the salon are crime, a lack of time, and rainy periods. Jose has many aspirations for his business. Therefore, he is applying for a loan to buy a hair dryer and a sofa for men's hairstyles, and makeup.\r\n\r\nIn an interview, Jose said: \"My aspirations and goals for my business in the future are to have the necessary clientele to have a better income, to help my relatives as much as I can, and to offer employment to my friends in order to help them.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1286779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a sofa and a hair dryer for styling men's hair.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":46.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":54.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":56.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":40.66,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T08:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":40.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013739},{"amount":46.35,"local_amount":46.35,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":46.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356454103},{"amount":45.99,"local_amount":45.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":45.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459938},{"amount":47.75,"local_amount":47.75,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":47.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373088253},{"amount":48.31,"local_amount":48.31,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":48.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381632398},{"amount":49.69,"local_amount":49.69,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":49.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390496243},{"amount":50.55,"local_amount":50.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-25T08:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":401233574},{"amount":51.7,"local_amount":51.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410489401},{"amount":219,"local_amount":219,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-21T09:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":219,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420517794}],"funded_date":"2013-02-03T10:39:10Z","paid_date":"2013-11-21T09:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":523310,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane repaid her last loan and from the proceeds joined a group of other farmers who are undertaking livestock farming.

Because of this, he bought his own business in the market when he had the opportunity to do so; he knew that this type of business yields good profits.  \r\n\r\nToday, he feels very satisfied and wants to continue improving his business while maintaining the site with the best conditions and good prices.

He will use the loan money to buy beef, pork, and cold meats in greater quantities in order to obtain the best prices.  He also needs the loan because the carnival festivals (alluding to the celebration of Barranquilla) are approaching and he should be prepared, since the sales increase in this season both during and after the festivals.  \r\n\r\nThe meats are the ingredients needed in all of the dishes, especially in the three-phase stew (a soup with three types meat), which is the meal most consumed by his clients in order to sustain themselves or to get ride of a hangover or other discomfort that can happen after consuming alcoholic beverages.

She did not have the opportunity to go to school, but she has several businesses that help pay her household expenses. \r\n\r\nShe is applying to Vision Fund and Kiva for a loan to stock her grocery store and to buy condiments to make the sandwiches she sells. She opened her store 10 years ago and never imagined that the business would be so helpful. Her husband supported her initiative because his income alone would not cover their children's  education and household expenses.\r\n\r\nIt takes Cristi little time to prepare the sandwiches because she used to sell food; however, at times she doesn't have enough money to buy good cooking utensils, dishes, and so forth. The loan will help her buy items now to get her kitchen running again. Cristi says that the grocery store is going well, though the uncertainty she is experiencing today is somewhat worrisome. In addition to running the grocery store and kitchen, Cristi attends school. She works most of the day, and her daughter-in-law helps her in the store and kitchen.\r\n\r\nCristi expects both of her businesses to be successful and generate income to improve her and her husband's lives. She is grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva for the loans they have granted her to sustain her businesses.

Before, there were only four members but two more have now joined.  They say that they really enjoyed working with Vision Found and Kiva and so decided to come back for another loan.  The members themselves chose the group's name as \"alcatraz\" means \"abundance\".  Ceci is one member of the group.  She is 49 years old and married to Genaro, who works in the country.  Together they have a family with ten children, three of whom still depend on their parents as they are studying.  Ceci has a small grocery story that she started a year ago.  She says that she already had premises but she just had not decided exactly what kind of business to have.  She finally opted for a small grocery store.  Ceci tells us she is very happy with the success she has had with her business as her earning have helped to improve her children and her and her husband's living conditions.  However, what she most likes is being able to chat with customers, and she is always excited to know how they are.  Ceci said \"I really like my business but my only difficulty is I have no fridge for storing cold meats and yoghurts.  Before I sold cheese but with no fridge I had to stop because it would very quickly go off\".  Despite this difficulty, though, Ceci is very happy and very grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva for the loan provided.  Thanks to this financial support, she will be able to realise her dream which is for her grocery store to expand and to sell everything and, laughing, she says, it's \"almost, almost a corner shop\".  With expansion, she can have the necessary support so her children can have a better education.  Just as Ceci has dream, so do the other members of the group.  So, they are applying for this loan to invest in their work.  Juan will invest in the greenhouse for his raspberries; Virginia  will invest in a boiled corn grinder; Raudel will invest in oil for cars; Sara will invest in clothes and finally Guillermo will use his loan for his taxi.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1286860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, bread, eggs, drinks, fried foods, juices and such like.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rahudel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4294.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199277},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4294.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596071},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4294.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663498},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4294.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048915}],"funded_date":"2013-02-04T11:47:44Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:54:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":523322,"name":"Maimuna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maimuna is a 50-year-old, married woman.

She is a hard-working girl with the desire to get ahead. She says that honestly she didn't like school and that's why she only studied through the sixth grade, besides which her mom was not able to cover expenses since the fees were excessive and so she decided to stop going. She comments that from a very early age she has enjoyed working. Now she is part of a group called Quetzal, since she has been asking for loans to improve her business and keep it stocked. She says that she earns a living making and selling costume jewelry. With the new loan she is seeking she wants to buy: silver, elastic, pearled threads, settings, tools, pliers, steel wire, glass and ceramic ornaments, jade or amber among other stones for creating jewelry, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, rings, diadems, hair clips and many other created items. \r\n\r\nShe says that she purchases materials in her area and when she has the jewelry made she goes out to sell it among her acquaintances and to people who pay her because she sells to them on credit, three payments over six weeks, so that it's not so onerous for people to buy. Her dream is to have a large business where she could sell the stones wholesale. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are named Anastasia, Gonzaol, Maribel, Maria del Pueblito, Maricela, Virginia, Martha Isabel, Norma Edith and Maria Concepcion. They are requesting loans to invest in their businesses such as preparation and sales of Mexican finger foods, seasonal produce sales, to purchase supplies for making bread to sell, to purchase items to sell at a grocery store, to maintain a truck used for transport, and embroidering handcrafted clothing items. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6450,"image":{"id":1286896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase silver, elastic, pearled threads, settings, tools, piers, steel wire, glass, ceramic, jade or amber among other stones for creating jewelry, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, rings, diadems, hair clips and many other created items.

","en":"Ninfa is 26 and has enjoyed working since she was very young. Three years ago, she opened a grocery store in her house so that she could help her husband meet household expenses. She started with a small table of sweets, which was successful because there is a high school and elementary school nearby. She added more items such as sodas, juices, and homemade sandwiches. Slowly, the business grew, and now she has a grocery store. She is the single mother of two children (she is separated), and she wants to help her children get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan to stock her store and will also sell to another store where nonperishable items are sold at discount prices. She dreams of expanding her store and having arcade machines the local children can play. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank Las Nenas, which she joined because the women members were pleasant and young-at-heart. The other members are Rosalba, Mar\u00eda del Rosario, Alicia, Rosa, Lizbeth, Mar\u00eda Minerva, Gloria, Alicia, Celia, Claudia Minerva, Ma. Beatriz, Ma. Concepci\u00f3n, and Jenifer. They will use the loan to buy pigs to slaughter for taco fillings; to sell shoes; to sell catalog perfumes and cosmetics; to sell catalog mattresses; to buy ingredients to make tacos; to buy seeds to roast and sell; and to buy supplies to make baked goods to sell.

Trabaja desde las 06:00am hasta las 11:00am.\n\nUna de las dificultades de vender los peri\u00f3dicos debido a su discapacidad la cual es que no tiene sus dos brazos, esta discapacidad el la obtuvo trabajando aproximadamente hace unos 20 a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s cuando \u00e9l trabajaba de fierrero en una empresa y recibi\u00f3 una descarga el\u00e9ctrica y los doctores para evitar que la cangrena  llegue al coraz\u00f3n tuvieron que cortarle los brazos y eso hace que no pueda trabajar con la normalidad de cualquier persona. Pero a pesar de su discapacidad el sigue trabajando para poder darle lo mejor a sus dos hijos. \n\nEl tambi\u00e9n tiene en su casa para mejorar sus ingresos dos departamentos que alquila ya que hace a\u00f1os a \u00e9l le heredaron una casa y aprovecho la oportubidad para poder construir y asi alquilar esos espacios, uno de los departamentos los alquila mensualmente a $ 75 y otro a $ 130.

He's had a business selling the most popular newspapers in Guayaquil, such as \u201cEl universo,\" and  \u201cLa extra,\" and lottery tickets in the center of the city for 10 years.  He works from 6am until 11am.  \r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties he faces in selling newspapers is that he has a disability.  He lost both arms in a work accident 20 years ago.  He was working as a metalworker for a company when he was injured by an electric shock, and the doctors had to remove his arms to prevent gangrene from reaching his heart.  This has made it difficult for him to do normal work like other people.  However, in spite of his disability, he continues to work so that he can provide the best for his two children.\r\n\r\nIn order to generate more income he also has 2 apartments in his house that he rents out, because years ago he inherited a house and took advantage of the opportunity to build and rent out these spaces.  One of the apartments rents monthly for $75, the other for $130.  Ciro has a lot of aspirations for his business and his apartment rentals, and for this reason, he wants to take a loan so that he can make some improvements to the apartments.  This way he can charge more rent and obtain more income.  To do this, he wants to buy paint, cement, and cement blocks for the repairs to the apartments.  \r\n\r\nIn the interview, Ciro told us, \"My plans for the long term are to provide my children with a good education, and improve my house so that I can have more income that is independent from my business selling newspapers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1286841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable

Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds.

","en":"Mar\u00eda is a 57-year-old woman. She had no schooling because of the scarcity of resources in her home. She got married when she was very young to Felipe who is now 63 and who works for himself in farming. They no longer have dependents since all their children are grown and independent. Mar\u00eda was born in Chone but many years ago went to live the Santo Domingo hamlet of the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Santo Domingo connects the Sierra Region with the Coastal Region of Ecuador. The city has become a commercial corridor with a number of growing industries, and as proof, there are various entrepreneurial families who some years ago began their own businesses and now are micro-business owners who help generate employment. Studies reveal that the majority of the businesses began out of hands-on experience and have caught on due to the travel of tourists, business persons and travelers from region to region; furthermore, it is the third-most inhabited city in the country. Mar\u00eda resides in the Puerto Lim\u00f3n Parish of this hamlet, a place which was inhabited by a ts\u00e1chila community and has a number of tourist attractions although it is quite far from the city. In addition, the great majority of the inhabitants of this parish work in crop farming and animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nThree years ago Mar\u00eda was devoting herself solely to household tasks. However, concern for her future in later years took hold in her, and so she decided to contribute also to the sustenance of her home selling pigs and chickens, an activity she she tends to in the mornings, afternoons and sometimes at night when special precautions must be taken on account of weather conditions. Now she has applied for her first loan which will be used to purchase commercial feed and supplies so her animals may have the diet and necessary care that would allow them to grow healthy and strong, which makes them more desirable in the marketplace. Mar\u00eda has tried to take out loans at various institutions and banks where unfortunately they have refused to grant the money, owing to the difficulty in visiting the client in the highly isolated rural area where she lives. Nevertheless Mar\u00eda kept on fighting tirelessly and, thanks to the involvement of Kiva with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, she is happy because she can take the first step towards growing her business and so maintain some savings against chance events that might arise in her and her husband's old age. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1287405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase commercial feed and supplies for raising her animals.

After the tax is paid he will offer a service to local people as a taxi driver. The income of the family will increase, and they will be able to improve their living conditions.
