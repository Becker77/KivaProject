The group members are very hardworking and responsible people characterized by their happiness and their good friendships with each other.  They say they chose the name of their group \"because we used to meet in a huge garden where there was a lot of fruit, such as apples, pears, figs, lemons, etc.  But look where we are now.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are very grateful to and happy about VisionFund and Kiva because they'll be able to invest in their jobs.  Reyna will buy bedspreads and blankets, Petra and Alma Jazm\u00edn will buy crafts, \u00c1ngela will invest in painting napkins, and, finally, Victoria will invest in her sheep.\r\n\r\nFrancisco, who's also part of the group, says he's 35 years old and has been married to Isabel for 15 years.  Together they formed a family with two children who are students.  Francisco has a jewelry business.  He makes a living selling jewelry such as earrings, bracelets, pendant earrings, chains, watches, and bangles.  He makes repairs in the same jewelry business.  He sells athletic t-shirts, stuffed toys, gifts, etc.\r\n\r\nHe says he started his business five years ago because one day his wife dreamed they were selling gold.  One day when they were on a trip to Zitacuaro they bought gold and his wife sold it to her friends, and they saw that it worked out well so Francisco decided to set up a jewelry shop.  Previously he was the manager of a gas station.  He says he liked his job a lot but that the schedule was difficult; he even had to work on the weekends.  This affected his family life with his children and his wife because he hardly saw them.\r\n\r\nFrancisco says that with his severance pay he had the money to set up a small shop where he began selling with only two trays of jewelry.  In time it improved a lot because he learned to do repairs, and now it's going very well for him.  Francisco's very happy with his business: \"Now, with my jewelry shop, I lead a much more peaceful life without stress.  I can manage my schedule and spend the majority of my time with them (his family).  I can even go out on the weekend, which wasn't possible before because of my job.  I can open and close whenever I want.\"\r\n\r\nFrancisco has no problems with his business.  He even gives a job to one employee who helps him tend to the business.  His goal is for his business to grow and to get better earnings to live a better quality of life.

Do\u00f1a Elvira quien forma parte del grupo platica que tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Delfino quien trabaja en el campo desde hace 25 a\u00f1os juntos formaron una familia con cinco hijos de los cuales dos de ellos son aun dependientes que se encuentran estudiando.

It is a group that like to live characterized by the great friendship that is between them. The members of the group talked among each other and chose the name because of where the group began and where they met, on a farm with the name Altamirano\". Elvira, a member of the group, is 44 years old, and is married to Delfino who works in the fields. They started a family 25 years ago with 5 children of whom 2 are still dependents who are studying. Elvira raises sheep for a living, and has done so for 20 years. She began her job because she wanted to help her husband with the household expenses. At that time her 5 children were very young and the expenses were great. It was for this reason and Elvira became motivated to begin raising lambs. She is currently requested a loan from the institution to purchase 2 lambs and pasture. Elvira buys small animals to raise, grow large and strong, and then sell them. She says that many times in the season of parties, weddings, baptisms, etc. they go to her home to purchase the lambs. She says, \"I like very much when my sheep give birth to their lambs. For me it is a big satisfaction because I see the lambs grow.\" Her only difficulty is her lack of a good shed and  and her lambs get sick and die and for Elvira this represents a loss of earning and her investment. Elvira's goal is to be able to have more lambs and pigs to raise and sell, and to increase her income to cover the costs of her children's education so that they can have a better quality of life. Team members are Mar\u00eda Isabel, Patricia, Jessica, Ma Albertha will invest in buying and selling pigs for breeding. Teresa and Mar\u00eda Eva will invest in the purchase and raising of lambs to sell. Finally Anayely will invest in chickens to raise and sell. They are all very grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva for the loan offered to them. It will be a great help to improve their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1287565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

The purpose of this loan is to finish his house, part of it is for his domestic use and another part will be used for his business to generate income to service this loan. His biggest customers are local schools that order desks and the local people from his village. Martin started this business back in 2001 to improve his living standards, the same dream he still harbors. His future plan is to expand this business, and to bring as many youths who have that talent to exercise them and showcase their skills and abilities. This will in turn create jobs for many, and develop him and the country at large. In spite of this, Martin faces challenges in the cost of materials and limited capital but since he is an honest and hardworking fellow, these problems won't be permanent.

They are relatives and they live in a community where the people are characterized by being very hard-working and responsible. \r\n\r\nGaby is one of the members. She tells us she is 37 years old and has been married to her husband Lucio since she was 21. Together they have three children. Two of them are studying and the youngest doesn't go to school yet. \r\n\r\nGaby is a very hard-working person. She works making tortillas but also looks after the grocery shop that her sister Magaly has passed on to her. Gaby says that this time she is applying for a loan to buy corn and products like bread, eggs, milk, soft-drinks, sugar e.t.c To stock her grocery shop by making tortillas has already taken a year and the shop has been going for the same amount of time. Gaby said she wanted to start by making tortillas because she wanted to help her husband with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nGaby said, 'I really like my work and more when there are profits, only at this time I haven't been doing so well considering that at the moment people have corn that they harvested at the end of the year. So right now I wont do well with the profits of tortilla sales, although it's only for a period because half-way through the year people find themselves with no corn and so start to buy tortillas. But I will work harder in the shop to make up for it regarding the profits.'\r\n\r\nGaby's goal is to gain more customers to increase her profits so she will be able to offer her children a better quality of life. Just like Gaby who has dreams, the other members of the group are applying for loans to invest in their businesses. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda will invest in the sale of tortillas and vegetables and Luis Enrique in the grocery store. They are very grateful for and happy with the support given by the institution and KIVA."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1287584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, eggs, sugar, bread, soft drinks, detergents.

The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar, and soap for resale, and will help Agnes to generate greater profits and take care of herself and her young brother.

For the past year, Hafiswa has been working hard to manage her market stall, which sells fresh vegetables. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hafiswa has requested a loan of 600000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh vegetables to expand her business and generate greater profits, and to buy new clothes for herself. Hafiswa hopes that in the future she will be able to own a plot of land. \r\n\r\nHafiswa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

His loan requests have been rejected because of his low income and his lack of experience in his job, which is usually important criteria for the local credit providers. \r\n\r\nThis loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Kakhaber will purchase flour and bran at wholesale prices and resell them for a profit. It will be hard work for Kakhaber, but according to estimations his business will be profitable and increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the trading business to increase his stock and volume of sales.

It has been a profitable project, but it also needs more support to further develop. On several occasions, Bela has asked for loans from local financial institutions to develop her business, but has had no success. The loan requests were rejected because of her low income. \r\n\r\n<p>Bela\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative through Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Bela will cover the costs of purchasing needed basic grocery stock that customers often request. She will purchase stocks of detergent powders and sausages as these products are most in demand. Bela plans to increase her business turnover gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income. Bela will work hard, and she will be able to improve her family's living conditions.

He is a very ambitious young man. He and his friend opened a small shop for selling mobile phones and accessories. This store has been operating for six years and is located in a good commercial area in Khanyounis, which makes the project a profitable one and the only source of income for him, but he needs more support to cover some costs.\r\n\r\nMohammad works very hard to improve his living conditions. He is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a new collection of mobile phones and accessories. This will increase sales and improve Mohammad's income positively. The photo shows Mohammad in his store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He applied for a loan of five million shillings but the branch loans committee only approved three million shillings. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to buy cows, fatten them and later sell them off to get money to back the loan.  Any balance will be used to build a house for his family and pay school fees for his siblings.\r\n\r\nRobert's biggest challenge is access to enough capital.

Hong, a loyal client who has been with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) for the past seven cycles, has fully repaid her loans with success and feels empowered that she can relieve her family's financial burden and make a good living.

She hopes to grow her rice healthfully and fruitfully so as to make a better living and keep her children in school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1264590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and pesticide for her plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ek Phnom district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:05Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Savat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Savong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1100000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":1100000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1100000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373047181},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1100000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:54:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1100000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429641751}],"funded_date":"2013-02-14T18:49:42Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T23:54:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":511732,"name":"Phearom's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phearom is 28 years old and a resident of a rural village of Ek Phnom District, located in Cambodia\u2019s Battambang Province. \r\n\r\nShe is single and earns a living through farming rice, growing cucumbers and catching fish.

Because of the need to support her family, she found it convenient to open a neighborhood store. She has had this business for four years, and this time has given her the opportunity to know about prices and which items to sell and where to obtain them, as well as customers and suppliers. Thanks to her relatives, she managed to stock her business using small loans. Nevertheless, she now sees that within her earnings she also has a margin for her savings, and for this reason she wants to obtain a loan to stock the store better and have better earnings, and with time save for an anticr\u00e9tico [a Bolivian rental agreement in which the rent is paid up front]. She now lives in the house of relatives who gave her shelter for her daughters, but as the girls grow, they will need more space. Se\u00f1ora Petruska also makes pastries and homemade bread, which are also greatly sought after by her neighbors. She says that every day she has to get up very early to satisfy the needs of her customers, since there is also a store very close by with which she has quite a bit of competition, so she sees that if the other store is not open, she has better opportunities for her sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1270361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

years old. He lives in the city of Ica with his partner and their young son, whom he loves and who are his main reason for living. He is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who dedicates all of his efforts to support his family, along with his partner. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and the need to begin working, Mario was not able to study a professional degree in agriculture, but he would have very much liked to do so. In his free time, he likes to watch television. Occasionally he cooks a delicious Carapulcra (a Peruvian stew made with meat and potatoes) to share with his family.\r\n\r\nBy his own initiative and with plenty of effort and dedication, Mario works as a master constructor. He works for eight hours per day, beginning in the early morning. He is happy with his work and he believes it is going well because of his good finishing touches and the friendly manner in which he treats his clients.\r\n\r\nMario is very grateful for the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help, he will be able to buy construction materials such as sand, cement, and bricks, among others. This will be very helpful for him as he completes the construction of his home. He will continue working and putting in effort to achieve his dream of having his own company and providing the best quality of life for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1271904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is a young woman that really enjoys listening to her favorite music and  weaving clothing or adornments to decorate her house. Karina is a young woman that finished high school a few months ago and has already become a small business owner. This exemplary girl makes a living from making and selling woven baskets in the doorway of her house. This type of product is very commercialized in Chincha, which offers everything from chairs to handbags that are pretty, simple and colorful.\r\n\r\nKarina lives in the center of the city where this activity is developed, in the \u201cGrocio Prado\u201d district known primarily for the blessed \u201cMELCHORITA,\u201d a woman that decided to follow the life of God very closely, a beautiful story of faith and grace. This is where people sell all kinds of bracelets and necklaces with images of the \u201cMELCHORITA.\u201d It is also the only place where you can buy the various models and designs of the handbags that Karina sells. She tells us that her mother used to make a living from selling these types of products and that was how Karina learned this art from the time that she was a little girl. Currently she cares for and watches over her mother as she cannot sell any longer because her vision isn't very good, but sometimes she helps Karina weave, because the weaving art is done with the hands. Karina knows that her products are good quality and that she makes products different from the others. She employs a pretty style to be able to compete. For the moment she only sells on Wednesdays and Saturdays. During the week she is dedicated to requests she receives.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time that the Kiva lenders have provided their support. Karina will be able to buy reeds, totora and paint, among other materials that are necessary for making her products, and she will be able to make improvements to her home such as improving the walls and roof. She is very enthusiastic because she knows that if she buys the materials now they will be very cheap, since the prices are lower during this season. Karina has a vision for the future of her fruitful business, so she wants her clients to be loyal with the variety of products she offers. With this increase in earnings she will be able to achieve her greatest dream, \u201cTo be a successful business owner and then to learn another type of art to broaden the variety of her products.\"

Because of its rugged geography, Cuenca is a city that has beautiful landscapes to enjoy and is a UN Cultural Heritage site as of December, 1999. It has various places to enjoy nature and to relax with your family. Its people are friendly, gentle and fighters who work every day to improve their economic situation and to obtain a better future with their families. Their pride is in continuing to maintain their culture and traditions.\n\nOne of the members of this group is Yoni who is seeking a successive loan with the communal family bank. She is a member that has a good sense of humor, is a fighter and a hard worker who can always be found seeking to better herself personally and her family. She told us that she is enjoying good health, as are all of the members of her family. \n\nYoni is 32 years old, is married, and the fruit of this marital union is two children who are 12 and 7 years old. Her oldest son studies in high school and her younger daughter is in a small school in the city. Her husband works as a private employee. They do not have their own home and because of this they rent. \n\nYoni works in different activities that allow her to pay for some of the household expenses. She works fixing up homes and also works selling clothes. These activities give her the time necessary to be able to care for her home. \n\nShe invested her previous loan in the purchase of clothes. The earnings that she obtained were very helpful for her family. She will also invest her new loan in the purchase of clothing to be able to continue growing this activity. The communal bank likes her for her comradery and the solidarity of the group. \n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4200,"image":{"id":1272550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-02-01T08:24:48Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-03T08:24:48Z","loan_amount":4200,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Icela Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Zoila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yoni Alexandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Esthela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Franklin Patricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4180.66,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":348.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":348.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1400.01,"local_amount":1393.56,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1400.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069864},{"amount":700,"local_amount":696.78,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355815930},{"amount":700,"local_amount":696.78,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364526040},{"amount":1050.01,"local_amount":1045.17,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1050.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372926816},{"amount":349.98,"local_amount":348.37,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":349.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381703903}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T21:26:05Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:13:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Hildreth","image":null}},{"id":515282,"name":"Nubia Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Nubia lleva muchos a\u00f1os con su propio negocio de abarrotes y venta de tropigas, los cr\u00e9ditos los ha invertido en este negocio, ahora har\u00e1 lo mismo comprara granos b\u00e1sicos, carnes, l\u00e1cteos, sazonadores y gas para mantener siempre con productos la venta, su vecino le ha ayudado a salir adelante ya que con su problema de sobre peso no puede trabajar o movilizarse mucho, sus clientes la quieren mucho, recibe el apoyo de sus hijos quienes trabajan por cuenta propia, los planes futuros de do\u00f1a Nubia es poner un comedor y una casa hogar para ayudar a los ni\u00f1os de la calle y cuidarlos con todo el amor de una madre.

When she was very young she got pregnant and she married at 18 years of age.  She now has two children, Rafael and Josefina.  The oldest is 1 year old and her daughter is 3 months old.  10 years ago Ana lost her parents and moved into the home of her godparents. They helped her until she was married.  She now lives with her family in the poorest neighborhood in the city of Cochabamba.  It is located in the southern region of Cochabamba in a neighborhood called San Miguel.  She doesn't have any basic services in her home.\r\n\r\nAna sells construction supplies.  Her specialty is selling reinforced slabs.  She sells mostly plastoforms and joists but she needs more money to buy a mixer and a hoist.  This equipment will help her sell more materials because it is common and expected that when these construction materials are purchased, the buyers can borrow a hoist and
