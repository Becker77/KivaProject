They were granted a loan of 150,000 by AMB. They aim to improve their businesses by using this loan.\r\n\r\nHasson is 36 years old, married, and the mother of six children between 15 and four years old. She started a small business selling fruits and vegetables three years ago, but she has found it difficult to accumulate a large amount of money to buy various kinds of fruits and vegetables because most of the profits she makes go to clothes and food for her family and to expenses like school fees. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Hasson decided to apply for a loan of 50,000 YER to expand her business and include new kinds of fruits and vegetables to boost profits. Hasson looks forward to opening a small grocery store in the near future instead of selling her goods in the street. This would attract more customers and improve the family's income and help them pass the poverty line."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1275825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to buy new kinds of fruit and vegetables to boost profits.

This has all happened due to her courage and determination. Because of her work, she is respected in her home.

part of this duo.  She\u2019s married and has four children.  She has been working selling traditional clothing for two years.  She requested this loan to buy traditional clothes because the school term is starting and she sells blouses in school uniform colors as well as fabric and tries to buy sweaters to sell to people at good prices.  She has her capital well-invested because she used it during the Christmas season to invest quite a bit.  She hopes that FAPE will be able to give her support to buy what she needs to earn profits and continue in business.

His eldest son works with him, helping him out; the majority of his customers own country houses. Meanwhile, his wife works in a kindergarten so they both support each other economically. The loan Lucas is seeking is to buy his own motorized lawnmower to ease his work as it is very difficult and time-consuming working alone with only shears and so he can't progress a lot.

She is married and blessed with five children, three (a daughter and two sons) of whom are dependent on her and currently in school. Sokheng makes her living through farming rice. Sokheng has been with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) for two loan cycles already. The past loans have had a huge positive impact on her as well as her family. Sokheng was able to purchase a plot of farm to run her rice-growing business, which provides the source of her family\u2019s income. She is now seeking for a USD 1,000 loan to help her daughter celebrate her marriage. After receiving and using the loan as she intends, Sokheng believes that she will be able to successfully help her daughter get married.

This will be Lon\u2019s second time requesting a loan from VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The past loan enabled him to send his children to school, which makes him very satisfied.

She has used the past loans, which she has fully paid back with success, to keep up the good progress of her business as well as her living conditions. \r\n\r\nNow Meas is applying for a loan of 4,000,000 KHR to buy a tractor to help her in the rice field. She hopes this loan will enable her to increase her crop yield, so as to make a better living and keep her child in school.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1281858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a tractor to help her in the rice field.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Bovel district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-02-01T09:18:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-03T09:18:10Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1023964.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381838369},{"amount":768.75,"local_amount":3000000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3071892.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410225787}],"funded_date":"2013-02-13T23:45:27Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T20:19:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":520436,"name":"Abtehal Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Abtehal Group which consists of four women who live in Aden, Yemen.
