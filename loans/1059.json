He receives all the merchandise and sells it to the local inhabitants. \r\n\r\nAlong with this work, she also sells meals in the evenings in front of her home. This way she manages to raise enough capital to pay her household's expenses and her children's education.

She buys her merchandise from wholesalers, who sell by the bundle, which is good for her because of the low cost and the wide selection. She tells us that she used her loan to purchase an awning, clothes hangers, and bundles of clothing. Her goal for the future is to show her merchandise in bigger markets and Christmas fairs.

He likes his business as he knows it well and he is passing on his experience to his children.  He also likes the income from it, which provides him with the means to support his family and make sure they do not want for anything.  On the other hand, what he does not like is the remoteness of his location, as he does not have basic utilities such as electricity.  However, things are improving with the new programs and he currently wants to expand his business and leave his children with something secure for their future.  This will be his second loan with MFP and he hopes for their support in continuing with his objectives.

She works a lot to be able to give her family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nGemima sells fresh fish of all kinds. She starts very early, going to the fishing docks to buy good-quality, fresh fish at various price points. Later she often sells them on the same port, using a speaker to call out to her customers. She gives her customers the most nutritious and delicious products. She sells door-to-door. She started out selling candies and snacks, and with her earnings plus a loan from MFP she began selling fish.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for more than a year and her husband helps her. She thinks it's profitable because she can make money only working a half day and the rest of the time she can dedicate to her family and her home. She feels good that she brings home good income and always has customers, who she takes care of with an enormous smile and friendly demeanor. Before starting her business she didn't have enough money to cover her household expenses. She has plans to keep working to grow her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her 5th loan with MFP. She is very happy knowing that she has a financial backer because it gives her the guarantee of continuing to work without worry. She is also very happy to be part of her village bank because all of the members are very responsible and united. \r\n\r\nWith the requested 3000 soles, she will buy fresh fish in greater quantities and varieties, because she thinks that with greater variety she will have more sales and improve her profit margins.

She lives in Martvili District with her husband and three children. Ekaterine requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides, they have a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown. Ekaterine sells nuts and cheese locally at a good price. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \r\n\r\nEkaterine requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Ekaterine will purchase an oven.

He recounts that his speciality for more than 15 years is finishing homes i.e. installing windows, laying the floor, ceramic and floor tiles as well as fireplaces in living rooms and other home finishing and decorative details. \"It is vital that to have good judgement as a lot depends on it, and my customers are happy with the results,\" says Cesar. It is because of this ethic that he has so much demand and he hopes to be able to improve his income as he always needs to renew his tools to ensure good finishing, hence the reason for which Cesar is seeking a bit of financial support. \r\n\r\nThis is Cesar's third loan with MFP where he hopes to rely on your help to continue meeting his objectives.

He is married to Graciela who looks after the house and their two children, William and Clarita who are 20 and 18 years old respectively. Together, they are very well set-up in their own house which they bought with their savings. Carlos works selling fresh fish, to do this he gets up very early in the morning and drives to the nearest port to buy his merchandise. Then he drives to the settlements and new towns where he sells in the street, carrying his tray from house to house throughout the day.\r\nHe began this business more than 2 years ago with his own capital and he works alone.\r\nHe considers his business to be quite profitable and it helps him to keep up with the household expenses. On the other hand, seeing the success he has had with his business, he wants to use the profits to invest in a grocery store in his house where his wife could work so that they could share the household expenses and offer a better quality of life to their children. This will be his fourth loan with MFP. He is grateful for the financial help that he will have, which will help him to advance his plans. He is also pleased with his community bank because of the support her receives from the other members. \r\nHe will use the requested loan of $800 to buy a greater variety of fish as well as to add-on to his house so he can open a grocery store, starting out with a small amount of goods. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1287415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a greater variety of fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-02T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-04T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":307.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":316.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":328.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":330.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":352.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":365.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.02},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.15},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":119.36,"local_amount":298.41,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-19T08:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":306.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123033},{"amount":127.07,"local_amount":317.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":325.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868855},{"amount":131.81,"local_amount":329.52,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":338.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577695},{"amount":136.72,"local_amount":341.81,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":350.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529926},{"amount":139.02,"local_amount":347.53,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":356.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974956},{"amount":146.02,"local_amount":365.06,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":374.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996221}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T07:24:15Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":523759,"name":"Lourgen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourgen is 37 years old and lives in Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

He still does not have the money he needs to buy his own land for agriculture, but this hasn't discouraged him at all. To the contrary, he works harder every day, saving what he can to buy land in the future. \r\n\r\nHe now has seven years of experience growing potato, ulluco, New Zealand yam, mashua, barley, broad beans, and peas. He rents land from his community because it costs less and in that way he can help support the growth of the community. After each harvest, he travels into the capital to sell his vegetables. He travels twice a week, taking mashua, peas, and potatoes, which he sells at retail in the \"La Parada\" market, the largest in the country.

She is pictured with 10 One Acre Fund farmers \u2014 six women and four men. Teresa is standing on the right with her hand raised. She is receiving an input loan for half an acre of maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. Teresa first enrolled with One Acre Fund during the 2006 Long Rains season and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. Teresa joined One Acre Fund in order to access the best input prices of fertilizer and hybrid seeds as well as to learn more about proper farming.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Teresa was only able to harvest 1.5 bags of maize per 1 acre, but after One Acre Fund's Long Rains 2012 season, she was able to harvest eight bags per half acre! She plans on using future profits from the harvest to save for the future and send her children to school. \r\n\r\nDuring the 2013 Long Rains season, each group member will receive half an acre of agricultural inputs on credit. Teresa's group will receive 5 acres worth of inputs on credit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1287900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bungoma South","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-02-02T18:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-04T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shadrack","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roseline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meshark","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":55000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":57005.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602616}],"funded_date":"2013-02-04T08:15:19Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:21:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":523825,"name":"Constance","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Constance is 26 years old and lives in the Jacob Town area.

He is married, and is the father of six grown children who are all independent.  He is a merchant who has a tire repair shop.  He started this business 15 years ago.  He decided to start his own business because there was no work, and he needed to have way to earn a living.  This is why today he has his tire repair shop.  His shop is located in a very busy area where many of his customers pass through, and so it's a good place for business.  He feels very satisfied with the earnings that his business generates.

El origen del nombre de la comuna viene del mapudungun (lengua mapuche): \"kila\", que significa \u201ctres\u201d y \"kura\" que significa \u201cpiedra\u201d, por lo que se deduce que el nombre de Quilicura equivale a \"tres piedras\", como  el nombre que le dieron los primeros habitantes de este valle en referencia a los tres cerros que son perfectamente visibles y que delimitan la comuna. \n","en":"This group is called \u201cLos Perseverantes VIP\u201d and is made up of 15 entrepreneurs who have businesses including clothing, cosmetics, and food sales.

He is already at his place of work when the sun comes up and is preparing all sorts of food for his customers.\r\n\r\nHe buys all of his supplies in the central market in La Vega, known for selling at very good prices.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan to buy a churrasquera (to make churrascos).  This will allow him to prepare orders quickly.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a restaurant and personally provide financially for his family.  What motivates him the most to keep this business is to buy a home of his own because they live at his in-laws\u2019 house.

The origin of the name comes from Mapudungun (Mapuche language): \u201ckila\u201d means \u201cthree\u201d and \u201ckura\u201d means \u201crock,\u201d from where the name Quilicura is derived.  It means \u201cthree rocks,\u201d a name given by the first inhabitants of this valley, referring to the three mountains that are perfectly visible and delineate the community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4675,"image":{"id":1287965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Quilicura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2013-02-02T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-04T21:50:03Z","loan_amount":4675,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabel Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Constanza Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia Valesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen Lizbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Jose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlene Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":2196861,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140214},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":151842},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":152880},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":153918},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":154971},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":156018},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":157086},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158154},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159225},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":160317},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":161403},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":162501},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163611},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":164721}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":323.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":332.01},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1274.38,"local_amount":598854,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-28T08:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":601137.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347067266},{"amount":1332.64,"local_amount":626229,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-30T08:50:42Z","rounded_local_amount":628616.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355813304},{"amount":1664.11,"local_amount":781992,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":784973.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364523476},{"amount":403.87,"local_amount":189786,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":190509.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924385}],"funded_date":"2013-02-09T21:50:09Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:18:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

The start-up loan program provides for business start-ups, and re-startups.

As he watched his parents run their business, he learned how to properly run a business.  And he helped numerous family and friends with their business plans.\r\n\r\nToday, Emmanuel\u2019s online business, Basket Box, has undergone many transformations. He knew with a broad business name, he could fill gift baskets with almost anything. His latest goal is to sell globally.\r\n\r\n\u201cI began Basket Box in 2004 and the concept then was still with the boxes but incorporated entertainment:  CDs, DVDs and games that would be included with a snack,\u201d he says. That business was strong but not strong enough to keep up with the burdensome prices of media.  He closed in three months.   \r\n\r\nEmmanuel then launched an online job search engine, but over the years, the Basket Box concept continued to interest him.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel conjured different concepts for his business, juggling ideas such as selling fresh fruits and artificial flowers, but the hassle of shipping and handling led him to sell nuts and dried fruits instead. He eventually returned to the concept of offering snacks in a reusable box, which act as bowls. Currently, he sells dried fruit: apples, apricots, peaches, strawberries and bananas, 16 types of nuts, some salted, unsalted and even chocolate-covered.  All are available separately from the boxes and customers may purchase a mix of dried fruit and nuts. \r\n\r\nRecently, Emmanuel introduced an auto delivery subscription for gourmet nuts \u2013 a service through which subscribers receive the same kind of nut every month. Also new to his business, Emmanuel carries bowls and scoops, the sale of which comes with a free small sample of dried fruit. \r\n\r\nWorking in the corporate world for 14 years, Emmanuel got tired of that life and being trapped in the same position. \u201cI\u2019m used to being independent while being at work,\u201d he says. But he\u2019s currently trying to expand his business and become a full-time vendor.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad Accion Texas Inc. is here,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 2004, an absence of capital killed the vision of Basket Box.  Small businesses are typically locked out of banks.\u201d A returning client, Emmanuel learned about Accion through a flier. \u201cI\u2019m dedicating those proceeds to marketing. If I use it wisely, we\u2019ll increase revenue.\u201d He purchased an online radio ad that will air on stations such as Pandora and a list of other similar online radio stations. \r\n\r\n\u201cThis is my third loan. Accion always stayed with me. I\u2019m familiar with the staff, which is easy to work with,\u201d he says, adding that he hopes to hire employees as his business grows.\r\n\r\nFeel free to check out his website:

Recently, he couldn't restock more for his business due to the lack of money, which is why he is asking for a youth loan of 150,000 YER from AMB to buy gas cylinders to use for his business. He would like to earn more profits and to continue improving his business and pleasing his customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1288392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth","Islamic Finance"],"use":"to buy gas cylinders to use for his business.

She is 44 years old and is a member of the Los Inversionistas (\"The Investors\") group. She has been in this group for many years and is a very responsible and hardworking woman. She has a sweets stand outside a primary school, where she works from 7:30 in the morning. She also sells winter clothing which she makes herself, such as sweaters, scarves, gloves, hats, and slippers sewn using a hook and needle. \r\n\r\nShe says that she sells clothing depending on the season. When it is hot outside, she sells caps, T-shirts, sandals, and straw hats. She buys some of her merchandise in Mexico City and she makes some herself. She has one daughter, who is studying in primary school. She is very proud of her daughter because she is an above average girl. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan because she would like to stock her business with sewing materials. In the afternoons, she also sells bread on one of the busiest streets in her town, which is called the \"calle de hambre\" (\"street of hunger\") because vendors sell food from their stalls all day long, from six in the morning until one in the morning. \r\n\r\nOne of Clarita's dreams is to have a larger stall, because she cannot fit in everything that she sells and she has to take some things out. The other members of the group are Mariana, Eva de los Milagros, Jos\u00e9 Antonio, Mar\u00eda del Carmen, Eva, Maricela, Marcelino, Lucila, and Esmeralda. They will invest in their businesses, such as a mechanic shop, shoe sales from a catalog, materials for artisan embroidery, supplies to make and sell desserts, the purchase of in-season fruit and vegetables, and the sale of clothing, cosmetics, and women's

Juanita says that the only difficulty is not having a good pigpen to keep her pigs in good condition, and because of the space she can\u2019t raise more livestock, but she and her husband Fidel have the goal of having a bigger homestead in order to have more animals.\r\n\r\nJuanita and the members are very happy and grateful to the institution because for them it will be a big help to continue their productive activities. Agustina will invest in feed for her calves, Leocadia, Sara, and Dolores will invest in lambs, Socorro in clothing sales, Rosa and Elena will invest in pigs, and finally Carmen will invest in sweets for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":1287617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy feed and corn for 10 pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dolores Hidalgo, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-02-03T15:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-05T15:30:01Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leocadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":51000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":12750,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":12752.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199295},{"amount":666.67,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8501.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596088},{"amount":666.66,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8501.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663516},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":12750,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":12752.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048931},{"amount":666.67,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8501.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840101}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T00:23:01Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":523908,"name":"Abejitas Trabajadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jaime tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad es originario de una poblaci\u00f3n llena en riqueza hist\u00f3rica llamada Heroica Zitacuaro ya que tres veces fue quemada y volvi\u00f3 a poblarse despu\u00e9s de quemada.

","en":"Mahbuba is married and has 4 children. She earns her living by raising cattle. She has been involved in this business since her early childhood, as her parents' livelihood was fattening cattle. Mahbuba has several head of cattle, and she also has 2 dairy cows. Every morning she sells her neighbours and her acquaintances milk and dairy products such as kefir and cottage cheese that she makes herself. Her son helps her to raise the cattle. Because they live in a rural area, the cows graze in a pasture where her son watches them and leads them home in the evening. Now it is winter and there is practically no grass for the cows to graze on, so Mahbuba has approached Kiva for a loan to buy feed for her livestock. She wants to buy the feed before spring, fatten the cows, and sell them at a good price come spring. She plans to use the loan to buy feed, and she thanks Kiva in advance for the financial support.  \r\n\r\n\r\n

Gulbarchyn plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business and in the children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1286964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase three cows ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Cholok-Kayin village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-02-03T22:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-05T22:00:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulbarchyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":840},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":735}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":25090.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495479},{"amount":840,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":40144.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426784},{"amount":735,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":35126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552851}],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T20:41:02Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":523248,"name":"Shahnoza","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0428\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0425\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438. \u0415\u0439 23 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0428\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0428\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b, \u0431\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442.

","en":"Kanayim is 47 years old and has a secondary education.  For many years already, she has been the director of her village's public health care program.  Her only son lives with her and happens to be her main helper.  She also has three daughters: the youngest lives with her.  She is a secondary school student who helps her mother during her spare time.  Kanayim's two older daughters are now independent and have their own families.\r\n\r\nBy nature, Kanayim is a pleasant and kindhearted woman.  Her family became involved in farming 30 years ago, even before the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The family now raises livestock and cultivates field crops.  The family's total yearly income comes close to 240,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Kanayim has turned to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 135,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of young bulls and sheep.  She plans to use the profits from this loan to pay for her grandchildren's

He did not have the opportunity to get an education and has been involved in animal husbandry since his youth.  When he was growing up, his family had financial difficulties, which is why he has only been raising livestock.  Now that his children have grown, they also need to create their own families, and Hotamqul is trying hard to gather enough money for their dowries. \r\n\r\nHotamqul currently owns a few head of livestock, but he would like to buy a few more before the spring.  Livestock prices will go up in the spring and if he does not purchase livestock before then, he will not be able to resell at a profit and therefore increase his capital.\r\n\r\nHotamqul is hoping to receive financial support from Kiva, as this is the only way to see his project materialize.

","en":"Saidkhon is an older man at the age of 60 years. He is married and has three children. Saidkhon is engaged in trade of different bags (paper bags, cloth bags) for vegetables and fruits. He is helped in this by his younger son. And his older son is also engaged in trade, but he sells auto parts.

She is working hard to provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 14,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) loan for her to buy fabric, cloth, thread, and other materials needed in her business. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and her children\u2019s education. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nAnita dreams to have a good and prosperous life and hopes that her business will grow even more. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their lives and businesses every week. It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1288570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To

The group name was chosen by Lety, who says that they decided to use this name because the day that the institution called at the house to invite them to apply for their loan, she was very surprised by it and she thought that this was a good choice for a name. \r\n\r\nAnother member, Benita, is 46 and married to Pablo who is a bricklayer.  They have lived together for quite some time and have a family of six children, three of whom still live at home and go to school.\r\n\r\nBenita raises sheep which she buys when they are young, and fattens them for three or four months to sell.  Sometimes a customer wants a baby lamb, which she also sells.  She has been in business for 20 years, \"I began raising sheep through another micro-lending instititution and never ran into any problems, except for sheep illness, but nothing serious.\"  Benita is an enthusiastic worker whose greatest goal is to see her daughters finish their careers so they can have a better quality of life.  The members of the group are very grateful to Vision Fund and KIVA for the loan since it will allow them to improve their business activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":1228748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Comprara 2 borregos y pastura para los mismos borregos.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-02-04T08:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-06T08:20:02Z","loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":135,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Letcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14027.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199296},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":14027.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596089},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":14027.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663517},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":14027.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048932}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T16:32:03Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:55:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":523931,"name":"Familia Castulo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \"Familia Castulo\" es la segunda vez que esta solicitando el credito a la institucion ellos solo son tres integrantes son familiares y son perosonas muy serias (responsables) en cuanto al trabajo que realizan les gusta mucho trabajar para mejorar su vida.

All three members are family and very responsible people who enjoy the work they do to lead a better lifestyle.  Esther is one of the members of the group and she is 38 and married to Rogelio.  They have three school-aged children.  Esther and Rogelio have a small sewing shop where they make all kinds of clothing, such as coats, pants, jackets, etc.  They have been in business for ten years and, apparently, the business comes from Esther's side of the family.  But when they married they decided to open their own business.  They take the clothing they produce to Mexico City where they sell it at a good price.  They know the area very well because that is where they are from originally.  The only problem they run into is when something does not sell well or when one of their sewing machines breaks down and affects the quality of their work.\r\n\r\nEsther and Rogelio say:  \"Our goal is to be able to sell our clothing wholesale one day on a large order basis, and not like we do now having to go to the city to make a sale.  If we are able to have a fixed customer base we can give our children a better lifestyle and renovate our house.\"  Another member, Micaela, will use the loan to buy sweets and second-hand shoes to sell.

All the members live in the same village by the name of Nungsai Chiru Village in the Senapati district of Manipur which is in the North Eastern part of India. The one and only reason why the group was formed is \u2018coming together to help one another and supplementing family incomes by accessing loans\u2019.\n\nJahonghoi is the profiled member pictured with raised hand. She is 42 and has a son and a daughter, who are both being sent to a private boarding school for a better education. The school is located some 40 kms from her native village. Her husband, who is a peon by profession, works at the village water supply office. His monthly wage (salary) is just enough to manage their children\u2019s boarding school costs. In order to supplement the family income, Jahonghoi has taken up the business of buying and selling firewood. She buys firewood wholesale from one place and sells it retail to different places. Though the business can be expanded, she has to stick to her capacity because she cannot afford it financially. With some profit she earns, she is helping her husband in keeping the family going. This was how she tried to earn income before she accessed loans.\n\nWith some part of her first loan in 2011, she was able to expand her firewood business to some extent. With the remaining part of the loan, she managed to add some more activities to her business like selling vegetables and bananas as she found favorable with time and place. Adding more activities was also quite helpful as they could be done on a daily basis. She still wants to expand her business based on a daily, weekly and monthly basis because she finds that her income flow was better and it also helps her in repaying her loan.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result for better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nGracia hopes that her business will grow even more and dreams to provide her children with a good education and a good life.

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan with her husband, two sons, and two daughters. She has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. Her husband has been running a grocery store in the market in which he is selling rice, pulses, beans, and flour. This store is the only source of income for the family. Currently the stock of rice of his store is finished therefore he wants to purchase rice packs for his store.

Her monthly profit from selling foods is 400 AZN and it increased after obtaining a loan from AqroInvest.  She is a very successful entrepreneur because of a good location in the central bazaar of her home city.  \r\n\r\nThe profit she gains is not enough to reinvest into the business and being able to cover customers' demand is suffering for this reason. Being the main source of income, her profit is used for family needs. Antiqa would like to increase her sales and invest additional capital. For this purpose, she applied for 1,600 AZN.
