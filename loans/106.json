He is married with 11 children, three of whom are still in school as he also takes care of three grandchildren and one orphan. Benedicto has had multiple businesses -- poultry, bricklaying and the sale of produce -- in Kitega for 29 years. His major business challenges are the changes in prices depending on the season. He is able to make about 200,000 Ugandan shillings in profits a week and that helps him in taking care of his family and saving for future developments. His dream is to spread his business to other areas apart from his village as well as to build rental houses for monthly earnings.\r\n\r\nBenedicto needs a loan to help buy more feed for his chicken as well as more produce for resale, since loans have boosted his businesses.

She is 46 years old and serves as the leader for this 11-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rosalia T. Group.\r\n\r\nRosalia is married and has 2 school-aged children. Rosalia owns a general store where she sells daily use products like shampoo, soap, and toothpaste. Rosalia has been in business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nRosalia joined ASKI last year to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalia has successfully repaid a 5,000 PHP loan from ASKI, which she used to purchase additional goods for her store. Rosalia is now requesting her second loan, in the amount of 7000 PHP, so she can buy new items for her store. She hopes to earn additional revenue so she can improve the living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She runs a small business selling new clothes and shoes from her home, and occasionally she sells her merchandise on the streets of her community. She has been in this business for a year. Starting with some savings, she decided to invest in clothing sales because this is the kind of merchandise most people need.\r\n<p>\r\nChristella began her association with Esperanza International Dominican Republic because she was in need of capital, as were her group members and their families. Her story is representative generally of her group and of Esperanza's Dominican and Haitian clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti. Her group is located in the town of Hato Mayor whose economy depends on farming. It is one of the most rural towns in the Dominican Republic. In this town, as in many others, there is a population of Dominicans and Haitian emigrants as well as a scarcity of potable water and electricity. \r\n<p>\r\nChristella is requesting a loan to buy a better selection of clothes and shoes to sell. It is her goal to own her own store where she can offer more variety in her merchandise. Christella is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza. She hopes to provide for herself and her child while doing business and, within a few years, save up enough to buy her own home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":691796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothes and shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2011-01-13T19:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Theonide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irlande","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Castin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miquella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":71000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5378.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5478.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5581.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":5685.4},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5791.49},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5899.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6009.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6121.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6236.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6352.58},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6471.18},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5993.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.32},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.96},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.08},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.24},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.45},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":445.69,"local_amount":16438.55,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":16646.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414335},{"amount":311.17,"local_amount":11476.89,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":11622.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991216},{"amount":322.89,"local_amount":11909.24,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12059.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275289},{"amount":335.06,"local_amount":12358.01,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":12514.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142548},{"amount":347.69,"local_amount":12823.76,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12986.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211215544},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":5993.55,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-01T08:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6069.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216493936}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T20:46:08Z","paid_date":"2011-08-01T08:01:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":269016,"name":"Mejumaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mejumaa is a married woman with three children, all of whom attend school.

She earns her living by operating a fish vending business. Her husband Willy, who is 44 years old, works as a fish vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 15 to 23 years old. One of the children has their own family and two are currently going to school. Mylaluna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 23 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mylaluna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 24th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 for additional capital for her fish vending business so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements & the education of her children. Mylaluna is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Wendy started the business when she saw that the family\u2019s finances were poor and sometime there was not enough food to eat.  This happened because her husband was let go from a company and because of his age, was not able to find a good job.  Thus she took on the task of working in a business where she would make her own money, be her own boss, support her husband with the expenses, and allow them to work together to prosper.  \r\n\r\nWendy gives good service to her customers in the business and it is growing.

You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally. Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.

Every two weeks she travels to Luweero, a village about two hours away, to buy 50-100 sacks of charcoal.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

SPBD's loans are Tulua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tulua F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

In the area where she lives, Mar\u00eda is very well-known for being a hardworking, responsible woman and above all an honest woman. Many people prefer her products since she offers variety, quality and good prices.\r\n\r\nThis business is Mar\u00eda's main source of income. That motivates her to be very attentive and always watching the business's direction. In other words, she is always looking to be a step ahead of the competition so her business will be the area leader in perfumes. All this has led her to ask INTEGRAL for a loan. She is very grateful to the institution for the economic help it gave her in the past to start her business.\r\n\r\nThis time she is asking for the loan to buy a variety of perfumes so her customers always find what they are looking for and so they are satisfied with her service. In this way she hopes to sell more products and increase her income, which will allow her to offer better living conditions to her family, especially her children, whose needs grow everyday."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":978846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-01-14T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":31.44},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":34.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":37.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":39.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":40.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":47.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":48.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":52.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.46,"local_amount":31.46,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":31.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116219},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":34.99,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":34.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241330},{"amount":37.3,"local_amount":37.3,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":37.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269966282},{"amount":38.08,"local_amount":38.08,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":38.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276573570},{"amount":39.5,"local_amount":39.5,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":39.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283319147},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":40.91,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":40.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049443},{"amount":42.37,"local_amount":42.37,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":42.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521087},{"amount":43.62,"local_amount":43.62,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":43.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329729},{"amount":45.65,"local_amount":45.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":45.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349561},{"amount":146.12,"local_amount":146.12,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":146.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315320932}],"funded_date":"2012-01-20T13:24:29Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:15:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":383804,"name":"Rosalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalia is 46 years old and lives in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been engaged solely in selling for six years. When she started, she did it with a part of the severance from her job. With the support of her husband, she was able to help cover living expenses, since everything is expensive and you must have initiative to get better income and be able to get by and obtain your goals. Due to a lack of funds, she has no clothing, only jewelry. This is why she neds to invest in clothing for uniforms to be able to sell such as: skirts, shirts, pants, socks, undershirts, and to purchase a variety of clothing to grow the business'  inventory.

She is married and has 2 school-aged children. She has been involved in farming for seven years already. She helps her husband maintain their rice farm and sell their harvest to the market. A few years back, she opened a small bake shop located at their house. She says she and her husband decided to venture into this kind of business so they would have another source of income that would sustain their family, especially their children's education. \r\n\r\nDaisy joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Daisy has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Daisy is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment and also supplies for her bake shop. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Daisy from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

They have three children who are 26 to 32 years old. All of them have their own families. Gigilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gigilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 30,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 for additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future renovation of their house.

She did not have the opportunity to go beyond 7th grade in school. At age 17, she became pregnant for the first time by a boyfriend who did not want to take on the responsibility, and so Ezelina stayed in her parents' home. It was another start to difficulties in life and, as she tells it, she saw a world full of uncertainties. A few months later, she asked her father for support in the amount of 100 meticais (US$4) to start a business to be able to support the child she was eagerly expecting. At that point, business was not going well (yet another frustration) and she chose to look for a job at kiosks and, with the typical problems of a first pregnancy, she couldn't handle the work hours and had to return to the business that she had been doing. Conscious of the first failure, she contacted a group of women to hear about their experiences with the use of credit and to learn to save.\r\n<p>\r\nShe currently has a business that performs well and operates in a precarious mini-store and plans to remodel as soon as she obtains a refrigerator to expand the business with a range of products.\r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to enroll her older child in a secondary school, continue to bring a varied selection of essential products close to her customers and improve the conditions of the mini-establishment.

Aos 17 anos contraiu a primeira gravidez de um namorado que n\u00e3o quis assumir a responsabilidade, assim sendo, Ezelina permaneceu em casa dos pais e era mais um princ\u00edpio de dificuldades na vida e, segundo conta, via um mundo cheio de incertezas. \r\nPoucos meses depois, solicitou ao pai um apoio no valor de 100,00mtn ( 4, usd) para iniciar um negocio para poder sustentar o filho que esperava com ansiedade.

He and two brothers work the lands with their father, who is now getting older and cannot work as much as he once was able to. On his lands he has cattle and he also grows rice. He hopes that he can continue to make profits with his work so that one day he can save up for his own home. He has three children who live with him, two of whom are still in school. He hopes he can continue to educate his other children, now that his oldest has graduated as an agricultural engineer. <\/p>\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Buena Suerte de Salitre Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Buena Suerte Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security.

Eisha has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and now requires a loan of $850 in order to purchase additional stock in bulk.

Won\u2019t they just take the money?\u201d  The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually the \u2018poor\u2019) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than \u2018ordinary\u2019 people.  Whether or not this is true is somewhat irrelevant for a number of reasons.  \r\n\r\nFirstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk.  More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive.  The incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026 The incentive to have on-going access to financial

Their high quality products are in much demand and they have been receiving major orders from an ever growing clientele. To meet this growing demand they decided to join the loan program of the Soro Yiriwaso  (microbank) two years ago.The amounts of their loans has gone from a first loan of 50,000 francs CFA to their fifth loan of 150,000 francs CFA.<p>\r\nBesides their principle business, they manage other activities such as the sale of incense (natural scents known for their odour and smoke) and \"henn\u00e9\" (plant leaves that darken the hands and feet). They buy \"bazin\" ( a white cloth, popular in West Africa) in the city of Bamako as a group purchase, then dye the product to various designs and colors (to customer request) in Kimparana. The finished products are sold in Kimparana and Koutiala to a wide range of clientele. They each expect to earn a profit of 180,000 francs CFA over the life of the loan which will be used to meet ongoing family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by David Gibbons, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":218063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of \"bezin\" (white cloth) for dyeing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinimgnini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-18T14:09:48Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974056},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889429},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440222},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135590},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033391},{"amount":295.85,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":150443.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620793}],"funded_date":"2008-11-04T14:09:48Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":75650,"name":"Pham Thi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Pham Thi X. lives in Hung Yen commune, Hung Nguyen district, Nghe An province.

for agricultural tasks. Yusufjon has been dedicated to cattle farming for 2 years. He started this business as a young man, with his father's support. He is presently the father of 3 children of various ages. He makes a great effort in order to meet the needs of the children in his charge and to bring sustenance to his humble home. His greatest need now is to buy young cattle for expanding his business. For this reason, Yusufjon turned to IMON International, in order to obtain loans that will allow him to purchase these animals and make his business advance.   <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her family of seven, which includes her children and her parents. Education for the children is a high priority in the family. Sharoti operates a stationery shop where she sells books, papers and other scholastic items.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is Mrs. Neema D., proudly displaying a new delivery to add to her collection of intricately patterned batik cloths and stylish local dresses. However beautiful her cloths may be though, there are many other shops in Dar es Salaam selling similar stock, so competition is stiff. Neema therefore wants to strengthen her business by diversifying. She requires a loan of $275 so that she can also begin selling tailoring supplies such as buttons, pins, zips, needles, lining\u2026small things, yes, but things that are in high demand in Tanzania, where most people have their clothes custom-made (this is actually cheaper and obviously much more interesting!) and then mended when they tear or fray. Neema hopes that this new venture will generate a constant turnover that will enable her to continue assisting her husband to support their family of three children.\r\n\r\n<p> About the microloan partner:\r\n<p>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

He is farmer who has a small piece of land to cultivate rice for a living. On his farm, he now faces a small problem because his field has infertile soil which is affecting the crop. Thus, he decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizers to support the field. He will use the rest of the loan to buy fuel to support the field to make his crop more productive. His wife, Mrs. Lis Pong, is a recycling collector who buys waste such as empty bottles, cans, plastic and so on to re-sell in a recycling factory. Mr. Moa U. is 35 years old and the father of five children, two of whom are recycling collectors while two others help him in farming and the youngest one is attending the local school. Another loan member, Mr. Khorn K. did not come to take a loan but his wife did, so she is presented in the picture instead him.

This will be his first loan from Ameen. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.).

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. Cresenciana is able to be consistent in paying her dues because she used the loan money to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of additional capital to aid in buying groceries needed to replenish her varitey store's inventory. She will also invest some of the loan to purchase raw ingredients needed for her rice cakes. She dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Her husband Dioberto, who is 38 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 6 to 17 years old. Evangeline joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evangeline has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to buy feed for the pigs and more kitchen utensils to resell to save up for her children's future education. Evangeline is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Since childhood, she has worked in the fields, where she learned what was essential. Currently she is retired, as due to her advanced age it isn't possible for her to expend much physical effort in the fields.  For this reason, she has opted to work selling food as a street vendor, specifically preparing hot dogs with french fries from the mobile stand which is the principal tool required for her work. She does this activity in the evenings, until the late hours of the night.  On the other hand, she also works doing weaving by hand and selling her finished products.

Margarita is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cEl Tiempo es Oro\u201d (Time is Gold), which is in the District of Juanjui, Mariscal C\u00e1ceres Province, Department of San Mart\u00edn.  She is 40 years old, married, and the mother of three dependent children.\r\n<p>\r\nMargarita is a hardworking and determined woman who decided to start her own business selling soft drinks out of her home, which is a well-suited location.  She manages her business without a set schedule and does not have to report to a boss.  Margarita says that she started her business with 300 soles and bought six packs of sodas.  Her products sold very well so she gradually invested in more merchandise.  Today she continues to manage this same business and is known among her customers, who are her neighbors, relatives, and friends.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 2000 soles, she will purchase packs of sodas in different flavors, sizes, and brands.

Djuraboy was born in 1959 and is married with two children. As an aspiring and hard-working man, he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. Thus, when he joined IMON International, he was able to make much progress with his previous loans, which he invested mostly in crop farming. For 20 years, Djuraboy has been growing potatoes, wheat and vegetables on his land. His sons help him with the business. Djuraboy wants his children to get a good education, allowing them to have a better chance to succeed in the future - this is what makes his sacrifice worthwhile. Thanks to his efforts and diligence, now his elder son is studying at the University. Currently Djuraboy requests 7,000 Somoni in order to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer. He plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He decided on doing his work because he wanted to have an independent job since he prefers working on his own and wanted no need to depend on anyone. \r\n\r\nToday, for the fourth time, he has requested a loan from A. Majmoua, a Kiva partner, to purchase tools for his work, as well as pay his children's school tuition fees. His previous loans allowed him to improve his work and purchase more sophisticated tools.

She has been in this business for 10 years, and she works six days out of every week. Lukia sells her products from home, by means of retail. \r\n\r\nLukia has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more bales of second-hand clothes. She also generates additional income through selling piped water. The main business challenges for Lukia include the ever increasing prices of second-hand clothes and the rainy season.  \r\n\r\nHer goals and aspirations for her business are to be a wholesaler and also buy a plot of land to build a permanent business premise. Lukia lives in a home that she owns; she has access to electricity but doesn't have access to piped water. Her major monthly expenses include school fees and medication.
