He has this message for those who provided his funding: \"I am very grateful for the financial support I have received from the foundation and from Kiva and it is thanks to this that I have achieved this standard of living for my family.\"  \r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for another Kiva loan which he will use to make bulk cash purchases of snacks and soft drinks.

celebrations by wearing disguises, drinking, eating in Nivaldo's pub and dancing to the rhythm of Caribbean

It groups together 7 women who got to know each other thanks to family and neighbourly relationships. They have an average age of 50, are married and have, on average, 4 children. They all have different businesses, such as the buying and selling of condiments, like Sitan, who is standing up in the back row in the picture. They all live in extended, traditional family environments in Ouelessebougou, in the prefecture of Kati (Koulikoro region, Republic of Mali). They have all been small traders for several years and are highly sought after in their line of work. The members of the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program 2 years ago, in order to be able to satisfy the growing demands of their customers, and are on their 3rd group loan.\r\n\r\nSitan, who is the group's leader and very well-known in Ouelessebougou, excels in the sale of condiments. She plans to use her loan to buy a large inventory of all sorts of food condiments (peppers, tomatoes, onions, tomato concentrate, cabbage and sumbala, a condiment made from n\u00e9re seeds). She gets her supplies in Bamako and from the local wholesalers, and sells her condiments to a retail client\u00e8le in Ouelessebougou, for cash or credit to a customer base composed of men and women.

In addition, she sells different clothes in the streets, like shirts, skirts, shorts, camisoles, pants and shoes.\r\n\r\nShe started this activity due to the difficulties her family was going through and the problems that came with her father\u2019s death. As a little girl, she only had her mother\u2019s support, who taught her this line of work so she could support herself and help support her seven siblings.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy materials for tailoring dresses and stock her business with new clothes. Her biggest dream is to have more capital in order to provide her children with a good education so that they grow to be good professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1288083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

acciones educativas tendientes a su formalizaci\u00f3n y mejoramiento productivo. All\u00ed mismo est\u00e1 Vanessa, quien desde muy joven, a sus 17 a\u00f1os,  se inclin\u00f3 por el comercio, y su padre fortaleciendo su \u00edmpetu, le dio el capital semilla para ello; as\u00ed mismo recibi\u00f3  impulso su dos amigas, quienes la hicieron so\u00f1ar con el que hoy es su negocio, donde vende calzado en las l\u00edneas formales e informales principalmente. Sus ventas las realizan de contado y con una frecuencia diaria,  desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 9 de la noche y sus compras las hace en almacenes  ubicados en el centro de la ciudad y a cr\u00e9dito.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo es tener un capital de trabajo suficiente para tener inventarios suficientes que le faciliten impactar a su clientela y vender mucho m\u00e1s. \n\n","en":"Vanessa is 22 years old and lives in the south of the city in a neighborhood where Barranquilla ends and the municipality of Soledad begins. Here formal economic activities are focused on including work in malls and stores while informal activities occur around them. The local state has relocated them to a commercial plaza where they are now concentrated. Here with their owners, educational action is being taken to formalize their work and improve their productiveness. \r\n\r\nVanessa works here, who since she was very young at 17 years old, began selling goods. Her father strengthened her impetus and gave her seed capital for it. Here she received the encouragement of two friends who made her dream of what has today become her business, where she sells footwear in formal and informal styles. She makes her sales in cash and on a daily basis from 9 am to 9 pm. She makes her purchases in warehouses located in the center of the city and on credit. \r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which she willl buy with cash and in large volume attractive footwear for one of the most important parties of the city. The Barranquilla Carnival comes with an extravagance of color and masks that reflect the ways of the Caribbean people. This is one of the most commercial times of the year in the department of Atl\u00e1ntico. Her goals are to strengthen their business by purchasing in cash and in high volume. This is just the reason why she is applying for a Kiva loan, with which she will buy sandals and flip flops with designs for the happiest time of the year in the city and Colombian Caribbean. Her greatest challenge is to have enough working capital to have sufficient inventory that will help her impress her clientele and selll much more.

Uranchimeg, 37 years old, lives with her husband and four children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Her husband had the profession of teacher and now runs a clothing sales business. The clothes he sells are imported from China at a reasonable price, and even though the business has been running just for seven months, it has attracted quite a number of customers. She herself is a senior teacher of linguistics at the university. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair, so she is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to purchase construction materials such as paint, planks and bricks, etc. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable and warm place. More importantly, during winter time, the house will enable the family to use less coal for heating, and that very process contributes to the efforts against air pollution. Also, at this time of year in Mongolia, the price of construction materials is at its lowest, so buying now will spare a considerable amount of money for the family, and this money can be invested in important expenses such as education, food and entertainment.

He lives with his wife and four children in Dornod, an eastern province of Mongolia. His eldest daughter works as a saleswoman in a supermarket, the second-eldest daughter studies at university, and the two youngest children attend high school. His wife, age 53, is a homemaker. \r\n \r\nThe house the family lives in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. Also, since the children are growing each day, the house has reached its capacity in terms of space. For this reason, Mr. Jargalsaikhan is requesting a loan in the amount of 1,500,000 MNT, which he will use to purchase construction materials such as planks, bricks, cement, and dry boards. He will utilize these materials to repair the house and to build a barn. As a result, the family will be able to live in a more comfortable and spacious place. Most importantly, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.\r\n \r\nAt this time of year, the price of construction materials is usually at its lowest, so purchasing them now will save a considerable amount of money for the family.  \r\n \r\nMr. Jargalsaikhan is a very hard-working individual who would like to see all his children successfully employed in the future.

In this same place he has a shop where he sells everyday family items, in small quantities in accordance with the buying possibilities of his customers, principally neighbours from his neighbourhood. His customers meet, talk and share while they do their daily shopping, as each shop is a cultural meeting point in this neighbourhoods of the city. Companionship between all is noticeable., especially among the housewives in their daily chores.\r\n\r\nHe started his business a year ago, making the most of his wife's experience in this type of business activity thanks to her family traditions and the opportunity they saw in this highly commercial area, as there was no competition and neighbours had to travel to other areas. His daily activities start at 6:30 am and carry on until 9:30 pm, Monday to Sunday. He does all this in the hopes of generating more income progressively to provide his family with better well-being.\r\n\r\nHis future goal is to have his own well stocked shop but for this he needs to grow and to have enough working capital, which he does not yet have.

Nevertheless, the rains stop her business from running normally as she must stop working until Mother Nature puts an end to these difficult weather conditions.  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish her business more, Jannet needs to start selling cold beverages and drinks made with local fruits.  She will then be able to attract more customers and thus earn more money.  Her future plan is to expand her business \u2013 as much as her house will allow \u2013 by having tables and other furniture.  This is Jannet\u2019s first loan with MFP and she is grateful for the opportunity.  She hopes to make the loan repayments on time.\r\n\r\nShe needs 1000 Nuevo Soles to invest in a refrigerator to stock up her business with cold beverages.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1288852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a refrigerator to stock up her business with cold drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-04T16:40:37Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-06T16:40:37Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jannet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":109.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":116.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":114.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":124.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":124.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":132.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.14},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":140.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.91,"local_amount":109.77,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-19T08:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":113.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123042},{"amount":46.79,"local_amount":116.97,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":120.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868864},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":114.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":117.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577704},{"amount":49.83,"local_amount":124.59,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":128.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529935},{"amount":49.68,"local_amount":124.2,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":128.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974966},{"amount":53.11,"local_amount":132.77,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":136.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996230},{"amount":54.86,"local_amount":137.14,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":141.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863758},{"amount":56.09,"local_amount":140.23,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":144.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352234}],"funded_date":"2013-02-13T20:44:03Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:01:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":524130,"name":"Zubaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Zubaida is 53 years old and a married woman.

Maimouna is the only person wearing a black outfit in the photo. The group members live in traditional large families in Keleya, in the Bougoni prefecture   (Sikasso Region of Mali). They have been in retail for many years and have a good customer following.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of meeting the growing customer demand, six years ago the group members have decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program. They are on their fourth solidarity loan. Maimouna, who is the group\u2019s leader and well known in Keleya, excels at selling cereal pancakes. She plans to use her loan to buy for bags of millet and other ingredients. She stocks up in Keleya and nearby and sells her pancakes in Keleya, retail, for cash and on credit, to a customer base composed of men and women. She hopes to achieve a monthly revenue of 25,000 West African francs, which will allow her to repay her loan and reinvest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1288729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy condiments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Keleya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-02-04T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-06T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maimouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diassan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soundje ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":76202.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347180078},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":76202.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922887},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":76202.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636433},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":76202.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029918},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":76202.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819435},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":76202.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678331}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T18:42:38Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":524134,"name":"Zaira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaira is 63 years old.

She considers her business profitable by the earnings that it affords them as well as by the demand that allows her to sell all of her production.\n\nShe decided to start her business because of the need to have an economic income in order to support her family.

Miguel is in charge of vehicle repairs while Ruth does the administration work and is in charge of a small supply store, with which they get to form a great team where love and work are the pillars of the family.

To support her household she earns a living by selling a variety of merchandise in a small shop, and she is also a manicurist and baker.  Five years ago she began these activities after participating in many courses during which she decided to create her own endeavors, and these became her main sources of income.  \r\n\r\nHer shop is located in a place in her house.  On the weekends she makes cakes to sell to customers who order them, and she works as a manicurist from home.  She does all of this in order to generate an income that supports her family.  From Monday to Sunday, 7:00 in the morning to 9:00 at night, Carmen works without rest in order to get her family ahead in life.  Her main customers are neighbors in the area to whom she sells her products and services on account.  Her goal is to extend her market and little by little she is doing it, but her greatest challenge is not having enough working capital to accomplish this.  \r\n\r\nThis is the reason behind the Kiva loan and her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which will be used to buy a variety of merchandise and supplies for fulfilling and selling cakes in the coming festivals.  Likewise, she will use it to get available nail enamels in order to do nails appropriately for the carnival season, which is approaching.  Her future goal is to have her own home.  This is why she gets up every day with a strong vision of her intention, as this can improve the success of her children in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1287529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married and has two children who are currently in school. For the past ten years, Naku has been working hard to manage her restaurant, which sells cooked food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Naku has requested a loan of UGX 2,000,000 (Ugandan Shillings) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock food and buy tables for the restaurant and will help Naku to generate greater profits and improve on the economic status of her family. Naku hopes that, in the future, she will be able to open up another restaurant. \r\n\r\nNaku is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like Naku, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

He is married and has three children, one of whom is currently in school. For the past three years, Siliman has been working hard to manage his welding shop, which does welding to make doors, gates, and windows. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Siliman has requested a loan of UGX 2,500,000 (Ugandan Shillings) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more material that will be used to make metal doors and windows and will help Siliman to generate greater profits and pay school fees for his child. Siliman hopes that, in the future, he will be able to start up another welding workshop. \r\n\r\nSiliman is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like Siliman, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1288835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal

She has a beautiful life with her husband, Marcial, who is also 26 years old. They are blessed with two children, Misael, who is 8, and Jarol, who is 2. They feel committed to developing and growing their family.\r\n\r\nThey live in a house made of quality materials. They used to sell meals at the grocery market in their area, but they opted to leave that business temporarily in order to give their little one, Jarol, all the attention he needs. This is when, along with Marcial, they chose to gather enough capital to form a small group of bricklayers and hired hands to build homes out of good materials.\r\n\r\nHaving a husband who has been working in this field for  20 years, the couple is well received among their neighbors, whom they provide services to, such as cementing and putting the finishing touches on walls with the help of their two nephews who used to be unemployed.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is pleased with the way things have been going since, up until now, things have gone well and they have had normal income to financially support their family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, they hope to also start construction on their own home with quality materials and to get an additional piece of land because they are thinking of their children's futures. This is their first loan through Kiva partner MFP. They are very grateful for the way the bank members have confidence in them.

His whole life he has devoted himself to what he knows best and knows how to do, farming and working with livestock.  Together with three of his six children, this man gets up very early in order to start his chores, which are milking his cows and taking care of his corn and bean crops.

She will use this loan to buy some young bulls.  \n\nShe plans to invest part of the proceeds from this loan to feed her livestock while the rest will be used to repair her house.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1286978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase young bulls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kulundu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-02-04T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-06T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bubuazipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":630}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":735,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":35126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458921},{"amount":735,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":35126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495480},{"amount":630,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":30108.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013930}],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T20:16:00Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T09:56:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":524219,"name":"Blanca Celsa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Blanca de 63 a\u00f1os de edad, es una guerrera que ha luchado por ofrecerle un bienestar a su familia.

However, Mamuka\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program provides business start-ups with credit.  The program extends soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products.  They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.  \n\nWith this loan, Mamuka will cover the costs of renovating the store where he will set up a grocery.  He will purchase basic groceries and sell them from his store. Mamuka hopes his business will be profitable and attract many customers from the local community. He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.

of 32. He is married and has two children. He and his family live in a village. The whole family works with crop production, and also with livestock breeding. They mainly grow onions, wheat and potatoes. However, Askar's main source of income is from fattening livestock. Every morning his wife milks the cow, which gives up to 10 liters of milk, which she sells to her neighbors and acquaintances. His wife also produces dairy products like yoghurt, cottage cheese and sour cream. \r\n\r\nDuring the season, Askar gets a good harvest and income from growing crops, but currently it is the season for fattening livestock and for income from this type of activity.

","en":"Elvira is 28 years old, she is married.  She and her husband are raising 3 children who are not school aged.  Elvira has a university economics education.  As an additional source of income for her family, Elvira started a grocery business.  Elvira owns a store \"Pineapple,\" which was started in 2011 with a sum of 200,000 som (KGS) and today brings in around 40,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of groceries.

He is married with two children, 3 years and 7 years old. One of his children is currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Mustapha established his provisions business. He began his business because he was a student, but he could not have money to further his education. Through his little savings from friends, he decided to start a business. He works at the business every day, from morning to night. He says that the main challenge to his business is the high cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nMustapha requires a loan in order to buy more cartons of mayonnaise, milk, sardines, and bag sugar. He hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow him to improve his living conditions and educate his children. In the future, Mustapha plans to open another shop. He thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1286538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Animal farming is her family's main source of income.  She started in this business with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS), which she used to buy two sheep.\r\n\r\nJarkynai's farming business is still not very big.

She has been working in the fish trade for over 20 years already. She is a member of a UIMCEC branch where she is requesting a new loan, having already repaid the previous one. Her aim is to use her loan to buy fish and seafood for resale. She goes to the harbour and gets fish and other seafood which she resells in her village. Her workday starts at 8 o'clock in the morning and finishes at 8 o'clock at night. She intends to increase the revenue generated by her business. This will enable her to better manage the water and electricity bills so that she can support her husband with the daily household expenditures. Her future aims consist of developing her business further, buying a canoe and a refrigerated truck, which will allow her to export her fish to outside markets.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1288844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish and seafood for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2013-02-05T10:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-07T10:50:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33334,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":34091.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356753504},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":34090.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364653262},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33332.99,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":34090.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373041601},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33334.01,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":34091.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381832267},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":34090.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390690636},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33332.98,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":34090.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399937445},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33334.02,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":34091.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410221089},{"amount":283.34,"local_amount":133332.63,"processed_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":136361.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449754058},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.37,"processed_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":34090.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459235208}],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T15:55:57Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:59:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":524283,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is 43 years old and is married to Silvestre, a father who works as a farmer in their village, while Erlinda is busy managing their hog raising business.

Due to her visionary and enterprising spirit within her, she has a loan request amounting to ksh.25000 to use for purchase of various farming supplies such as seeds, insecticides and fertilizers.

She is a fighter, who tries to face all the difficulties life presents, such as holding classes in an area far from her house.

This income is hardly enough to cover the family's food and everyday expenses. On several occasions, Marekh requested a loan from local financial institutions for starting a trading business, but she had no success. Her loan requests were always rejected because of her low income and lack of job experience, criteria usually demanded by the local credit providers. \r\n\r\n<p>Marekh's loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative through Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\n<p>Marekh will purchase stocks of clothes in Tbilisi (the capital city) for wholesale prices and resell them in her village for a profit. It will be hard work for Marekh, but according to her estimations, the business will be profitable and increase the family's income.

Liliana wants to increase her production capacity so that she can guarantee that her child gets an education, and that her parents can live a decent life.  \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Liliana is requesting a loan to buy raw materials (leather) and supplies to make her products.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1289480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy leather and glue","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-02-05T19:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-07T19:20:08Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liliana Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":71411},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":73385},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75413},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77498},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":79640},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81842},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":84104},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":86429},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":88818},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":91273},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":93797},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":96390}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":71424,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":73493.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098899},{"amount":533.94,"local_amount":928576,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":955482.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356518073}],"funded_date":"2013-02-05T23:59:51Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:22:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":524435,"name":"Mohamed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 28-year-old Mohamed from Waterloo, an eastern area in Freetown.

","en":"Nishonali is a young man.  He is married and has three children.  Nishonali raises livestock.  He has several cows and sheep.  In addition, he transports hay on his truck.  Raising livestock is his main source of income.  He purchases livestock at the market, fattens it for two to three months and sells it at the same market for more money.  He likes this business a lot and Nishonali earns a good income from this business.  Of course his wife supports and helps him.  While Nishonali raises livestock he does not want his children to follow in his footsteps and tries hard to set up good conditions for their studies.  His dream is to give his children an education so that in the future his children can have a profession and be a support for him in his old age.  In order to grow his business Nishonali plans to buy several more heads of livestock and he has turned to Kiva for this.  He is asking for a loan to increase his livestock count and to expand his business.  He hopes for your financial support and thanks you in advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1285845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-05T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-07T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nishonali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":494.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":505.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":494.1,"local_amount":494.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":494.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751924},{"amount":505.9,"local_amount":505.9,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":505.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390615998}],"funded_date":"2013-02-14T16:04:10Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sabina Holzman","image":36162}},{"id":524596,"name":"Luis Fernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cEn la vida existen momentos que se quedan para siempre en la memoria, recuerdos que tienen m\u00e1s valor que las piedras preciosas\u201d.

She hopes her economic situation will improve in order to guarantee a better quality of life for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1289487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to repair her food cart and to buy fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-02-05T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-07T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49988},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51369},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52789},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54249},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55748},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57289},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58873},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60500},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62173},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63891},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65658},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67473}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.38,"local_amount":46169,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":47211.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356518078},{"amount":60.38,"local_amount":105660,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":108046.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364552307},{"amount":30.97,"local_amount":54193,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":55416.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382164643},{"amount":31.98,"local_amount":55964,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":57227.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390981661},{"amount":67.16,"local_amount":117532,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":120186.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400821534},{"amount":34.58,"local_amount":60523,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":61889.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420094724},{"amount":148.55,"local_amount":259959,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":265830.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430073858}],"funded_date":"2013-02-12T08:39:17Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:43:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":524446,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca lives in Kakata Town, the capital City of Margibi County, which is the highest-producing rubber plantation in Liberia.

She insists that her family is the most important thing in her life and any sacrifice for them is well worth it.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1289486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-02-05T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-07T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24994},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25685},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26395},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27124},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27874},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28645},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29436},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30250},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31086},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31946},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32829},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33736}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13.72,"local_amount":24010,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":24552.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356518077},{"amount":15.6,"local_amount":27306,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":27922.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364552306},{"amount":31.72,"local_amount":55505,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":56758.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373514007},{"amount":16.36,"local_amount":28629,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":29275.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390981660},{"amount":16.93,"local_amount":29626,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":30295.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400821533},{"amount":17.36,"local_amount":30376,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":31062.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410806590},{"amount":17.82,"local_amount":31186,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":31890.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420094723},{"amount":37.14,"local_amount":65003,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":66471.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430073857},{"amount":19.29,"local_amount":33766,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34528.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009100},{"amount":14.06,"local_amount":24593,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":25148.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459522671}],"funded_date":"2013-02-05T20:49:25Z","paid_date":"2014-03-19T08:49:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":524447,"name":"Bulgamaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Bulgamaa is 42 years old and lives with her husband and son in a ger (traditional Mongolian housing) in the Arhangai province of Mongolia.
