He lives in a village in the Tskaltubo district with his mother and two children. Koba\u2019s wife lives and works abroad to help her family financially. Koba keeps busy running the family's small-scale agricultural business. He sows maize on the family-owned land and sells an average of 600 kg per year. Also, he runs a poultry farm with 40 hens and turkeys and sells them seasonally. Koba has requested credit for the purpose of building a greenhouse. The new business will be an additional source of income for the family, which will allow them to combat the poverty in which they live. Koba\u2019s loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program offers business start-up capital and re-startup credit with generous lending conditions to country rural poor, who often do not have access to credit as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Koba will purchase materials for the greenhouse construction (iron pillars and polyethylene covering) and will then construct the greenhouse, where tomatoes, cucumbers and greens will be grown throughout the year. Koba will work in the greenhouse himself. He will sell the harvested products at the local open market. The income of the family will significantly increase and they will be able to improve their living

He wants to buy seeds, manure, fertilizer, and pesticide.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that God and good-hearted people give him the help he's asking for so he'll be able to continue giving his family a good life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1289505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds, manure, fertilizer, and pesticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-02-05T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-07T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noe Humberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450361306}],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T18:58:17Z","paid_date":"2014-02-21T09:36:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":524519,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther, 44 years old, lives in Paynesville, one of the populated areas in Montserrado County.

He would like to invest in the purchase of quality wood and paints, and also to cover labor costs.\r\n\r\nSamuel has been selling through NOVICA since 2000. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I used to work as a messenger in a bank, but I realized I could do much better things with my life so I decided to go into arts, especially carving. I did not really undergo any actual training, but started carving bit by bit and sometimes sought help from my other colleagues. Sometimes I assisted them too.

get ahead. She, together with her husband and three children, has known how to work the land planting and cultivating corn, beans, and rice. In addition to working the land, she also has a small business selling dairy products. She makes these by purchasing milk and producing by-products, such as cheese curd and butter, on a small scale. She then sells these to her neighbors and friends. \r\n\r\nShe was not able to study as her parents had limited resources, however, she was able to complete the fourth grade in primary school. She is proud of the fact that she has some basics, which has helped her to be able to read and write. She is grateful to her parents for their efforts in addition to the work they did because she inherited it from them. They taught her how to work the land as well as methods for planting and cultivation and she has made a living farming for more than 20 years now. She has her own small plot of land, which is a result of her work and effort, together with her husband and family. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Rosa is requesting help to be able to buy seeds, fertilizers and for some mechanization to be able to continue working planting and cultivating corn, beans, and rice. This will allow her to continue helping her husband with the household expenses and other necessities that come up on a daily basis like clothing, school, medicine, and food, among others. Farming is the only means of support for her and her family. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to make her business grow, helping her husband to expand to other areas so that they can make a better income. This will allow them to give their children a better education, which is the greatest tool, and they can use it to get good jobs, have a better quality of life, and will be able to get ahead.

He gets everything he needs from his own garden and does not need to buy produce at the market.\r\n\r\nToji's only source of income is his animal husbandry business, and his earnings from this business are not bad.\r\n\r\nToji is planning to buy a few sheep.

With it, she will buy fabrics, runners, thread, fibers, foam, waterproof fabric and leathers. Her lingerie products are also useful in the market and fulfill her buyers; expectations of quality. That is why her main goals are oriented towards making her business grow, because a lot of customers ask her for items. However, her working capital is not enough to respond to her purposes of growth. Her goal for the future is it add better infrastructure with her machines. In the future, she wants to buy a house and have a vehicle to get around in and contact many more customers who will contribute to an increase in sales so she can make more day to day with a much better position in the changing market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1288908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabrics, runners, threads, fibers, foams, waterproof fabrics and leather.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-02-06T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-08T12:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":77924},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82309},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":84229},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":86194},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":88206},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90264},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":92370},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94525},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96731},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":98988},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":101298},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":106962}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.28,"local_amount":77924,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":78740.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498001},{"amount":46.76,"local_amount":82309,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83171.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527818},{"amount":47.86,"local_amount":84229,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85112.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928564},{"amount":48.97,"local_amount":86194,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":87097.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705714},{"amount":50.12,"local_amount":88206,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:45:04Z","rounded_local_amount":89130.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968003},{"amount":311.92,"local_amount":548981,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":554736.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817199},{"amount":75.09,"local_amount":132157,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":133542.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323474}],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T15:08:26Z","paid_date":"2013-10-22T08:43:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":524727,"name":"Diana Lissette","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Diana Lissette vive junto a su peque\u00f1a familia, ella posee una sala de belleza realiza cortes, planchados, maquillaje, entre otros siempre con estilo y a la vanguardia para que los clientes queden satisfechos, tiene varios a\u00f1os con el negocio y eso le ha regalado mucha experiencia en la venta que le permite obtener las mejores ganancias, su negocio esta ubicado en un lugar que califico que muy bueno para su actividad laboral, es muy conocido por las personas de la comunidad donde viven,  tiene mucha clientela y la prefieren por la calidad, los buenos  precios y sobre todo por  un buen servicio;

Her biggest challenge is sourcing for finances. The animals on the farm have been given the name Kitambaa.

This client was also asked what she learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session and she answered 'loaning process.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Florence replied that it will increase her income.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Florence owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, solar power, TV, DVD' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

His biggest challenges are diseases and high labour costs. The animals on the farm have been given the name Nyangira. He will use the loan of 40,000 KES to buy poultry birds.\r\n\r\nDouglas was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied that the interest rate is favourable. This client was also asked what he learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session and he answered: 'It brings cohesiveness hence to be able to learn about projects like keeping poultry.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Douglas replied 'by being able to send my children to a good school.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Douglas owns the following: 'cow, poultry, pump, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, solar power, TV, DVD' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Margaret replied 'Increase family income to meet basic needs.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Margaret owns the following: 'cow, poultry', but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household: 'mosquito net, electricity, TV, DVD', but does not have 'solar power, running water, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

They all live in the village of Noumou W\u00ear\u00ea in the S\u00e9gou region (4th administrative region of Mali) and got to know each other thanks to neighbourly and family relationships. They buy mortars and gourds which they engrave with nice slogans and motifs and resell. The members of the group decided to work together with Soro Yiriwaso in order to increase their business and are on their 14th group loan cycle.\n\nSafiatou (the woman standing on the far left of the photo) is well known in the village of Noumou W\u00ear\u00ea for her engraved mortars and gourds. She plans to use her loan to buy 80 gourds and 20 mortars from the markets in the surrounding villages of the S\u00e9gou region and at the M\u00e9dine market. The sales are made for cash or credit at home, on the streets and by request, to a client\u00e8le mostly made up of women. In order to do the engraving, needles are put in the fire for at least one hour, and when they are red hot they are taken out and used to create a nice design on the outside of the mortars or gourds, according to the customers' desires. Safiatou expects to make an average monthly profit of 25,000 francs with the help of this loan, which will be reinvested in her business and used to keep the household supplied with condiments.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1289847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy gourds and mortars.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-02-06T13:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-08T13:10:05Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamou       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wawa          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:58:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347180082},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922892},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636440},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029923},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819439},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678339}],"funded_date":"2013-02-07T06:52:50Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":524725,"name":"Regina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina is married to a farmer and they live happily in a rural community.

Now his wife also works as a driver at the same entity in another direction, between Ulaanbaatar and Baganuur, one of the nine districts of Ulaanbaatar but considered a separate city.\r\n\r\nThe house they live in is far away from the city center and they have difficulty accessing day-to-day activities such as shopping, transfer of cash and going to work, etc., so he is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to add to his savings for purchasing a house which is near to the city center. Over the past years he has accumulated a cash amount of 14,000,000 MNT and the price of his desired house is 18,000,000 MNT. As a result, the family can live in a strategically-located house where banks, shops and work places are easy to access.

Doricah owns the following: \"cow and poultry\" but does not own \"pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile.\" Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household \"mosquito net and TV\" but does not have \"electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine or DVD player.\"\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1289666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

They are, on average, 41 years old and have an average of four children each. They all live in the village of Noumou Were, in the region of S\u00e9gou (4th largest administrative region in Mali). They met one another through neighborhood, family, and marital ties. They buy and sell calabashes and mortars engraved with beautiful slogans and designs.\r\n\r\nThe group members decided to start working with Soro Yiriwaso in order to help strengthen their revenue-generating activities, and they are now on their 14th group-loan cycle.\r\n\r\nAminata (the woman standing on the far left in the photo) is a big seller of calabashes and engraved mortars in the village of Noumou Were. She plans to use her loan to buy 150 calabashes at the M\u00e9dine market from itinerant merchants from the surrounding villages in the S\u00e9gou region. She resells her goods for cash or for credit to a clientele made up mostly of women. She sells her goods from home, traveling from place to place, and she also takes orders. To make the engravings, she leaves needles in the fire for at least one hour, and when they are glowing red, she removes them and starts engraving beautiful designs on the exterior of the mortars and calabashes, according to the client's personal taste.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, Aminata expects to earn an average monthly profit of 25,000 FCFA, which she will use to reinvest in her business and provide condiments for her family. Her goal is to sustain her business through this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1289858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy calabashes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Noumou Were","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-02-06T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-08T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347180085},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922895},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636443},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029926},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819442},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50308.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678342}],"funded_date":"2013-02-07T16:37:30Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holden Ferry","image":null}},{"id":525003,"name":"Orlando Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Orlando, vive con su madre y una t\u00eda, en casa familiar, no tiene hijos, \u00e9l se dedica a la agricultura, aprendi\u00f3 desde peque\u00f1o con su padre, la agricultura y ganader\u00eda son los oficios que realiza.\n\u00c9l solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de materiales para poder realizar una siembra, el abono y los herbicidas ser\u00e1n los que comprara para poder dar inicio a su trabajo, esto le ayudara a terminar de realizar el proceso en el ma\u00edz, y tener una buena producci\u00f3n.\nSu aspiraci\u00f3n es a futuro tener una casa propia, en el terreno. \n","en":"Orlando lives with his mother and an aunt in the family house.

Her previous loan was a big help in her business and she was able to buy all the products she needed for her variety store. Her loan was also a big help in the education of her children and for providing for her family's everyday expenses. Celia's variety store has been running for three years now and continues to grow. Along with her husband, a businessman, she works hard to provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCelia is requesting another 40,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better as a greater variety will result in better profit. Celia will continue to use her business profits to help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and provide for her children\u2019s education. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Celia dreams of expanding her business as well as her husband's business.

She will use her loan to buy 10 mortars and 60 calebasses at the Medina market from fair-goers coming from villages surrounding Segou. \r\n\r\nShe sells from her home, door-to-door, and on order, for cash or credit, to a clientele consisting mainly of women. \r\n\r\nTo do the engraving, needles are placed in the fire for at least one hour until they turn red, and are then retrieved and used to make beautiful drawings on the outer surface of the calebasses or mortars based on the customer\u2019s requirements.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mrs. Sanata hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 17,500 FCFA, which she will use to reinvest in her activity and to ensure the supply of food and condiments for her household. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1289855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy calebasses and mortars.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Noumou Were","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-02-06T15:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-08T15:50:07Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa        Soucko         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou                               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":42259.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347180084},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":42259.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922894},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":42259.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636442},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42259.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029925},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":42259.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819441},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":42259.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678341}],"funded_date":"2013-02-07T23:49:07Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":524760,"name":"Sorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sorn is 41 years old.

The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salary Ekaterine earns working as a cook. Seasonally, the family sells the harvested nuts and maize that were grown on the family-owned land. It is hardly enough for the family to cover everyday expanses.  According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category. Ekaterine requested a loan from Credo to start a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up program loans money for business start-ups and \"re-startups.\" It provides access to credit with less rigid conditions for the country's rural poor, who usually do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, Ekaterine will purchase a milk cow. She will place it in the old, empty farm building located in their yard. Ekaterine will work hard on the farm. She will produce cheese and sell it in the village. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income.

their neighborhood where she sells her merchandise for cash and credit to a clientele made up essentially of women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she envisions making an average monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA which will be used to contribute to the family expenses, pay the interest on her loan and invest the rest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1289869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural

","en":"Muhamadi lives in the Pyandj region.  He is 51 years old.  He is married and has four children.  His sons work abroad.  Muhamadi has a technical high school education and worked as an accountant for several years.  Now he would like to test himself in the livestock business, because this is a profitable business.

She is a widow, a dynamic woman, ambitious, a self-taught entrepreneur, 48 years old, and mother to 7 children. She sells fish. Her husband died unexpectedly from a short illness. She started her business with a micro loan received from the MFI Hekima. However, she has just completed 9 loan cycles. During this period, this client saw her business regress following the growing insecurity in the supply zones, specifically in Rutshuru. This new loan must serve to supply her with 3 baskets of fish (salted, smoked or fresh). In addition, she hopes to see her children grow and to buy a house.

The family resides in their own house which was built last autumn. In June 2012 he began running newspaper, magazine and mobile phone sales, renting a shop at a trade center. \r\n\r\nCurrently his wife is operating this shop because in October 2012 he began purchasing heads and intestines of livestock from brokers and then cleaning and classifying them. In the end he sells them to customers and some outdoor markets. Also he uses some of them in his family's daily food. One time he said that by using livestock intestines in food, the family really decreased their food expenses significantly. Even though he has been running his intestine sales business for just three months, he has already attracted quite a number of clients. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in is incompletely built and in wintertime, it really loses its heat, and as a result the family gets chilled to their core. The house needs its roof to be covered with metal, walls to be insulated both from inside and outside, and floors to be molded. So Sainsanaa is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase metal, glass cotton, bricks and cement. As a result, the family will be able to live in a comfortable and warm place and most importantly, the house will preserve its energy and enable the family to burn less coal, thus contributing to the effort against air pollution.\r\n\r\nThe borrower is a very hardworking individual who greatly cares about his children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1289795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He lives in Khoni District, West Georgia, with his wife. His wife receives a retirement pension. George is leading his family's small-scale agricultural business. He runs a family-owned dairy farm, with two calves and a milk cow. George produces cheese and sells it in the village. In addition, he grows nuts and maize on the family-owned land, and he sells these crops seasonally. The income is not enough to provide George and his wife with normal living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGeorge has requested loans from local financial institutions several times, for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to restart his family business, which was stopped a couple of years ago because of financial problems. His loan request was approved, as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with fewer conditions, to the country's rural poor, for business start-ups and restart-ups. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low incomes, and they often do not have access to credit.\r\n\r\nWith the credit, George will purchase chickens to restart a poultry farm. He will place the chickens in a shed located in their yard. He will raise them and sell them for a higher price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She has a good understanding of her suppliers as well as her clientele which thanks to her experience in this business she has gathered over the years. However, she is constantly out of stock of certain products due to the fact that she has to sell all her goods in order to be able to buy more because she has so little capital.

As a business, she has had a bar-restaurant in a neighborhood of the town for approximately 1 year. She benefits from good experience in this field, but her capital does not allow her to satisfy all her clientele anymore, and they are sometimes obliged to go to the competition. This is because of her small capital.

Several years ago, she divorced her husband and is raising their three children on her own. She's forty years old and endures a harsh existence because her ex-husband pays no alimony and offers no assistance with their kids. Mahfirat's parents and loved ones try to help as much as possible; however, their help just isn't enough, for every year the children demand more and more resources. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Mahfirat decided to earn a living by starting a business. She went to courses offered by the \"Women's Business Association\" and received a certificate of completion. She learned a great deal and is confident in her ability to successfully lead a business. She wants to focus on profitably reselling women's and children's clothing. She plans to use future profits to obtain a good education for her children and supply them with healthy food. \r\n\r\nShe's asking for a loan of 1000 somoni in order to purchase her first inventory and start her business. Mahfirat is hoping for your help.

She plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school, invest in a cow, and, perhaps, invest in another business. \r\n\r\nDuring the 2013 Long Rains season, each group member will receive 0.5 acres of agricultural inputs, on credit.

Her family is her biggest motivation and the cornerstone of her existence.\r\nTwo years ago she decided to get started with her business idea. That's why she set up a small food stall located next to a construction site. There she makes breakfast and lunch, and sells snacks and refreshments to the construction workers and engineers.\r\nThanks to this business this woman provides food, housing and education for her three children.

enterprising woman who strives daily to give her family the best.  She married young and has a minor daughter who depends economically on her and her husband.  She was unable to go to school full-time for lack of economic resources so she was only able to finish fourth grade in elementary school.  She\u2019s a woman dedicated to agriculture and growing coffee, an activity she\u2019s been doing alongside her husband for more than 8 years.  Her parents were unable to provide education for her but they did teach her how to earn a living honorably, properly and responsibly.  Her brother-in-law sometimes helps with the crops when it\u2019s time to pick and harvest the coffee.  Her crops are located in the back of the same property where they live which makes caring for the crops daily easier.\r\n\r\nBlanca is currently asking for a loan to buy fertilizer and to pay to transport it to her house so she can earn extra income selling this product in the community where she lives while at the same time protecting her crops from the various infestations that can damage crops like coffee.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to fix her house and give her daughter what she was unable to have herself: a formal education including elementary, secondary and university so she\u2019ll have better employment opportunities, a better lifestyle and more economic solvency to cover expenses and other life necessities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1290275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and pay transportation costs.

He's married and has two children.  He lives with his parents, and hasn't yet had the opportunity to live independently with his family.  Firdavs is the driver of his own mini-bus, and transports passengers throughout the city.  His wife does not work outside the home, and spends her time raising the children.  Firdavs' work is hard; he begins working early in the morning and returns home late.  The family has additional income coming from his mother, who sells women's clothing at a market.  Firdavs wants to buy furniture for his home and a washing machine for his mother.  He has long wanted to furnish his home, and has saved money over time. To cover what he lacks, Firdavs has turned to Arvand for financial assistance.  He hopes to receive the amount he needs to carry out his plan.  He thanks you.

","en":"Indira is 30 years old, married and has four children.  According to her mother, the children and husband actively help with the business.  To provide an income for her family, Indira is involved in animal husbandry and farming.  Thanks to her hard work, the business allows her to bring in about 5,000 KGS per month, which serves the source for covering expenses for food and basic family needs.  In order to further develop her business, Indira requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase livestock headcount.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further expanding her business in order to able to build a large house for her family and a barn for the livestock.

She lives with her husband and children in the house that she inherited from her parents.  She confronts problems in a wise manner.  She does not own a machine for making bricks and tiles.  But that was not an impediment.  She rented one and in that way began to make bricks herself and with her husband's help, she makes bricks and tiles by the thousands over the course of a month.  She hopes to increase productivity over time and with experience and above all with capital.  She knows that she will be successful because she has success selling the thousands to businessmen that visit constantly.  In addition, she notes that she has agricultural fields where she plants alfalfa and that are also rented to ranchers that need feed for their animals.  Now she wants to buy the land where she makes the bricks and thus not have to rent it.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Western neighborhood\" and is with her 20th loan with MFP.  For this reason she is grateful for your support, by which she will reach her goals.  She also promises to repay her loan in a timely fashion.

This is the group Young Entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nCarmen Luz is one of the group members. She is 46, separated and has two grown children. She knits winter sweaters, scarves and hats. She started this business 6 years ago, learning from one of her friends who does it. On the weekends she sells drinks in a park near her house.

He is 31 years old, single and lives with his parents. His father is a pensioner and also works as a stone-mason. Zaza cultivates a family-owned plot of land, growing carrots, beets, onions and potatoes and selling them to vegetable retailers. In addition, the family has a calf and a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. The cheese is sold at the local open market. \r\n\r\nZaza has received a loan as part of a start-up program so that he can establish a new family business.

She plans to buy a pattern machine and a small A\/C unit and also to renew her work area.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor and thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients, and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about these borrowers has been altered for their protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi borrowers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6000,"image":{"id":1289950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to
