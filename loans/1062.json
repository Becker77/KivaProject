She lives in the Rusvati district with her husband and her daughter. \r\n\r\nLuiza has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nAccording to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLuiza requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. \r\nThe start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Luiza will start a dental clinic locally. She will purchase dental equipment and operative supplies to satisfy the professional needs of the dentists that will be working at her clinic. Luiza hopes her business will be profitable because of the price range and well qualified dentists. This will increase her income and her family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs, in order to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":1289953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dental","sector":"Health","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

The village is located outside the electric grid, next to an under way highway that will connect western Belize with eastern Guatemala. The couple has raised 11 children, the youngest of who is 15 and oldest 33. \n\nThe farm is truly a family business, as everybody is expected to help out when they can. Epiphania has been instrumental in growing and harvesting cacao. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to have a better product. Especially now that we can sell it wet, we just need to take care of the trees,\u201d says Santiago. The possibility of selling wet cacao at the farm gate has passed the burden of fermenting and drying from the farmers onto the buyers. \n\nA cacao farmer of seven years, Santiago started growing cacao inspired by the arrival of a new market in Toledo. Equipped with some seeds and bags for planting them from the local co-op, Santiago planted his cacao in the foothills of the Maya Mountains and has been successfully tending to them ever since. His favorite thing about cacao is that once it\u2019s producing, it is a secure and stable source of income. \u201cSaturday I harvest, Sunday I have the money. It\u2019s not like planting beans and corn, which takes six to eight months to harvest,\u201d says Santiago. For Santiago, the most challenging part of cacao is fermentation, because the beginning of cacao harvest coincides with the end of the rainy season. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to hire help with cleaning their 700 cacao trees as well as bagging 200 new seeds for a planned farm expansion. Once bagged, the seeds take about six months to grow to seedlings that can be transplanted into the ground as soon as it has at least four healthy leaves. The cleaning and bagging will require and create 64 hours of labor in the community. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1290221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To clean 700 cacao trees and expand farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Pueblo Viejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-07T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-09T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":47.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971163},{"amount":41.7,"local_amount":83.4,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":84.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751688},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":41.69,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":42.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993429},{"amount":20.82,"local_amount":41.64,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255598},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":41.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136439},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":41.7,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":42.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900656},{"amount":20.33,"local_amount":40.66,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":41.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088537},{"amount":18.38,"local_amount":36.74,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":37.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673276},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":42.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144102},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":42.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467959954},{"amount":20.81,"local_amount":41.63,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":42.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180741}],"funded_date":"2013-02-07T19:14:23Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T13:07:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":525028,"name":"Massah N.

She is an IDP and lives in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. Hasila raises cattle and has done this for the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nHasila usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months and then resells them for more profitable price at the livestock bazaar. Her monthly income is 120 AZN and this business is the only source of financial income for her family.

Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan and are also used to make fresh punch.\r\n\r\nRahman sells his crops in the Bilasuvar Settlement and sometimes in the bazaar. His monthly income is 120 AZN. His wife actively helps him to raise the crops.\r\nAs his products are in high demand, Rahman wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover market demand. For this purpose he applied for 2000 AZN. He will buy new garden tools, seeds and fertilizers. He has a long loan history with AqroInvest and has used this credit union more than five times, which proves he is a responsible person.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1290123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) who lives in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement with his wife and two children. He is farmer who has grown seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last five years. He chose this business because it is profitable and fresh crops are in high demand. People use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits serve every family's table in Azerbaijan. They are also used to make fresh punch.\r\n\r\nRashad sells his crop in the Bilasuvar central bazaar. His monthly income is 250 AZN.

Since then she has repaid all her loans and expanded her business.\r\n\r\nAfter her last loan, which she invested in her business, Luz realized the need to build her home. She had started building it on a plot of land she had but she could only build the walls. She talked to other members of her group and they recommended her for a housing loan to finish building the floor and the roof.\r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nLuz is the single mother of two children. She works and lives in a rural town. Luz will use this loan to buy wood, zinc, nails, cement and other construction materials to build her floor and a zinc roof. She thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity.

There's work in his village, but not enough for everyone.  Many travel to Russia to earn money, but Ilhomjon doesn't want to travel to a foreign country and tries to live and work in his homeland. Ilhomjon is trying to grow his business and he does everything possible to ensure that his family lives prosperously.

This is how he received an invitation from one of the members of the \u201cNi\u00f1o Jes\u00fas\u201d (Baby Jesus) community bank to begin to develop his dream. This will be Alfredo's first loan with MFP. He is grateful for the opportunity to progress, and promises to make his loan repayments on time. He also likes belonging to his bank, where everyone is united.\r\n\r\nAlfredo will invest the money in buying sheep to increase his flock.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1290764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep to increase his flock,","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-07T23:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-09T23:50:08Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfredo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":53.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":60.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":70.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.3},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.49,"local_amount":53.72,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-19T08:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":55.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123073},{"amount":23.1,"local_amount":57.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":59.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868898},{"amount":23.54,"local_amount":58.85,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":60.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577739},{"amount":24.3,"local_amount":60.76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":62.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529970},{"amount":25.31,"local_amount":63.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":65.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975001},{"amount":26.57,"local_amount":66.44,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":68.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996264},{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":68.44,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":70.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863791},{"amount":28.31,"local_amount":70.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":72.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352264}],"funded_date":"2013-02-10T23:34:13Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":525447,"name":"Bunvikane Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Dunia est une femme ambitieuse de l'association d'affaire Bunvikane.

Her husband has been working as a salesman for a company since 2007.  \r\n\r\nAntonia has a business washing and ironing clothes for families in her community.  She charges them $3.00 for a dozen pieces of clothing.  She has been doing this kind of work for more than 5 years.  Previously, she worked as a domestic.\r\n\r\nAntonia will invest this loan in a closet, which is something she doesn't have in her home, so that she can keep her garments neat.

He lives with his wife Julia, with whom he has six children, in a house they bought 20 years ago. His wife goes to their crops very early in the day, and although they no longer work together, they help each other constantly. Gerardo says that a little while ago he started working for a road construction company where he receives a monthly salary that helps with household expenses. For this reason, his wife took over the reins of the farming business, caring for their crops of corn, potatoes and other vegetables. They also have six cows that produce many liters of milk that they sell to cheese makers who come every afternoon. Now, Gerardo hopes to be able to increase his livestock because of the daily profits the animals produce. \"Farming is seasonal,\" says Gerardo, who helps out in the fields during his free time and on weekends.

education in the field of geology. He is 51 years old, married, and has raised 4 children, 3 of whom are now grown up and established in their own lives. For a long time, he has worked as the supervisor of public works of his hometown. He is well-regarded by his fellow citizens. As a means of supplementing his income, he began raising cattle. He started this business with just 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som and has worked hard to develop it to the point where it currently brings in a monthly income of 7,000 Som from the sale of cattle. For the further development of his business, Asanbek has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 Som (KGS) to buy two colts. In the future, he plans to expand the number of cattle he has for the purpose of increasing his profit from the sale of cattle. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1288714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase two horses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kok-Dobo village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-02-08T06:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-10T06:50:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asanbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":630,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":30136.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426789},{"amount":420,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20091.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552866}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T22:21:12Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":525284,"name":"Batbold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Batbold, 48 years old, lives with his daughter and mother in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

previous loan, Hurshed has decided to apply for a second loan, as the prior one allowed him to substantially expand his business of raising cattle. His wife and mother-in-law take care of the cows, and every morning they milk them and produce dairy products such as sour cream, ryazhenka (a type of yogurt drink), and cottage cheese, which they then sell at the market. This year Hurshed wants to build another cowshed for his cows because with each passing year, his herd gets larger and his current cowshed is not large enough to accommodate any future expansion. This business is bringing in a very good income for him. Hurshed wants to use this loan to buy building materials so he can build a new cowshed. He is very happy that he can receive the support of Kiva to realise his plans.

Her life has always been filled with great gifts, the best of which, she says, are having had her son and sharing her life with a great man.  Although her financial situation has never been the best, she has ample reasons to smile.  She loves her family and it is they who give her the strength to go on.  For more than 30 years, she has produced and sold clothing directly, producing household textiles and doing clothing alterations from her home and, thereby, providing for her family.  With her business she managed to provide an education and a better quality of life for her son.  Her greatest ambition is to enjoy each day in her beautiful home and not to have to worry about the trivialities of life.  She loves her work as a seamstress and, what is more, sewing is her great passion.  For this reason, she aims to capitalise on the new school term by applying for a loan to purchase fabric for making school uniforms.

the Southern highway.  The village is named Laguna because it houses a lagoon with various species of birds. He is currently living with his parents along with his older brother and younger sister. His dad recently passed his cacao farm onto Heraldo to instead focus on his annatto and ginger farm. \n\nBesides his cacao farm, Heraldo also grows other crops like bananas, plantains, coconuts, corn and other ground foods for home use. \u201cI like to drink a glass of cacao before going to the farm so that I can have energy to work,\u201d says Heraldo. He likes cacao farming because there is a good market for it. To protect his cacao and practice the sport, Heraldo goes out hunting cacao-eating animals. His favorite part of cacao farming is pruning, because he knows it\u2019s an investment to make his trees more productive in the upcoming season.\n\nHeraldo, who farms six acres, has a passion for cacao and spends most of his time on his farm on small tasks like removing suckers and infected pods. When referring to suckers, farmers mean excess branches on their cacao, which \u201csuck\u201d the plant\u2019s energy away from the fruit pods to the branches. At harvesting time the entire family pitches in to get the job done faster. Heraldo owns a horse and uses it to bring the wet beans home during peak season \u2013 March through May.  \n\nHeraldo is requesting a loan to hire people in the community to help him clean and prune his cacao farm and establish a nursery for his first expansion. Cleaning is the process of chopping the entire overgrown bush around the farm to improve air circulation through the plants. Pruning is the process of removing of nonproductive branches from the trees and is performed to improve yields.

","en":"Rustamjon is 38 years old, married, and has 4 children. He has worked in animal husbandry all his life because he did not study in his younger years and does not have an education. His wife is a homemaker who raises the children, but in her free time, she helps her husband feed the cattle. They live in a mountainous region where raising cattle is a good way of making a living and brings in a nice income. As this is their only source of earnings, they are trying to develop their business. In order to feed his family and improve his livelihood, Rustamjon plans to increase his herd and will use this loan to purchase cattle.

She lives with her husband, Gerardo.  They have six children, whom they are raising with great love and affection in the house they inherited ten years ago.\r\n\r\nShe is a very agile woman.  This is mostly because she always walks several kilometers in order to be able to milk their cows.  The cows are in a stable on the outskirts of her area.  She spends her whole day taking care of them.  They always give her an average of ten liters of milk, which she uses to make cheese molds.  This helps her to get daily income.\r\n\r\nShe also takes advantage of this time to take care of her potato, corn, and vegetable crops.  She harvests them with great satisfaction, and she sells them in the same place.  \u201cThe same merchants come in their trucks,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nShe feels at peace, and she has a lot of plans to improve her quality of life.  Her husband works for a road construction company, and he gets good income.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the La Rosa de Paltarumi communal bank, and this is her eighth loan with MFP.  She is very happy to be able to do her normal business activities because she has support from all of you.  She pledges to make all of her payments punctually.

He is married and has 4 children. He raises cattle at home. Recently, he hosted a very jubilant wedding for his son. He incurred substantial expenses, and sold 2 cows to pay for the wedding. Now he wants to build a house for the newlyweds, as it is too crowded for the whole family to live together.

She and her husband have been raising livestock for over 12 years. They now have 18 head of livestock which Sayora raises at home. She has a very good understanding of the nature of this business, and she knows when to buy and sell animals. She also has a dairy cow. Every day, she milks up to 10 litres of milk and sells it to her neighbours and acquaintances.

Maria Luisa tiene buenas referencias de pago y una moral intachable se siente agradecida con la ayuda, asegura que podr\u00e1 saldar la deuda y a la vez tiene la esperanza que llevara a su hogar seguridad econ\u00f3mica.","en":"Mar\u00eda Luisa lives together with her daughter, her nephew, and her mother in her own home. She sells clothing for women, gentlemen and children - shirts, pants, dresses, and skirts, among other items. She has been in business for several years and this has given her much experience which allows her to obtain the best profits. \r\n\r\nThe business is located in her home and she also sells as an itinerant saleswoman. She is very well-known by the people of the locale. She has acquired herself much clientele since everyone knows that what she sells is of quality, at accessible prices and with an unequaled service always to the order and available to the customers. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a committed woman, dedicated to her work and very much a go-getter. She strives day to day to the maximum in order to make herself a better life and a great success for the future. \r\n\r\nIn the last weeks the demand increased and she wants to make the most of it with a new investment, but she does not have enough capital that supports her since all her purchases are for cash. Because of this she is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL which allows her to buy clothing wholesale. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Luisa has good payment references and an irreproachable moral. She feels grateful for the support, sure that she will be able to settle the debt and at the same time has the hope that she will bring economic security to her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1290812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

cuesti\u00f3n de bajos recursos econ\u00f3micos en su hogar, alcanz\u00f3 a terminar la escuela primaria sin oportunidad de llegar a ser bachiller y mucho menos profesional, vi\u00e9ndose frustrados muchos de sus sue\u00f1os. Vive en el cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra. Sandra reside en la Parroquia Puerto Lim\u00f3n de este cant\u00f3n, un sector que fue habitado por una comunidad ts\u00e1chila hace muchos a\u00f1os y tiene varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos. Adem\u00e1s los habitantes de esta parroquia en su gran mayor\u00eda, se dedican a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda.\nSandra siendo muy peque\u00f1a ayudaba a sus padres a criar pollos y gallinas para la posterior venta, terminando la escuela se dedicaba a ayudar a su madre en los quehaceres del hogar y tambi\u00e9n a cuidar a los animales. Con este aprendizaje, Sandra hace 2 a\u00f1os empez\u00f3 el negocio por s\u00ed sola y tambi\u00e9n atiende un local de venta de balanceado en un peque\u00f1o espacio de su casa. Dedica a este negocio 8 horas cada d\u00eda. Sandra siempre ha tenido objetivos y metas altos, es por eso que ella ahora necesita ampliar su negocio de venta de balanceado y crianza de pollos, acudiendo de alguna forma a la herramienta de publicidad y as\u00ed incrementar sus ingresos y tener realizaci\u00f3n personal. Es por esto que solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar los insumos que sean necesarios.

She is single and has no children. Due to poor economic resources at home she was only able to finish elementary school without the opportunity to graduate from high school and even less to get a professional degree leaving her frustrated because she has not accomplished many of her dreams. \r\n\r\nShe lives in the district of Santo Domingo in the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province. \r\nSanto Domingo connects the Ecuadorian mountain region with the coastal region. It is a city which has turned into the commerical axis with several growing sectors. As proof it has several entrepreneurial families that a few years ago started with small businesses. Studies show that a majoriity of the businesses started empirically and have grown due to tourists, business people and travelers moving from one region to the other. \r\n\r\nSandra lives in the Puerto Lim\u00f3n parish in this district. This sector was inhabited by a Ts\u00e1chila community many years ago and has several tourist attractions. Also, a majority of the inhabitants of this parish work in agriculture and livestock.  \r\n\r\nSince she was very little Sandra helped her parents to raise chickens and hens for sale. After school she would help her mother with chores around the house as well as taking care of the animals. \r\n\r\nWith this training Sandra started her own business two years ago. She also takes care of a small feed selling business out of her home. She spends eight hours a day on this business. \r\n\r\nSandra has always had high expectations and goals. This is why she now wants to expand her feed and chicken raising business. She wants to use some form of advertisement and in this way increase her income and gain personal fulfillment. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to buy the necessary supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFundaci\u00f3n Alternativa gave her the attention that she needed and has not been able to get before. \r\n\r\nSandra is thankful for everyone around the world who is helping her dreams come true.

Nino requested loans from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural start-up business, but with no success. Her loan request was rejected each time due to low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nThe income for the family comes from an animal husbandry business. Specifically, they own pigs and sell the pork and piglets seasonally. As well, Nino\u2019s husband transports wood from the forest that he sells to the villagers, but their income is hardly enough to feed a three-member family. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo to start up a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides for business start-ups and re-startups.

agriculture. He keeps two cows, gets milk and uses it in cheese production. Then he sells the cheese in a local market and gets income which helps him to cover his family's basic costs.

She and her young daughter, Veronica, live with her parents in the house where she grew up.  She owns a sewing business that is now her main source of income.  Her parents taught her to sew when she was growing up, tailoring having been something of a family business.  Elizabeth started the business 3 years ago and quickly managed to buy an industrial-scale sewing machine of her own.  She mostly makes traditional skirts.  \"I make most of my income from hand-embroidering skirts . . . they take a month to make and I earn an average of one-thousand soles per skirt\", she says.  The Festival of Santiago (patron saint of animals) starts soon and Elizabeth expects many orders for skirts because local women want them for dances scheduled during the festival.

She grew up in the \"departamento\" of Leon in western Nicaragua.  In her spare time, she likes to cook for her family.  She makes traditional food: gallo pinto, nacatamales and other dishes common to this region.  Unfortunately, she had to leave school early because her family didn't have enough money for her to continue.  She had to go to work at a young age, instead, to help with family expenses.  Thanks to a strong spirit and a drive to get ahead, she was able to start her own pork-sales business.  She operates the business from her house and is especially busy on weekends when there's the most demand for her products from customers who buy what she sells to make nacatamales, chicharron, yucca, moronga, carde cerdo, chancho frito, chicharon blanco and other pork-based dishes.

As part of the focal point of Germ\u00e1n Busch, it is made up of 10 members and is directed by a board where Primitiva is the President. The members of the community association are involved in various businesses including: selling cosmetics, corner store, selling toys, selling juice, selling natural medicine, hat shop, selling gifts, making sweaters.\r\n\r\nThe loan will benefit small businesses, of which Primitiva is a member. She joined Pro Mujer two years ago at the invitation of a friend who is a member of the institution. Today she has a business selling hats; she tells us that she launched her business after years of working for her brother, who had the business, then afterwards decided to open her own workspace.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe loan is to increase capital (to buy leather) that she will acquire from Sucre and later, after she crafts them, she will sell the hats at the fair at the Peru-Bolivia border. This type of work allows her to generate the resources to support her family, as she is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says that she likes the health and credit training and the consulting offices."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5825,"image":{"id":1290889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy leather.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-02-08T23:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-10T23:00:10Z","loan_amount":5825,"lender_count":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Primitiva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilma\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina Antonia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nathalie Estrella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":40101.53,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3288.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.51},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.51},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4088.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":593.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1071.85,"local_amount":7379,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":7406.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914394},{"amount":1188.34,"local_amount":8181.02,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8211.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625382},{"amount":1188.35,"local_amount":8181.02,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8211.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021339},{"amount":1188.34,"local_amount":8181.02,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":8211.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809147},{"amount":1188.12,"local_amount":8179.47,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8209.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669217}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T16:05:51Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:17:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"LeeJay Victor","image":null}},{"id":525602,"name":"Florenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florenda is married with three children.
