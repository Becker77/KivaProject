capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. He has been working as an engineer in the dismantling division of a construction business. From December to February, construction work stops which leaves him without a job. The company pays him a very small amount of money. His salary is the only source of family income because his wife is unemployed and stays at home. He has begun building a house with two flats. The new house is conjoined with the small house they live in. Due to a lack of finances, some interior decorations and the heating system isn\u2019t completely finished. He is requesting a loan of 1500000 MNT to purchase construction materials such as gypsum, paint, nails and cement. He would also like to install the heating system. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable and warm place and burn less coal thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

the Syunik province of Armenia.  He is not married and lives with his father.\r\n\r\nHe has been involved in agriculture and animal husbandry since his youth.  In 2009 he got his own farm in the village of Ujanis.  He currently owns some cattle, chickens and pigs.  His father helps him to take care of the garden where they grow fruits and vegetables.  Emil also owns a parcel of land where he cultivates only grain crops.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year, he sells meat, milk, cheese, eggs, fruits and vegetables at the wholesale markets of the Syunik province.  Emil works hard of course but, as he says, having his own farm is very profitable.  He takes pride in the fact that, thanks to his hard work, he is able to adequately provide for his family.\r\n\r\nHe needs a loan of 300,000 Armenian dram to get ready for the spring planting season and to buy barley seeds.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1291531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to organize spring planting and buy barley seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2013-02-09T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-11T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":12810},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":14840},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15650},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15500},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15610},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":16120},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":16140},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":16360},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":16660},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":16880},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":17040},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":17270},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17650},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":17710},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":18050},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":18230},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18480},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.03,"local_amount":12810,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":13002.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355901746},{"amount":37.1,"local_amount":14840,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":15062.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364613384},{"amount":39.12,"local_amount":15660,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":15895.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373009585},{"amount":38.75,"local_amount":15510,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":15743,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381795354},{"amount":603,"local_amount":241180,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":244803.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390658160}],"funded_date":"2013-02-22T14:17:57Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:10:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":525635,"name":"Presentacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Presentacion works hard to support her family.

The group consists of six members, and it has a board of directors with Nora as president. The members make a living through a variety of businesses, like selling cocoa, sewing, knitting, selling skirts, selling plants and being a construction assistant. The loan will help these small-businesswomen. This is the first loan for Nora, who was invited to join by a fellow member of the institution. She currently has a business sewing sweatshirts, which she learned from watching her mother and then established her own work space. She plans to use the loan to increase her capital and purchase fabrics at the trade fairs in the city of La Paz, and to use them to sew her products to sell at her sales post.

Here lives Lucia, a 45-year-old mother of eight children whom she loves very much and for whom she fights tirelessly alongside her husband to offer a decent life with a lot of love and affection. Lucia learned to work from a very young age because her parents had few resources, so she only has a sixth-grade education, but she would love to be able to finish school. Day to day, Lucia works in her small business baking and selling bread. She gets up very early to bake the bread to be ready to sell to her customers, mostly around school time. She believes she is making headway with her business because she is responsible and has a strong desire to keep moving forward. Lucia is very happy and grateful for Kiva lenders, because thanks to your support she will be able to improve her home by putting down flooring and painting walls, among other things. In this way she can improve her quality of life, have more security and be able to keep fighting to realize her biggest dream: expanding her bakery and being able to offer more products.

nine children. Her children are all adults and have finished their schooling. Sabina has been in farming for the past forty years, producing vegetables and milk that she sells at the local market in her area.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 30,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) loan from Juhudi Kilimo, which she will use to purchase water tanks for irrigation to help her water her crops and provide her with higher yields.

For the past two years, Winnie has been working hard to manage her coffee business, selling coffee seeds. \n\nTo help expand her business, Winnie has requested a loan of 1,000,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more coffee to increase sales, and will help Winnie to generate greater profits and provide for the basic needs of her family.

For the past four years, Farida has been working hard to manage her spare parts business, which sells motorcycle spare parts.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Farida has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more spare parts to sell, and will help Farida to generate greater profits and have a constant supply. Farida hopes that in the future she will be able to be self-reliant . \r\n\r\nFarida is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

In the morning time she serves breakfasts, such as fruit juices and sandwiches, and in the evening time grilled food. Her two nieces help her with all her work. They work for her serving customers. She has been doing this kind of work for at least 10 years. Sometimes her children help her out. She started out serving breakfasts only, but over time she has constantly increased the variety of the dishes she serves.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work. She loves cooking and always aims to offer her customers the best. Her future plan is to extend her business premises in order to sell carbonated drinks as the high temperatures the city experiences make this another good option to increase the earnings of the business.

She is in business attending to a grocery store for 10 years.\r\n\r\nShe started her business using capital she obtained from her severance pay from a tobacco factory where she used to work as a laborer. She needed to quickly obtain earnings in order to be able to pay school fees for her children and to contribute to the household expenses, so she opened a small grocery store which has been progressing little by little.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for financing in order to buy school supplies such as notebooks, journals, erasers, colored pencils, rulers, bags, ball-point pens, and markers. So, her idea is to offer various articles but not only the commonplace items of other grocery stores but to offer a variety to attract more customers. Her goal for the future is to open a convenience store offering household items."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1291555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy notebooks, journals, erasers, colored pencils, rulers, bags, ball-point pens, and markers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-02-09T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-11T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores Del Carmen \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":417,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.63,"local_amount":47.71,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":48.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118728},{"amount":47.95,"local_amount":47.05,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":47.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531366},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":46.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":47.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573312},{"amount":47.3,"local_amount":46.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":47.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373165996},{"amount":47.67,"local_amount":46.77,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":47.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971810},{"amount":45.47,"local_amount":44.61,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":45.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837183},{"amount":50.17,"local_amount":49.23,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860473},{"amount":48.43,"local_amount":47.52,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":48.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349177},{"amount":42.16,"local_amount":41.37,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:50:42Z","rounded_local_amount":42.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901348}],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T17:17:01Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:50:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":525945,"name":"Santiago Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cSANTIAGO\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el segundo ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Copacabana, est\u00e1 compuesta por diez integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Mary es la Presidenta.

This is the Santa Ana de los Olivos group. This group is beginning its second cycle. Nora is 59 years old and is one of the partners in the group, serving as president. She has an adult son that lives with her. Nora has a sewing workshop where she makes a living by making clothing and selling haberdashery. She works 10 hours a day, and began working when she was very young, studying and improving her sewing. She has been working in this function for 10 years and it is going well because she has a lot of clients that always come to her business for sewing, clothing, and to get their clothing tailored. Nora is happy because her work has allowed her to help her son and give him an education. In the future she hopes to own a place where she can have her workshop, as for now she is renting the space where she works. Thanks to her loans she is emerging. Her new loan will be destined for buying fabric, thread and sewing materials.\r\n\r\nNora wants to thanks the Kiva investors for allowing her loan and that of her communal group.

Pero le hubiera gustado mucho ser m\u00e9dico.\nGracias a su esp\u00edritu y sus ganas de salir adelante es que tiene por actividad econ\u00f3mica la venta mercader\u00eda en general la cual consisten en vender pantalones, camisas, camisetas, short, vestidos, pijamas, ropa de cama, juegos de toallas, prendas de plata y oro, cosm\u00e9ticos. Desde hace 12 anos que desempe\u00f1a dicha actividad, de forma ambulante y en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n. Su rutina de trabajo es unas 9 horas diarias, recorriendo las calles de su localidad, con un bulto de unos 20 kg ofreciendo sus productos. El objetivo del cr\u00e9dito es invertir en capital de trabajo y surtir su negocio en la compra de mercader\u00eda, para que en un futuro no muy lejano poder obtener mejores ingresos. Zenelia Elvira agradece la ayuda de los inversionistas kiva a personas de escasos recursos y pa\u00edses pobre econ\u00f3micamente como es Nicaragua para tener un medio de trabajo digno.\n","en":"Zenelia Elvira, 47 years old, is married with grown children. She is originally from Leon, a place that is located in the western part of the country. In her free time, she likes to go to the movies. Sadly, she was unable to pursue an educational career for lack of economic resources, which meant that she had to work from a very young age. She would have liked to have been a doctor.\r\n\r\nThanks to her spirit and her will to succeed, she earns a living through the sale of general merchandise, such as pants, shirts, blouses, shorts, jackets, pajamas, bedclothes, sets of towels, gold and silver jewelry, and makeup. She has been doing this activity for 12 years, going door-to-door and also selling out of her house. Her routine is to work some nine hours per day, walking the streets of her area with a bag of 20kg worth of her products. The purpose of the loan is to invest in working capital and grow the business through the purchase of merchandise, so that in the not-so-distant future she will have a better income. Zenelia Elvira is thankful for the help of the Kiva lenders who provide people with resources in poor countries such as Nicaragua so that they can earn a dignified living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1291576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He grows early vegetables, tomatoes, and radishes. He owns a large plot of land, where he maintains three large greenhouses and two other greenhouses for transplanting. \r\n\r\nThanks to his previous Kiva loan, Vasiliy was well prepared for his season and made a good profit. He invested a part of the profit in his business by purchasing a boiler for heating his greenhouse.

Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from their agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, whose milk is used in dairy products. In addition, they have 50 sheep and sell lambs locally. Liana also works as a pharmacist at local chemistry shop, but her income is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLiana requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to the country rural poor, who  do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Liana will start up her own pharmacy.

He is married and has five children who stay with him.  Out of the five children, three are school-going.  He is also looking after one orphan at home.\r\n\r\nElisha is involved in the buying and selling of agricultural products, mainly coffee, ground nuts and beans, as a major source of income to look after the family.  He started this business in 2008 after failing to get formal employment.\r\n\r\nElisha requested a loan of 2,000,000 shillings to add into his agricultural trade business to buy ground nuts, coffee and beans, since the season is on.

She is in a relationship, and she is the mother of two children between the ages of 6 and 10 who are under her care. They are currently attending primary school. She is a farmer by trade who grows corn. She began this activity at a very young age, helping her parents in the fields, gradually acquiring experience and knowledge in the trade. After becoming independent, she began to work in the cultivation of bulk grains because she saw the necessity of generating an income for her family. In her business, she receives support from her partner who helps her to sell her products in the same community. She would like her products to be sold in other places where they pay a better price. \r\n\r\nHer expectation is to continue working in her business, although her only difficulty is that some harvests do not go very well and they create losses for the family. However, this is not stopping her from maintaining her business since it is something that she likes to do, and through which she has been able to get ahead. She is requesting this loan to buy animals such as cows. She estimates that with cows, she will be able to sell milk and curds. This way she will be able to yield better earnings to provide maintenance for her lands for harvesting. Her goal is to obtain a better production and better quality of her products to sell them at a better price. Her future plan is to buy around 9 acres of land to continue cultivating so as to get a better income for her family to be able to provide her children with a better education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1291764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animals such as cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-02-10T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-12T03:10:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda Del Carmen \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":330.27,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":165.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":165.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175.22,"local_amount":165.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":175.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349179},{"amount":174.78,"local_amount":164.93,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":174.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440022319}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T09:04:34Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:49:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeremy Orloski","image":null}},{"id":525933,"name":"Granush","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Granush invested all of her loan money to purchase seeds for sowing, coal for heating, and fertilizers.

still below 15 years of age. He lives with his family in a seven-room apartment in Bamenda, northwest region of Cameroon. \r\n\r\nHe has encountered some major challenges in life such as the death of his uncle, being unable to sponsor his children in school and being unable to raise business capital. All these made life difficult for him. But now he has got a little bit of relief thanks to GHAPE. He came to know about GHAPE in 2009 after a long struggle to try and catch up with life.\r\n\r\nHe plans to invest his loan in the purchase electrical cables and in the production and sale of electrical appliances like distributors and switches. He is convinced the business will succeed because of the experience he has in this kind of business and also because he has a good business location. \r\n\r\nHe plans to use the profit from his loan to pay tuition fees for his children and to improve the standard of living in his family. Most of the profit from the business will be plowed back into  to the business.\r\n\r\nHe prefers to receive a loan from GHAPE because the method of repayment is comfortable and

She also takes care of additional family members, her elderly parents. She has a business which sells used clothing. Ruth has been in this business for 4 years. She applied for a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy more bales of used clothes to sell. She works six days a week at the market and sells on a retail-only basis.

Also she has good experience in business and has a good business location. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use the profit from the business to pay for her children\u2019s school fees, assist her younger brother to pay his apprentice fee, give good medication to her children whenever they are sick and also to ensure they are well fed. \r\n  \r\nShe prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because the rate of interest is low, the method of payment is comfortable and convenient and also because of the training GHAPE offers before disbursing her loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1291695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for palm oil, plantains, corn and seedlings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

Moses' dream is to expand his business to a level where he will not have to keep borrowing.\r\n\r\nMoses however has a challenge of bad weather which at times makes transport difficult, prices for agricultural products also fluctuate and sometimes he can not predict how much profits he will get."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1291693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, Irish potatoes and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kagadi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-02-10T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-12T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":187500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":190791.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589795},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":190791.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993755},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":190791.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040460},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":190791.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831089},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":190791.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689324},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":190791.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480467},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":190791.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879661},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":190791.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983359}],"funded_date":"2013-02-12T11:53:06Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T21:12:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":525990,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to Patricia. It literally launched her career as an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 years ago, her boss at a San Antonio catering company fired her when she questioned him on a price quote for a high school graduation party.\r\n\r\nHe quoted the client $5,500 and the client could only afford a maximum of $5,000. He refused to budge on the price and the client took her business elsewhere. When Patricia challenged his decision, he fired her on the spot.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the caterer also lost a lucrative wedding contract because the bride found out that Patricia had been fired. She decided to hire Patricia on her own. Later, the bride\u2019s sister did the same thing, and not just for their weddings, but also for their eventual baby showers.\r\n\r\nThus \u2013 with a bit of drama \u2013 San Antonio Rentals & Party Planning was born.\r\n\r\nPatricia\u2019s business creates nearly any kind of event in her hometown of San Antonio and the surrounding area. Her business offers event planning, full-service catering, floristry, and complete beverage services. It also provides a wide variety of rentals: centerpieces, photo booths, margarita machines, place settings and stemware, round or rectangular tables, chairs, tents, dramatic lighting, linens and fountains of dark, milk or white chocolate, ranch or barbeque sauce, cheese, or salsas.\r\n\r\nPrevious to working at a catering business, Patricia worked as an event coordinator for hotels and a major airline, and when others saw her work, they began to ask for her help creating events within their budgets, and she did it with an economical eye.\r\n\r\nAbundant creativity sets San Antonio Rentals & Party Planning apart. \u201cIf I have a box, I\u2019ll decorate it and no one would know it is a box,\u201d she says.  Because of her excellent reputation, Patricia enjoys a large number of repeat clients who also send her referrals. She says, \u201cThey enjoy the extra that we do for them.\u201d\r\n\r\nBesides herself, Patricia employs her husband and three full-time workers. On larger projects, she contracts others to help.\r\n\r\nIn order to purchase new equipment, china, dishware and utensils, Patricia returned to Accion Texas, Inc. for a loan. This is her third loan from Accion; her first was in 2011 after her father \u2013 a former Accion client \u2013 referred her to the nonprofit micro-lender. With each loan, Patricia purchases new inventory to improve sales. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf anyone has the opportunity to borrow money, I would highly recommend Accion for a start,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nFeel free to check out Patricia\u2019s websites to learn more about her event planning services (sapartyplanning.com), catering (endlesstaste.com), and fountains

Ibrahim has two years of experience in this field, which makes him considered a knowledgeable and skilled person.\r\n\r\nThe food products he sells are very popular among people, and are in high demand. His monthly profit from selling foods is 170 AZN. He is a very successful entrepreneur because of his good location in the central bazaar of his home city. His father helps to purchase wholesale products. \r\n\r\nThe profit he gains is not enough to reinvest in the business, and covering customers` demand is suffering for this reason. Being a main source of income, his profit is used for family needs. Ibrahim would like to increase his sales and invest additional capital. For this purpose, he applied for 1800 AZN. He will increase and diversify his foodstuffs. \r\n\r\nThis will be his second loan, and he has a good credit

Su madre inici\u00f3 haciendo cursos en el SENA-Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje \u2013 centros de educaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica y tecnol\u00f3gica, apoyado por estado Nacional, donde aprendi\u00f3 el arte de la marroquiner\u00eda y posteriormente trasmiti\u00f3 a sus hijos el aprendizaje y desde ese momento Kricia no ha dejado de aprender hasta lograr equiparar a su madre. Ella con su negocio paga sus estudios universitarios en Qu\u00edmica y Farmacia y simult\u00e1neamente trabaja en su taller. En sus tareas productivas Kricia trabaja artesanalmente, todas las operaciones del proceso: toma las medidas para tallar, dibuja el modelo, lo desmolda sobre cartulina, rectifica medidas, hace ajustes, saca el molde que corta sobre el material hila, hace el doblado de piezas y pega sobre el forro para finalmente hacer la costura y montaje de capellada en la cual termina el calzado sobre la planta.

She is 21 years old, and began working in this trade when she was 19 alongside her mother and siblings. Her mother had been taking government sponsored courses at the SENA - National Learning Service - in technology and technical education, and she encouraged her children to start up small businesses. Kricia's mother taught her some of the leather-working techniques she had learned in her courses, and Kricia learned very quickly.\r\n\r\nKricia leverages the income she generates from her business to cover her university education in chemistry and pharmacology. When designing and making her shoes, Kricia makes sure her creativity and personal touch are present throughout the entire process: she takes a client\u2019s foot measurements, draws out a model design, stretches and manipulates fabric over a cardboard shoe sole, makes corrections and adjustments to fabric and sizing, takes a mold for the sole, cuts out the sole from the desired material, folds, glues and sews key parts together, and finally mounts the upper portion of the shoe onto the desired sole.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to improve and expand her business gradually, and to finish her university degree so that she can begin a career as a pharmacist and have two sources of income. Kricia plans to use the support from this loan to purchase shoe soles, accessories, material and brooches for responding to an order from a client on the island of San Andr\u00e9s. Kricia enjoys a customer base of people who know her for her quality work, and she wants to expand on that base to increase her clientele and begin designing and selling purses and bags in local supermarkets and other locations in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1290937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to
