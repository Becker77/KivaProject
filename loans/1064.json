After completing secondary school, he enrolled into the Kapan Technical College for Building Construction Technology. At present he works as a construction worker for a construction company in Kapan. Lernik is married and has one son and one daughter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to working in construction, Lernik raises animals and grows produce in his native village, where he owns a land plot. He has been in this business for almost 20 years. On his farm, he keeps cattle, pigs, chickens, and sheep.\r\n\r\nOf course, after hard work in construction, it is difficult to take care of the farm as well, and so Lernik\u2019s wife and children help him out with farm work. Lernik and his wife sell vegetables, fruits, milk, meat products and cheese at the Kapan markets all year round. The revenues from farming allow him to provide for his family in a dignified way. Lernik decided to expand his farm, for which he needs a loan in the amount of 700,000 AMD to buy two bulls as well as hay for his cattle.

She is married to Marvin, a pedicab driver, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDanilyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

Today, he\u2019s asking for a youth loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l to buy added mechanic's tools for his business in order to respond rapidly to his clients\u2019 problems. He believes that acting properly is really essential to attract added customers. In the future, he\u2019s planning to enlarge his garage and receive more clients.

He lives with his wife and three school-aged children at their modest house located in one of the beautiful Lebanese villages. Fadi has spent the last sixteen years installing home electricity. He\u2019s the only one covering the family expenses. \r\n\r\nFadi always wanted to better develop his business and improve his work, but till now he earns a barely fair income, for that reason he decided to take a loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l to purchase the needed electrical equipment for his business.

She and her husband continuously working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 10,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of their jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMary hopes that the lives of her family will be better and dreams that her business will continue to grow. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She and her husband have two wonderful children. Baktygul has a high education and has a very happy and cheerful, positive personality. Since 1990 she has been doing animal husbandry and field crop cultivation, a business which she started with 20,000 KGS by buying one cow. Additionally Baktygul sometimes brings in clothing from Bishkek and sells to the stores. Thanks to her hard work Baktygul now has two milk cows, two calves and two horses in her livestock. Her monthly income from animal husbandry is 10,000 KGS. With the goal to grow her business she has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow and fodder. By that she can increase her income from the dairy business. Baktygul plans to invest the income from the loan into further increase of the headcount of livestock and build a house for her

Sauce is characterized as an area that produces milk and dairy products, cheese, curd, and buttermilk.\r\n\r\nIn her free time, she likes to cook traditional foods for her children.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources, she was not able to go to college, though she would have liked very much to be a veterinarian.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts and her desire to get ahead, she has as her economic activity a sales business of gold-plated jewelry and cosmetics, such as blush, compacts, eye shadow, eye pencils, lip pencils, body cream and perfumes.

They live in a wood house that she and her husband built together.  \r\n\r\nAt first, she worked selling food in her local wholesale food market but unfortunately had to leave this work due to health issues and decided to prioritize the family business they have: a motorcycle, mototaxi and motorcycle cargo repair service.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in the auto repair business for five years but her job is managing and seeing to the small spare parts business she has while her husband is in charge of the technical service.

Breads and spreads are staples in the usual Filipino cuisine, and are used mostly for breakfast and snacks. The most popular type of bread is the Pandesal, a Filipino version of the Spanish Pan de Sal or salted bread. It is baked during the wee hours of the morning and sold steaming hot to early commuters, students and workers. Her store is located adjacent to her house, and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales everyday.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 35,000 loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. She will also use the money for the maintenance of her oven. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. <p>\r\n\r\nLilibeth dreams that her business will expand even more and hopes to have a good and happy family.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<p>\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She works seven days a week and sells at both retail and wholesale levels.  She generates additional income through selling charcoal. Her major business challenges include transportation and defaulters.\r\n\r\nMary and her husband have three children, all of whom attend school.

She is divorced and has 2 children, ages 10 and 3. They live together in her house. Isabel's work consists in selling meals on weekends. On Saturdays and Sundays, she heads out along the path to prepare her grille, seasons her chicken, and begins to grille it, awaiting her customers. Then, Monday through Friday, she works at a soda fountain. She has kept up this rhythm of work for more than 5 years, having added the grilled chicken sales some months ago. At the outset, this proved a little complicated for Isabel, but with the passage of time, she came to master the rhythm and, now, she has no fear of going out to sell.\r\n \r\nIsabel enjoys her work very much. She has time for her children and, besides, has a good income, since, as noted, she has 2 activities, thus doubling her income. Isabel has lots of plans in mind; she would like to have her own business, but for now, she just wishes to install a soda fountain and thus, no longer depend on anyone else to generate her income. For the moment, she has decided to raise chickens, so she won't have to buy them somewhere else.  This would be more convenient. That's why Isabel is soliciting her 1st loan through MFP, and she hope the collaboration will continue in the future as she works towards her objectives.\r\n\r\nWith the borrowed 800 sols, Isabel will purchase chicks to raise in her house, plus buy the necessary feed and other inputs, enabling her to continue raising chickens.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1291429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Although she has seen the difficult side of life up close, she continues to keep her spirits high and to believe that brighter days are ahead. \n\nAnong is a mother, wife and member of the close-knit Mlabri tribe in rural northern Thailand. Although she now lives in the Ban Boonyuen Village with many of her fellow Mlabri, she spent years without stability. Like many of her fellow Mlabri, Anong was forced into indentured servitude as a field laborer working in slash & burn agriculture. She and her family worked in back-breaking toxic farming in order to pay off a never-ending cycle of debt to stronger clans.\n\nFor Anong and the rest of the Mlabri, the past decades have been full of heartbreak, tragedy and incredible perseverance. The gentle Mlabri once lived a peaceful lifestyle as migrant hunter & gatherers, but the teak deforestation and guerrilla warfare of the late 20th century destroyed their lifestyle forever.

People use meat in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolma. They always use yoghurt as a sauce. Milk products are consider very healthy and are a popular part of their diet. \n\nThis represents the only financial income for his family and to makes savings for his future family when he will decide to get marry.

Taking a loan from Kashf helped her account for expenses she thought she could never bear. Aisha is striving hard to meet her family expenditures. She is responsible for providing the family with a good environment consisting of good food, clothing, and education. Aisha needs a loan of PKR 25,000 to buy raw material such as colorful threads, beads, mirrors, and pearls for embellishment. This would help attract more customers, which ultimately helps in generating more cash. Aisha is in her 3rd loan cycle, with a good repayment

Felda joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. Felda joined One Acre Fund so that she could access the best input prices and grow enough food for the family. \r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Felda was only able to harvest a 1\/2 bag of maize per 1\/4 acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, she was able to harvest four bags per 1\/4 acre! She hopes that her profits from the 2013 Long Rains season can be used to send her children to school and buy a cow. Felda\u2019s group members will each receive input loans of a \u00bd acre during the 2013 Long Rains season. In total they will receive inputs for six acres of maize, millet and sorghum."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1292417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-02-12T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-14T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jona","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albert ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenipher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":66000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":66000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67928.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602658}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T20:18:58Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:22:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Johnston","image":142987}},{"id":526452,"name":"Zuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zuma is 31 years old.

He is the father of 9 children, all now independent adults. He works in his store which he started with his own money, initially by selling various goods from a cart in different neighborhoods in the capital. After some time he had the idea of establishing a store in his home, in order to support his wife and avoid having to go out to the streets to make his sales. He is very pleased that this business is now earning him money every day, as he has many regular clients. He receives help from his wife who manages the shop while he goes out to sell his goods on occasion in one of the city's main Markets, which is a very commercial zone good for business. He hopes to continue growing his business, and at this time is asking for a loan to buy fans, irons, blenders and basic ingredients such as rice, beans, and sugar.

He comments that thanks to his parents, he owns extensive agricultural land around the middle of the central highway where there is public transportation and long-distance buses. This support makes it easier for him to trade, as well as to maintain his sown fields. \"With all the money I could get together, I bought two cars which I can use for public transportation thanks to my older children, who manage the cars\", he states with great happiness since he always wanted to work with his children. Anastacio has casual work as a driver, transporting food throughout the country. He takes advantage of this job to also transport his own harvested crops.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, whose collaboration he is waiting for in order to continue with his goals.

Chinatown in New York City in 2011. His passion and experience, gained while living in Hong Kong before moving to the U.S. 17 years ago, allowed him to supply his local New York community with high-quality, healthful supplements. \r\n\r\nJust a year after he opened his store, however, Hurricane Sandy swept through New York, causing Man's store to lose both electrical power and clients. The storm plunged the store into a blackout for six days, and without electricity, Man lost much of his inventory supply. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to make a comeback from the storm, Man began advertising his business through the local newspaper and radio. With this added financial burden, Man has had to reduce his staff to a single part-time employee, taking on the extra hours himself. \r\n\r\nThis loan would allow Man to once again restock the inventory lost during the storm, help him recover costs for rent and once again hire a full-time employee. Man hopes to use the remainder of the loan to market his supplement store through printed and radio advertisements to bring in more customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9000,"image":{"id":1290852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

business.  As a young girl, she watched and learned from her entrepreneurial mother, whose curtain business inspired Jinny to one day start her own business.  \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Jinny traveled across the world alone to pursue schooling in the US.  After earning her degree, she started working in sushi restaurants to learn more about the industry.  As she gained more work experience and knowledge about sushi, she took note of how she wanted to serve sushi differently: with more care, creativity and much more engagement with customers.  \r\n\r\nWith over 10 years of sushi experience under her belt, Jinny and her husband used their savings to open Sushi Kuchi in July 2012.  The mission of Sushi Kuchi is to create superb, fresh and creative sushi, while creating a welcoming and engaging environment for customers.  What sets Sushi Kuchi apart is Jinny\u2019s joyful and positive attitude.  She always takes the time to speak with her customers and loves welcoming them by name. In less than a year since opening, Sushi Kuchi employs ten people and has become a favorite sushi spot in Pacific Beach, San Diego.   \r\n\r\nJinny is seeking a Kiva loan to help keep her restaurant open during the slow winter months. Having only been open since last July, the restaurant did not have enough time to adequately prepare for this winter.  A $10,000 Kiva loan will enable Jinny to keep her doors open, while allowing her to build a patio and a more attractive storefront, setting Sushi Kuchi apart from the crowd.  This new patio will also allow customers to bring their dogs, making Sushi Kuchi a pet-friendly place."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1292684,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2839,"youtubeId":"2qIuOrA2kmE","title":"Kiva Borrower

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLilia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php16,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nLilia hopes that her store will grow and that she will have more loyal customers. She dreams to give her children a good education and a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1292744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-02-12T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-14T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":6400.02,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6520.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037319},{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4266.98,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4346.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781836},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4266,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4345.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488726},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1087,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894357}],"funded_date":"2013-02-12T15:20:49Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":526554,"name":"Perla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perla is married with 2 children.

She has been in this field for more than 30 years. Adding to her income from the rice paddy, another main income has been created by her husband providing transportation service with his motorcycle linked with a trailer, which can be loaded with around 20 passengers for a one-way trip from their doorsteps to a local market, or back from the market to their houses. He is able to generate approximately 10.00 USD per day. \r\n\r\nFrom their house in a small village of the Prey Chor district, Chier\u2019s husband wants to provide motorbike repair service as his supplementary business for extra income. However, he doesn\u2019t have enough capital to buy repair tools to make this business possible. That\u2019s why his wife, Chier, is seeking financial assistance through HKL and Kiva to buy tools for their repair shop. Chier believes that this will enable her husband to generate a better income which will serve their family and improve their living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1292293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy tools for their repair shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Prey Chor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-02-12T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-14T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chier","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347090926},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355835200},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364544009},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372942681},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381722108},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390585357},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399829824},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410105214},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T09:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420253991},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429518550},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439742689},{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T09:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450056999}],"funded_date":"2013-02-13T22:25:27Z","paid_date":"2014-02-19T09:59:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":526557,"name":"Pouifi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pouifi is 22 years old and married with three children.

Her previous loan was a big help in her store, for she was able to buy more products needed in her business. Her business has been running for 11 years now, and it keeps on growing. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for a new 20,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJulita dreams to have her own stall and hopes to become rich. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She is raising 2 sons who actively help her on the farm. She has a high school education. After graduating, she worked helping her parents before getting married. Her husband passed away suddenly. Aigul is a very kind, calm, and determined woman. Thanks to her efforts and her hard work, her business is developing very well. She fattens and sells cattle, and she also sells milk. Having started this business in 1986 with a sum of only 4,000 Kyrgyzstan Som, she now has 1 cow, 1 calf, 1 horse and 11 head of livestock.

Qizlaroy herself works in animal husbandry. She buys both large and small livestock, fattens them, and sells them at the market for a profit. She has been doing this kind of work for 6 years. Now that she has a wealth of experience in this field, she wants to increase her herd. For this reason, Qizlaroy is seeking a loan so that she can purchase more livestock to fatten and sell. She plans to use the profit to further expand her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1292877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khuroson","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-02-12T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-14T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Qizlaroy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":350.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":361.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":372.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":383.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":395.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":408.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":420.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":433.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":447.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":461.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":475.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":490.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.31,"local_amount":350.3,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":358.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355876016},{"amount":157.81,"local_amount":734,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":750.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364586128},{"amount":82.46,"local_amount":383.6,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":392.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381765624},{"amount":85.09,"local_amount":395.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":404.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390628658},{"amount":87.75,"local_amount":408.1,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":417.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399872857},{"amount":90.64,"local_amount":421.6,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":431.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410149585},{"amount":93.2,"local_amount":433.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":443.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419912752},{"amount":96.02,"local_amount":446.9,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":457,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429560883},{"amount":99.14,"local_amount":460.8,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":471.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440029801},{"amount":102.21,"local_amount":475.4,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":486.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449682472},{"amount":105.37,"local_amount":490.1,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":501.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459152230}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T16:49:21Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:43:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":526588,"name":"Fuarosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fuarosa, age 37, sells German-style buns in her community to earn a living.

They have the joy together of having two great reasons for living: their children Evelides, 17, and Madeleyni, 13.  She lives in a rented adobe house.  She\u2019s worked as a cocoa bean and organic coffee grower for fifteen years on fields she acquired shortly after marrying Josu\u00e9.  This has been a good support for her family.\r\n\r\nShe heads to her fields every day very early where she spends each day providing care for her crops.  Among the chores are fertilizing, weeding and pinching off flower buds on the cocoa bean trees in order to maximize the quality of the beans sold to local crop consolidators.  She comments that some seasons the price of cocoa beans drops suddenly which negatively affects her income considerably since net profits don\u2019t cover amounts invested.\r\n\r\nWith the constant rains this season of the years, she wants to fertilize her crops with island guano because it\u2019s being a natural component greatly increases the crop\u2019s quality.  Her long-term plan points towards the purchase of a vehicle to transport her merchandise to the city.\r\n\r\nThis is her first MFP loan and she\u2019s very grateful for the opportunity provided because she considers the loan to be a great work tool for more fluid labor.  She would like to have 1,000 new soles to buy sacks of organic manure to optimize the quality of her cocoa bean plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1293257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to
