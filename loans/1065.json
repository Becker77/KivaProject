She is the mother of two children and wants the best for them. She lives in a house made of wood.\r\nAlways looking for the best for her family, she stopped working in agriculture to try her luck selling building aggregates (the sand and stone used in concrete). Thanks to the money she had previously saved, she managed to buy a small front end loader, which is operated by a driver to extract fine sand and cement from the riverbanks where she lives.\r\nShe has been working for three years in this industry and comments that, at the beginning, it was not easy because she did not have many customers. Nevertheless, her punctuality and commitment resulted in her becoming well-known in her local area and consequently she strengthened her business to be able to support her family financially.\r\nTo pay off the balance of her work tools more quickly, she would like to have financial support.\r\nHer future plans include the purchase of van to facilitate the transportation of the aggregates.

She is married to Diosdado, a vendor, with whom she has one child. Together, Angelyn and her husband work hard for a secure future for their family.\r\n\r\nAngelyn sells diesel fuel. Instead of going to the gasoline station where fuel is more expensive, drivers can just buy diesel from her with less hassle at a cheaper price. She earns a minimum of 40,000 PHP every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, Angelyn is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy more diesel from her supplier. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAngelyn hopes that her business will continue to be successful, and she hopes to have a good life.

He's in a common law marriage and has four children aged 3, 14, 18 and 20 years. Only one of them is currently in school; the other three are in the workforce. He's a seller by trade. He has been making and selling shoes ever since he was very young. He completed his education up to the second year of secondary school (equivalent to middle or junior high school). He got his start in this line of work as an assistant to his boss, who ran the same type of business. That was how he acquired experience and completely mastered the trade. By using his savings he decided to establish a business of his own, a shoemaking shop. That's how he has been able to get ahead, with support from other institutions but mostly through his own efforts and daily, hard work. He gets help from his life partner and his daughter in this business. He sells his products in Estel\u00ed and Chinandega, where he has regular customers.\r\nHe requests the loan in order to purchase raw materials such as leather, adhesive, thread, equipment, etc. - all of the supplies he needs to make his shoes. He reckons that the loan will be of great help, because he will be able to deliver his orders in a timely and adequate fashion. That way he'll be able to offer a very high quality product and keep his customers most satisfied. One of his goals for the future is to expand his business venue so that he can increase his sales and therefore improve his profits. His next goal is to buy wholesale supplies, all the ones he needs in order to make his shoes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1293321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Orozgul's children are adults, but her two single daughters live with their parents.  In 1995, Orozgul began working in animal husbandry and started the business with 10,000 KGS.  Thanks to Orozgul's hard work, her farm is now highly developed and brings in about 10,000 KGS per month. In order to further expand her business, Orozgul turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS to buy cattle for fattening. With the income from the loan, Orozgul plans to invest in further expanding her farm. In the near future she plans to marry off her daughters who are, by the way, twins.

Sodikboy's wife does not work anywhere, as she does not have high school education. She is engaged in raising the children. It is very tough for Sodikboy, as he is the only provider for the family.\r\n\r\nSodikboy works in his own studio, repairing fridges, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners and other electronic devices. He has a large number of clients in his village. Sodikboy's studio is in a very poor state, and is in need of repair. He works under bad conditions. \r\n\r\nAt the advice of an acquaintance, Sodikboy decided to apply for and receive a loan.

He started farming way back after dropping out of school. He did so many jobs but failed due to his education level. This could not lead him to a moderate life standard. \r\n\r\nHe then decided to concentrate on coffee farming which has given him a new life. As of today, Charles has managed to build a home for his family, and he can raise school fees for the children and take care of their medical bills.

She is a widow and mother to her children. She manages their household while operating the business together with her children. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNimfa operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from round palm-sized ones to much larger doormats, as well as other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding down the highway in a speeding jeepney. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNimfa dreams that her business will grow even more and hopes to have a happy and good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week, where she can share stories of her work and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God as she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1292935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

Her crops require quite a bit of maintenance and care. She must weed and water them, fertilize them, control the pests, etc.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Esperanza is requesting help so that she can buy seeds to plant peppers that she will distribute and sell in the area.

She finished her elementary education but couldn't continue studying, since she started a family at an early age.\r\n\r\nWith the help of her husband, who works in farming, she was able to start a small rubber shoe business to generate more income and be able to help her husband with the household expenses.  He makes very little, sinse he earns money during harvest time only and doesn't have a monthly income.  In her area, rubber shoes are in high demand.  They are profitable and easy to sell, considering their prices and the financial standard of living of her community.\r\n\r\nGimena learned her trade through her parents, since they are also entrepreneurs and very hard-working.  Since she was very little, she helped them with their business, which is located in the community's public market.  The market is 20 minutes from her house, which allows her to be there early in the morning.\r\n\r\nGimena is now asking for help to be able to invest in her small business by buying rubber shoes.

","en":"Abdukudus is a 46-year-old man, who lives in a village. He is married with five children, three of which are not yet school-aged. He has young children because he married late. Abdukudus's wife is not currently working because she is raising the children. In her time away from child-rearing, she helps her husband to care for and feed their cattle. \r\n\r\nAbdukudus has raised cattle for 15 years now. He also earns a living working as a guard at the collective farm. It is very difficult for him to support his family financially because he is the family's only source of income. His entire income from his job as a guard is needed simply for survival. His main income comes from raising and feeding cattle. Hence, he is trying to develop this business. If he receives this loan, Abdukudus would like to purchase cattle and feed them until spring. By spring the cattle will be grown and he can sell them for a good price. He thanks Arvand in advance for the financial support.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context, by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She gets up very early each morning so as to make the most of the time available for getting everything done; her fruit ice cream has to be prepared daily so that it can freeze and she can sell it.  After preparing her ice cream, she then starts to attend to her animals (free-range chickens).  She is very hard-working and has managed to contribute to the household expenses.  Furthermore, she is very happy because all her children have now left school and are studying at university.  She is also very grateful for the help provided by Kiva which enabled her to pay for her youngest son's studies.  She is now applying for another loan to enable her to continue supporting her family and buy supplies for making ice cream.

His current loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor. They do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers,\u201d because of their low incomes. With the received credit, Zaur will start up a fast-food caf\u00e9.

","en":"Mara, 40, learned how to be an artisan from her mother and she knows how to make everything using craft materials. Using these skills, she started her own business making necklaces, earrings, bracelets and bags, items that she sells to tourists that visit her town as well as crafts stores that she has been doing business with for years.  The market where she sells her goods is growing everyday and her production is down because she doesn't have the working capital to diversify her product line to meet the rising demand.  She is currently applying for her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy plastic tubing, rice or sisal fiber, thread, clasps, paint and other supplies so she can increase her production.

Ever since she was a young woman she has always worked in farming activities related to coffee and organic cacao.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, with the intention of giving her little Anderson more attention, she chose to open a grocery store, together with Carlos, on the first floor of her house.

Ciudad que aun conservando espacios verdes, forma parte de la zona urbana de la ciudad. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo con 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, que pretenden aprovechar cada oportunidad para ser el sustento de sus pobladores.

","en":"Pastaza is located in the center of the ecuadorian highlands, near the rainforest and in the middle of the countryside. This canton belongs to the province of the same name, which belongs to the Republic of Ecuador's amazonic region. It is an urban area, but the town still preserves its green areas. The city of Puyo is the largest in the canton, located 924 meters above sea level. It is demographically small, but there is a great variety of sites which are preferred tourist destinations for domestic and international visitors, especially those related to ecological activities and extreme sports. The city's economy is growing daily, due to commercial activity, ranching, farming, and tourism. Every opportunity is seized for these activities to support its inhabitants. In every business there are people who have not given up in the face of unemployment and have started their own business ventures in order to earn a decent living and make their dreams come true. \r\n\r\nThat is the case of Segundo, a young man who at the age of 24 has made a way for himself in order to get ahead. After he finished primary school, he had difficulty finding work, so four years ago, he adapted his land to the production of sugarcane and the raising of pigs to sell. He learned from his parents' example. They always worked hard in this business in order to raise their family and cover their daily needs. Segundo is single, and has high expectations for his future.\r\n\r\nHe is undoubtedly an enterprising man. He invests ten hours per day in tending to his crops and animals, as well as in cleaning up the pigsties and selling his products. He wants his business to grow so that he can become known in his whole area, which is why he has requested a loan. He will use it to purchase baby pigs so that he can continue with his business, because he must replace the ones that are sold. He will also take another step towards expanding his business, which is to increase his pigsties so that he can offer more animals. Segundo has had a hard time obtaining capital from financial institutions, so he is grateful to Kiva for intervening so that people all over the world are able to live their dreams.

The start-up loan program is designed to provide business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to traditional credit products. These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan, Zaza plans to start his own bakery.

With this loan, she hopes to make an average monthly profit of 45,000 francs CFA, which she will reinvest in her business and also use to help her husband with certain family expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1293674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy wax pagne-style cloth and damask.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-02-13T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-15T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astan               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347180096},{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922909},{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636457},{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029941},{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819448}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T22:34:23Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":526860,"name":"Pascasie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pascasie is 27 years old.

","en":"Mar\u00eda Magdalena is a 38-year-old, married woman who has four children, three of whom are in school and one who is special (he was born with hydrocephalus).  Her family works in farming, planting and growing coffee 15 minutes from her house and transporting it on foot every day.  As they are in school, her children help their parents with the fieldwork on the weekends and they help care for their brother daily.  When she was a child, Mar\u00eda Magdalena was not able to go to school for financial reasons, as her parents have few economic means.  Because she was not able to attend even a year of school, she had to work hard since she was very young.  Mar\u00eda has a small grocery store in her house that generates income and helps with the expenses that come up at home every day, such as clothing, restrictive medications, food, and the purchase of products to sell.  However, she puts a lot of effort into tending her shop and caring for her son while her other children are at school and her husband is out in the fields.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Magdalena is currently asking for help to clean, plant, and maintain their crop, as there is a disease (rust) that is going around that affects coffee plants and they lost part of their crop.  However, with the loan she will be able to plant a more resistant varietal.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to pay off her loan with the earnings from her harvest and to have enough to buy the medications her son with hydrocephalus needs.  However, her dream is to see her children graduate and find professions that give them good employment opportunities and a better way of life and for them to be respectable men and women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1291512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to clean, plant, and maintain her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"san nicolas, santa barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-02-13T23:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-15T23:00:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.6,"local_amount":11.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":11.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364498808},{"amount":1024.4,"local_amount":19988.33,"processed_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":20411.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082504}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T17:55:08Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:09:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":526846,"name":"Kaliko","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kaliko is a farmer who grows grows sugarcane, cabbage, and bananas.

She has been able to see her family advance in life thanks to this economic activity. She has two children with her partner, ages 8 and 13. Her business idea was born out of the necessity to generate her own income, in particular to help care for her children who, as they grow, have many more needs that require more money. Her husband, who works as a contractor for a business in the area, was the one who motivated her to get started. Her principal customers are her neighbors in the area who complement their good looks with the accessories that Isabel sells. In the same market, she also sells sausages like Butifarra (Catalan style sausage), salchichas (sausage), salchich\u00f3n (a salami-like sausage), among other kinds of meats she purchases in the city market, which helps her to generate new sources of income that makes her life, and that of her family, that much better. She is currently applying for a loan with kiva and her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

What she likes most about her work is to be able to sell her crops because she can see the fruit of so much effort.  Once a month she travels to the capital of the country to sell the gladiolus flowers that she plants.  For the future this hardworking woman wants to continue planting in greater quantities.  \u201cPlant everything that is profitable, upon harvesting each product each month, profit is obtained and thus one can cover the main expenses,\u201d she mentions.  \r\n\r\nThe season for planting peas is approaching, for that she needs help because she doesn\u2019t want to be left behind.  This persevering woman intends to start a few fields of potatoes, corn and peas, for that she needs help.  This is her 7th loan with MFP.  She mentions that she will pay the installments responsibly.  She belongs to the communal bank \u201cLos Picaflores de Patay\u201d (The Hummingbirds of Patay) where she feels comfortable, having members whose goals are similar.  With the requested 3800 (PEN), she will invest in the purchase of potato, corn and gladiolus flower seeds.  She will have 1000 soles (PEN) left over with which she intends to purchase bags of organic fertilizer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1293957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy potato, gladiolus flower and corn seed and organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-14T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-16T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1475,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3811.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996298}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T19:07:20Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melanie Snellings","image":null}},{"id":527383,"name":"Angelica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ang\u00e9lica de 39 a\u00f1os, vive junto a su esposo Luis y sus 3 hijos a los que quiere mucho.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLilia operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, ranging from round palm sized ones, to the much larger doormats, but also offers other crafts that most rug-makers come across every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, they are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabrics, threads and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLilia dreams of expanding her business further and hopes that her business will grow even more. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.
