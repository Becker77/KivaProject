Her daughter was employed as a field manager in 2012. Even though the family owns a house on their own land, they live in a traditional Mongolian ger (portable felt tent).

She is already a widow and a mother to her child. She manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLolita operates a bakery. Breads and spreads are staples in the usual Filipino cuisine, and are used mostly for breakfast and snacks. The most popular type of bread is the Pandesal, a Filipino version of the Spanish Pan de Sal or salted bread. It is baked during the wee hours of the morning and sold steaming hot to early commuters, students and workers. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLolita hopes to have another branch and dreams of having another vehicle. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She is 40 years old, married, and lives with her husband and two children (21 and 16 years old). Irma requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for starting a trading business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her job, which is usually a requirement for the local credit providers. Irma\u2019s business is a small canteen at the local school, where she sells cheese pies, juices and different kinds of snacks among students.\r\n Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Irma will purchase clothing and bed clothing at wholesale prices and resell them in her town and nearby villages for a profit. It will be hard work for Irma, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the trading business to increase her stock and sales volume. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs in order to improve their living

His first loan was of 1,000,000 Uganda Shillings (UGX) which he serviced well.\r\n\r\nDenis did not continue with his education after finishing form four because his parents didn't have money to fund his tuition. So he had to look for businesses in order to provide for his family. He went to a driving school so that he could learn driving, and later on he got into the taxi business because there was a demand by the Sudanese and other business people who wished to offer him a job. He uses the income to pay rent and look after his brother's sons (dependents), saving the balance with Ugafode Micro-finance Ltd.\r\n\r\nWith the savings, the bought a piece of land for 1,500,000 Uganda Shillings (UGX) which he used to save on his account.

She's also going to expand her bookstore because she sells other products (sweets, ice cream, gifts for Valentine's Day and Mother's Day, etc.).\r\n\r\nHer long-term goal is to buy a photocopier and a computer to use in her business because she doesn't have these resources and her customers request them frequently.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1294762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy furniture for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Antigua Guatemala,Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2013-02-14T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-16T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Priscila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":416.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.5,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":458.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356489364},{"amount":60.25,"local_amount":463.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":472.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364515714},{"amount":60.87,"local_amount":468.23,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":477.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373129852},{"amount":54.19,"local_amount":416.81,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":425.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381935148},{"amount":59.01,"local_amount":453.96,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":462.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390798671},{"amount":56.04,"local_amount":431.05,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":439.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399810270},{"amount":55.7,"local_amount":428.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":436.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410086327},{"amount":56.8,"local_amount":436.92,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":445.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419852745},{"amount":188.64,"local_amount":1451.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1479.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429501560}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T20:14:38Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T15:24:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":527168,"name":"Fidela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fidela earns a living through her retailing business selling various items like kitchenware, personal and cosmetic care products, and food and beverages like eggs and cocoa drink.

She has a great source of motivation, which is her little one-year-old Ariana. She lives with her small family in a rented house built with noble materials. She used to help her mother sell food at a local fair. Years later, when her relationship with Efrain became official, thanks to some savings they successfully opened a beauty salon in a rented space located within the central area of her town. Thanks to the skills she learned from an accelerated hairdressing class, she's able to use her business to solidly contribute to her family's finances. She reports that she enjoys her work very much, because during this time of the year the influx of customers is very good. For that reason she wishes to have enough capital to purchase beauty supplies and provide hair dyeing as well as other services that are requested by her customers.\r\nHer long-term goal is to earn enough money to purchase a plot of land.

She wants to have steady work, with the goal to go to college for a business administration degree and fulfill a dream she has had since she was a little girl.

In her free time she likes to read a little bit and sometimes cooks Carapulcra con Sopa Seca [a pork and potato stew with noodles] to share with her family.\r\n\r\nBy her own initiative, and with a lot of dedication and tenacity, Cinthia works as a primary school teacher at a school in her city. She starts every day early in the morning and can work for up to 11 hours. She is happy doing her work and believes that her patience and good treatment of her students make it go well.\r\n\r\nCinthia is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help she will be able to cover the cost of her young son's education, who will soon start school. She has to pay his enrollment fees and buy his supplies. This way Cinthia can keep working. Soon she would like to do a certification course to update her knowledge. Cinthia hopes to achieve her greatest dream of finishing construction on their home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1294838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to cover her son's school expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-15T05:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-17T05:00:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cinthia Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":164.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":176.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":182.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":190.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":197.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":205.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":214.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.96,"local_amount":164.89,"processed_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":170.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776414},{"amount":67.07,"local_amount":167.68,"processed_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":173.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483229},{"amount":70.51,"local_amount":176.28,"processed_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":182.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889265},{"amount":72.82,"local_amount":182.05,"processed_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":188.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664172},{"amount":76.31,"local_amount":190.77,"processed_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":197.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775365},{"amount":247.33,"local_amount":618.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":639.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778915}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T15:51:34Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:40:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":527227,"name":"Rukiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukiya has been married for several years.

She works every day throughout the week. She is also a fish monger who buys fish from fishermen and sells to the people neighboring the lake, as well as others.\r\n\r\nShe started the business in 2002. It is located in Kasenyi, a landing site in Kasese western Uganda. She was troubled with lack of capital and her search for sources of finance to expand her business landed her in a group funded by Ugafode and she has never looked back since.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money to buy more locally brewed beers for selling. Her clients are people around the lake shores of Kasenyi, especially the fish mongers. She hopes to be a prosperous business lady in the future.

loves and who are his main reason for living. Unfortunately, some time ago Justo lost his beloved wife, and since then he is the pillar who works to keep his family together. Justo is very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic. He was not able to study a professional career - he would have chosen Civil Engineering - but he would have very much liked to have done so. In his free time he likes to listen to music and sometimes cooks a delicious roasted chicken to share with his family.\r\n\r\nBy his own initiative, and with a lot of tenacity and dedication, Justo works in the field of construction. He is a master builder and works about 8 hours a day. He is happy doing his work and thinks that it goes well because of his good finished products.\r\n\r\nJusto is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he will be able to buy a computer which will help his younger children as a tool for their studies. He will continue working hard to achieve his greatest dream of having his own business, and with that he hopes to be able to get his family ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1294847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a computer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-15T05:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-17T05:50:05Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":67.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":73.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":77.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":80.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":87.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":90.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.15},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.38,"local_amount":67.14,"processed_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":68.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776415},{"amount":26.73,"local_amount":68.04,"processed_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":69.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483230},{"amount":28.15,"local_amount":71.66,"processed_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":72.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889266},{"amount":29.02,"local_amount":73.87,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775366},{"amount":30.46,"local_amount":77.54,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":78.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778916},{"amount":31.51,"local_amount":80.2,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":81.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054126},{"amount":67.11,"local_amount":170.84,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":173.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819056},{"amount":35.64,"local_amount":90.71,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":92.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472049}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T15:07:32Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:21:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":527242,"name":"Mot-Praise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mot-Praise lives in West Point, one of the most populated and well-known markets in Montserrado county.

The group has nine women and one man. Beatrice is on the right side of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her on credit, consisting of the necessary materials to plant \u00bd an acre of maize, millet and sorghum. \r\n\r\nBeatrice joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains in 2008, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. She joined One Acre Fund so that she could gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and learn good farming techniques. Prior to joining, Beatrice was only able to harvest three bags of maize per acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, she was able to harvest six bags per acre.

After separating from her husband she had to look for a means of survival to support her six children.  Without any capital, she opted to go to the landing site, where she  could access fish from the fishermen on credit and then pay after selling them. \r\n\r\nWhen she learnt of the Ugafode group from a friend at the same site she found it was wise to join since she would be able to get more fish with the loan money and therefore increase her sales.

He is pictured with 11 One Acre Fund farmers, 8 women and 3 men. Donald is standing on the right with his hand raised. He is receiving an input loan for \u00bd an acre of maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation. Donald first enrolled with One Acre Fund during the 2011 Long Rains and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. Donald joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and use increased profits to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nDonald reports that before One Acre Fund, he was able to grow about 1\/2 a bag of maize per \u00bd acre, but with his One Acre Fund input loan during Long Rains 2012, he harvested 8 bags per 1\/2 acre.

She also takes care of additional family members (grandsons). She has a business of selling charcoal and has been in this business for five years.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan of 1700000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more bags of charcoal.

The group has 26 women and 8 men. Jane is on the right of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her on credit consisting of the necessary materials to plant one half acre of maize, millet and sorghum. Jane is a new One Acre Fund farmer and is excited for the 2013 Long Rains season. She joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and access the best input prices. \r\n\r\nLast year, Jane harvested three bags of maize on one acre of land. She is excited to improve her harvest as a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season.

In 2010, after failing to continue with formal education due to lack of tuition, Mathias started a produce trade business as a way of getting income. This business is getting him some money most especially during the boom season for produce after harvest season.\r\nHowever, he is always challenged by the limited capital in his business, together with the changing weather that affect agricultural production.\r\n\r\nMathias wants a loan of 1,000,000 shillings (UGX) to complete construction of his residential house and have a good living environment for the family. His dream is to start up a business for his wife so that they can expand on the earnings of the family as well as seeing his current business growing to a much bigger size as compared to the current size. He will use the proceedings from the business to repay the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1293823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials to complete his residential house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kagadi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-02-15T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-17T15:20:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mathias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":176329.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589814},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":166666,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":176328.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993774},{"amount":5.04,"local_amount":12597,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":13327.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831108},{"amount":35.6,"local_amount":88999,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":94158.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689336},{"amount":28.03,"local_amount":70071,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74133.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480480},{"amount":110.67,"local_amount":276667,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":292707.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419984052},{"amount":19.6,"local_amount":49000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":51840.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429636245},{"amount":1.07,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2820.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459234098},{"amount":9.2,"local_amount":23000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":24333.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468059634},{"amount":57.46,"local_amount":143667,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":151996.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504415326}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T15:15:19Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T18:41:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":527314,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet lives in Magibi county, which is the largest rubber-producing plantation in Liberia.

She's grateful for and also very happy about this opportunity, which she considers a great working tool that's indispensable for doing her job fluidly.\r\n\r\nThis first time, she wants to have 1,000 nuevos soles [PEN] to hire workers and continue with the second weeding of the growing season to make the most of the final crop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1295240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-15T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-17T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Renilda","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":108.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":117.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":114.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":124.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":124.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":132.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":137.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":140.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.5,"local_amount":108.74,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-19T08:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":111.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123096},{"amount":46.84,"local_amount":117.11,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":120.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868938},{"amount":45.79,"local_amount":114.47,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":117.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577779},{"amount":49.89,"local_amount":124.73,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":128.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530010},{"amount":49.74,"local_amount":124.34,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":127.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975040},{"amount":53.17,"local_amount":132.93,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":136.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996309},{"amount":54.92,"local_amount":137.3,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":141.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863831},{"amount":56.15,"local_amount":140.38,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":144.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352291}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T22:24:01Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:01:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":527316,"name":"Winifred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Winifred is 43 years old and lives in in Magibi county, which is the largest rubber-producing plantation in Liberia.

Due lack of tuition, Samuel dropped out of school and started farming on a small scale as a way of earning some money and looking after himself.

With her last loan, she invested in her business, where she sells food.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International Dominican Republic runs a program for their good clients, who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their businesses, and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house, at the same time running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nAdriana is a single woman. She works and lives in a rural town in Samana. She will use this loan to buy cement and other construction materials to finish building her roof and the wall coating.

Esperanza International is running a program where most of their clients pay back their loans, fulfill the commitment to expand their businesses and show fidelity in their groups. They can request loans to improve their homes while running their businesses and attending groups meetings. \r\n\r\nElupina is living in a rural town with her long term partner and her only child. She started building her house with their family savings and her business profits. She took out loans with Esperanza almost three years ago to expand her business selling clothes. Elupina will finish building the floor for her house while the other member, Jimena, will build her house roof. Both members request a housing loan for their home improvement.\r\n\r\nElupina and Jimena thank you all for your support!!!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1293986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is a widow and a mother. Her youngest is still in college. At her age, she is working as hard as she can to provide income for her everyday needs and to help her family as well.\r\n\r\nBenita maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange and other brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalog and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nBenita dreams of expanding her business and having her own stall. She hopes for good health and a strong body. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. She also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1294069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

All of the children attend school.  The oldest daughter is graduating from school this year.  Gulsara has been involved in animal husbandry since 1995, having started this business with an initial sum of 5,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, today the business contains one dairy cow and five sheep, and the monthly profit from sales of milk to the local processing plant amounts to about 8,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Gulsara requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy 15 sheep.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further expanding her business and providing an education for her

She is 28 years old.  She has been helping her parents raise livestock since childhood.  After getting married, her life has been very hard because her husband is involved in providing house repairs, and his income is very small.  Marguba is raising three children.  Her children grow year after year and demand more comforts.  She decided to organize her own business to earn an income.  With this goal in mind, she completed the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association for Business Women, and obtained a certificate.  She learned a lot of new information from this course for herself and wrote her business plan.  She wants to organize a business of buying and selling livestock because she has experience in this type of business.  Marguba is requesting a loan in the amount of 1500 somoni to buy livestock in order to start her new business.  This loan will help her to improve her living conditions and, thus, bring happiness to her home.  She awaits your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1293748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She is 48 years old, married, and lives with her husband, son and a daughter-in-law. Nino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start a trading business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her job, which is usually demanded by the local credit providers. The only source for the family is the small monthly salary earned by Nino\u2019s husband working as a cook. The income is hardly enough for the four-member family. Nino\u2019s loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the loan, Nino will purchase clothing and bed clothing at wholesale prices and resell them in her town and nearby villages for a profit. It will be hard work for Nino, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in her trading business to increase her stock and sales volume. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs in order to improve their living

With regards to this matter, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will be using this amount to buy eggplant, bitter gourd, string beans, and some ingredients for her native cakes such as sugar, condensed milk, and gluten for her food production and sales business.

For the past two years, Angella has been working hard to manage her small market where she sells raw food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Angella has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more raw food such as bananas and cassava to sell and will help Angella to generate greater profits and take good care of herself and her family. Angella hopes that in the future, she will be able to have a better life. \r\n\r\nAngella is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

He has a big fifteen year experience in the field of animal husbandry. His father was engaged in livestock breeding and Nemat since childhood helped his father. \r\n\r\nHe had one sheep for which he had to provide care. As Nemat himself says, \"I was very fond of that little gray sheep. Then that was a child's enthusiasm. Now this is my income and life earnings.\" He grew up and followed in his father's footsteps. He started his activities with two heads of sheep. Initially, it was not easy for him, especially in the winter when the whole earth was covered with snow and he had to spend more money to feed the livestock. But years of experience proved themselves out and Nemat began to find ways to address the challenges and to better promote his business. \r\n\r\nNow, he has more than 50 head of sheep. His wife and three children are also involved in the business. Nemat is also a master bricklayer and plasterer. He works part-time for accommodation, his children's education and daily expenses. \r\n\r\nDue to the season, he cannot sell his sheep now as prices have fallen. Nemat needs additional resources to continue caring for his livestock and to acquire new livestock. To this end, he appealed to MDO Arvand for a loan. He plans to use the loan to buy livestock. He is grateful to Arvand for the support and their huge rule in his life.

She is a motivated and successful woman. Her husband Bakhtier is proud of her. They have one child who is not yet an adult. Gulbahor lives together with her family happily, but poorly. \r\n\r\nTheir income does not allow them to buy all the necessary things for a living, and therefore Gulbahor decided to organize her own business buying and selling men's clothing. To that end, she took a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate. From this course, she learned a lot, and now she is ready to organize her own business. She will trade in the local market, and her husband will help her in running the business.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 15,000 somoni to buy goods, in order to establish a new business.

The more fish displayed at her stall the better. More items to sell will result in better profit.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAngelina hopes that her business will continue to grow.

His children are all grown, and three live separately outside the home.  Nurmuhamed's wife works in the home and his children actively help out as well.  While searching for a source of income in 1991 after the Soviet Union collapsed, Nurmuhamed started his own business with 10,000 KGS, working with livestock.    Thanks to his tenacity and perseverance, today his business brings in around 15,000 KGS each month from the sale of diary and meat products, and he now has three head of cattle, five goats, and one horse.  The income from his business allowed Nurmhamed to marry off his children.  With the goal of further increasing the number among his livestock, Nurmuhamed has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy two horses.  He plans to use his profits to expand the number of his livestock even further as well as to save for his youngest son's wedding.

Since 1995, Gulnara has worked with livestock, having started her business with an initial sum of 10,000 KGS.   Thanks to her hard work, the business has developed under Gulnara's care.  She now brings in around 10,000 KGS a month from the sale of milk, and the reselling of cattle.  With the goal of further growth, Gulnara has turned to the company Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 KGS to buy five head of cattle and one dairy cow.  With the profits from the loan, Gulnara plans to increase the number of domestic animals among her livestock in order to have the opportunity to marry off her sons and daughter in the near future.

She is 38 years old. She is married and is raising three children. \r\n\r\nFrom an early age, she had a big interest in sewing women's clothes. Growing up, she learned this craft from an experienced seamstress and always sewed clothes for her family. Since her husband went to Russia and is not able to send enough money, Mavzuna decided to exercise her craft in a business and in this way to provide for her family. \r\n\r\nWith this aim, she took a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate. She is ready to establish a business and to provide good service to her customers. Her brother's wife will help her in running the business. She needs new sewing machines (one for sewing, another for embroidery), but does not have the money. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 12,000 somoni to buy new sewing

She is a woman who has devoted her life to her only child. She is divorced and provides for the child alone. \r\n\r\nZebokhon does not have a higher education, such that she could work in a prestigious organization and earn a good salary. She did not agree to become a maid or a waitress, because such work was not to her liking. For her it was a great joy to take a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women. From this course, she learned a lot of new things about business and wrote her own business plan. Now, she is fully able to establish her own business and to become successful in this sphere. She wants to start a business buying and selling women's and children's clothing, as this type of business has high demand among the population. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 5,000 somoni to buy goods to establish a new business. This loan will help her to improve living conditions.

She lives in Gurjaani District with her husband and two daughters (18 and 14 years old). Natasha has requested several previous loans from local financial institutions for her family business start-up without any success. Her loan request has been rejected many times because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of the income for the family is the small monthly salary earned by Natasha\u2019s husband who works locally as a watchman. The family belongs to the vulnerable poor category and they get monthly social assistance from the local government. \r\n\r\nNatasha is requesting a loan from Credo to re-start-up her family business that she had to stop due to financial problems. She will use her loan to purchase pigs to start an animal husbandry business. She will put the pigs in a shed in the yard and raise and sell them for a higher price. Natasha's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country rural poor who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income.

Hoy su principal producto es el  uniforme  escolar, que comercializa directamente, mediante convenios con instituciones educativas. En su esquema de mercadeo sus instituciones educativas, que son sus principales clientes le adelantan el 50% del costo del n\u00famero de productos a elaborar, y el otro 50%  una vez entregue la totalidad del contrato.  Rosa tambi\u00e9n tiene clientes individuales a los que les vende a cr\u00e9dito y sus operaciones las desempe\u00f1a de lunes a domingos. En la actualidad Rosa ha recibido 9 financiamientos de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual ha comprado maquinarias, materias primas e insumos, con los cuales ha mejorado sus tiempos productivos, e incrementado su capital de trabajo. Su meta es ampliar su taller, generando m\u00e1s empleos a operarias, para finalmente remodelar su vivienda y lograr con su trabajo persistente, esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n todos sus sue\u00f1os. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 telas para confeccionar uniformes escolares que tiene encargados y para lo que requiere complementar el otro 50% para dar cumplimento a su contrato de manera oportuna. ","en":"Rosa, 57 years old, makes clothing, especially uniforms. In her 37 years of experience she has known how to sustain her business and created a way to earn income with which she started her own family and could support the household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe idea to start her own business was born after she learned the trade, taking courses where she learned tailoring and dressmaking, starting first making children\u2019s clothing, and later for teenagers and clothing in general plus mending.\r\n\r\nToday her main product is school uniforms that she sells directly, through contracts with educational institutions. Her marketing arrangement with educational institutions, who are her main customers, is that they advance 50% of the cost of the number of products to be made, and the other 50% when she delivers the entire order.\r\n\r\nRosa also has individual customers to whom she offers credit and her business is done from Monday through Sunday. At the moment Rosa has received 9 loans through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which she has bought machines, staples and supplies, with which she has improved her turnaround and increased her working capital.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her workshop, creating more jobs for employees, and lastly to remodel her home and to succeed through her persistent work, effort, and dedication to all her dreams.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, in order to buy fabric to make school uniforms for the orders she has which require finishing the other 50% in order to complete the contract in a timely manner.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1295414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Sus principales productos son los cosm\u00e9ticos de diversas marcas pues trabaja mediante el sistema de cat\u00e1logos, es decir hace sus promociones con 4 gu\u00edas especializadas de productos provenientes de multinacionales con las que establece sus relaciones comerciales.

For four years she has made a living in commerce, an activity with which she generates income that supports the well-being of her family.  Her main products are various brands of cosmetics as she works through a system of catalogues, that is to say she makes her promotions with 4 specialized product guides coming from multinational companies with which she establishes her business relations.  In her strategy she deals with the market of Puerto Colombia and also she has customers in the city of Barranquilla, located 20 minutes away.  In order to deliver the products she requests 50% and gives credit for the rest of the value of the products that each customer chooses, taking into account a payment plan that she establishes with each one, not exceeding 30 days.  Gradually, her requests for orders increases, particularly in the special seasons, like the one which occurs soon, when families celebrate Mothers' Day.  In her house she always has an inventory of the products that rotate more, so that her clients, when they ask her for something, aren\u2019t leaving empty-handed.  She always takes advantage of the offers that the magazines carry, in order to have an impact on her market.  \r\n\r\nAmong her goals is that of organizing a small storehouse and for this she has planned her Kiva loan, her second financing made from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the first financing she bought a metal display cabinet to organize her inventory and products that have been requested by her clientele, such as perfumes, feminine accessories, items of costume jewelry, etc.  The reason for the success of her investment is her great experience, the opportunity to purchase special offers in greater quantities and that she makes them precisely in the season where the sales are increased as a result of the special days like carnivals.  That is why she turns to a Kiva loan with which she will buy colognes, perfumes, creams, cosmetics, deodorants and feminine undergarments.
