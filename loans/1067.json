Nancy joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. Nancy joined One Acre Fund so that she could gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and access the best input prices.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Nancy was only able to harvest one bag of maize per acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, she was able to harvest eight bags per acre.

She used to work as a milker in the city dairy factory.  She has many awards and recognitions.  As she remembers, \"those were good times.  There were many cows and the gave rich, tasty milk.  I was the lead worker and drew up to 110 liters of milk every day and looked after the cows.  The cows even had their own names.  Since then, I still have a passion for livestock.\"\r\n\r\nLike many others, Kumri was left without work when the factory closed.  Tough times came and she decided to start her own small farm.  At that moment, her ten years of experience came in handy.  She bought two cows, sold their milk, and she began to earn a living this way.  Kumri's husband helped her with the raising and feeding of the cows.  Thanks to her her work and positive attitude, Kumri was able to raise her three small children.  But a year ago, she lost one cow to an illness and she had to sell the other because she needed the money.  Now Kumri has one cow and she wants to get another one.  With this goal in mind, she turned to \"Arvand\" for financial support.  She wants to raise livestock and sell their milk so she can earn a living.  That way, she will be able to put aside some of her husband's money to save for her children's future.  Kumri thanks \"Arvand\" for their financial help and for their support of people who are going through difficult times."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1292400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-16T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-18T11:00:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\u041a\u0443\u043c\u0440\u0438","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":322.6},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":344.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.59,"local_amount":322.6,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":345.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863712},{"amount":74.97,"local_amount":333.21,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":356.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572655},{"amount":77.44,"local_amount":344.19,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":368.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971425}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T11:44:02Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":527703,"name":"Wetinyia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wetinyia is a group of 11 farmers in Kakamega South District represented by Margaret.

Her last loan was invested in the business where she sells groceries.\r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business, and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nCarmen lives in part of her house with her long-term partner and her only child. She started building this house long time ago, but she couldn't finish it, so now she is requesting this loan to buy cement and other construction materials to finish covering the concrete block and to build the roof. She thanks God, Esperanza Internacional, and all of you for this opportunity. In her name and that of her family, thanks to all of you for your support!

Teresita is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store sells inexpensive items, often asking a single price for each item in the store. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, five pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Teresita purchases her inventory at wholesale prices and then sells it by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She does a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTeresita is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her inventory.\r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of expanding her business and having a peaceful and a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She is married to Enrico and a mother to their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating her business. They work hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nMaricel sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling companies like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. The dealer orders products for the customer, who is given one month to pay for them. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalog, providing a profit to the dealer. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Maricel is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise such as shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other products. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMaricel hopes to be a successful businesswoman and dreams of having a happy family. Each week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1294871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for supplies and merchandise for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-02-16T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-18T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2170.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037372},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2171.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781889},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2712.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488778},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1085.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894408}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T16:05:57Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joy Adams","image":1247614}},{"id":527899,"name":"Almeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Almeda is 58 years old and lives in La Libertad.

She is a widow and a mother to her children. She, together with her children, manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRebecca operates a food stall. She sells snacks like banana cue and kamote cue. Banana cue is a popular snack food in the Philippines of deep fried bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar. Banana cue is made from Saba bananas. Kamote cue is made from sweet potato. It is coated with brown sugar and then fried to cook the potatoes and caramelize the sugar. It is usually skewered on a bamboo stick, and is sold on the streets.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 10,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy bananas, sweet potatoes, sugar, oil, and gas. \r\n\r\nRebecca hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of having a good life.

She is married to Ruel and a mother to her children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. Marivic works hard to provide income for their everyday expenses, and has been in this business for twenty three years now.\r\n\r\nMarivic operates her family business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, and sell them with a little profit. Her products are kids clothing and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 17,000 loan.

She is a married woman who has been working as a saleswoman for over five years. She specialises in the sale of fabrics, rings, bracelets and necklaces and various accessories for women. She has managed to repay two previous loans that she contracted from one of the U-IMCEC offices where she is a member. She requests a new loan of 150.000 CFA francs destined to the purchase of articles that she sells in order to answer the growing demand of her clientele. The increase in profits that she will make from this loan will enable her to build up her stock, to facilitate her management of her family's daily expenses and to improve their dietary conditions.

I decided that I would pursue this art and come up with new, attractive designs. Initially, I was creating small bags and customers encouraged me to continue. I work with all kinds of materials \u2013 corn husks, plantain leaves, kente cloth, fabric, leather, plywood, foam, raffia, twine and cotton cord. I've had the opportunity to teach over a hundred young people how to weave with corn husks.

someday venture off on his own as an independent contractor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever in a million years did I think I\u2019d be doing this,\u201d Charlie says.\r\n\r\nWhile it wasn\u2019t his original goal, Charlie has excelled in his work and found his niche. Being self-employed is just the appropriate next step. Charlie will use his Kiva loan to help him purchase his own truck, the primary expense to being an independent contractor. \r\n\r\nCharlie looks forward to the opportunity. He says, for his personality, it\u2019s much more motivating to be paid in the stops and miles versus in hours worked. \r\n\r\n\u201cI love making my own schedule, going to work when I feel like it, and being more independent overall,\u201d he says. \r\n\r\nCharlie was born and raised in New Orleans and although some jobs take him to other locations around Southeast Louisiana, he says he enjoys that most of his days are spent driving around the city, hauling shipping containers on his truck. \r\n\r\n\u201cBeing on the road every day, you get to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says.  \r\n\r\nCharlie is ready to revel in his new freedom as his own boss, but at the same time, he already has his eye on the future. His ultimate goal is to purchase at least two or three additional trucks and hire drivers under him. He likes the idea of creating jobs in the community and helping others get their start in a career he finds rewarding.\r\n\r\nTo get there, Charlie will be diligently saving his profits. While it can be difficult to put away savings, Charlie says it\u2019s easy when you know exactly what you are going to do with the funds. Despite not envisioning this path four years ago, today Charlie says he knows exactly where he\u2019s going and looks forward to growing his business for years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1295539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To
