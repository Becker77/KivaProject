The group has 30 women and 11 men and is represented by Alphonce. Alphonce is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. His credit will cover the necessary farming inputs (seed and fertilizer) to plant a half acre of maize, millet, and sorghum. Alphonce joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2007, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. Alphonce joined One Acre Fund so that he could gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and use increased profits to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Alphonce was only able to harvest five bags of maize per 3\/4 acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, he was able to harvest eight bags per half acre! He hopes that his profits from the 2013 Long Rains season can be used to send his children to school and to repair his home. For the 2013 Long Rains season, Alphonce\u2019s group members will take loans toward inputs for half acre each. In total, this group will receive input loans for use on 20.5 acres of land.

These five hardworking women belong to a non-tribal community and live in a small village located in Northeastern India in the state of Manipur. They believe in collective effort as a group to support one another and pave the way for a better fortune.\r\n\r\nMusuk is the profile representative of the group, photographed with her hand raised. She is the mother of two children and has been maintaining the family affairs with the meagre income from her husband's carpentry activities. In order to supplement the family income, she decided to start working on some activities so she can earn for the family. Before the loan, she was growing vegetables for consumption in her homestead garden.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, with her first loan, she started an embroidery business to generate her income. Mainly, she embroiders the borderline of the traditional wrap-rounds. She has a sewing machine. She will use this loan to purchase thread in colours and needles for her work.  Her embroidery work has been a success and, in the course of time, she can pay back the loan.\r\n\r\nMusuk wishes to include poultry as another activity for better income opportunity. Her interest in poultry was fulfilled after she bought chicks and ducklings and raised them. Her dream is to purchase a used mini truck, which she believes is a need for the villagers to cart all the essential goods in the village. She would charge a fixed carrier cost.\r\n\r\nMusuk needs another loan to continue with her embroidery work and start her new poultry farm. She will use this loan to purchase chicks to raise and sell for profit. Likewise, the rest of her group members have made steady improvement and need another loan for their respective income activities such as weaving, embroidery and selling vegetables, to mention a few.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1294371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy thread in colours for embroidering and to buy chicks to raise and sell for profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-02-17T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-19T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bidumukhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musuk","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nganbi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T21:53:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":528487,"name":"Unidas Venceremos 1, 2 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martira is the coordinator of her group \"Unidas Venceremos 2\" (Unite to Win).

This group is located in Samana, a lush, rugged peninsula with a nascent tourism industry. Here, running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. Luz makes her home in a simple structure with her long-time partner and their four children.\r\n\r\nLuz is excited to be taking her 17th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her cafeteria by purchasing necessary products such as bread, cheese, ham, beans, sweets (candies), and other comestible items as well as a blender.\r\n\r\nLuz will use the profits to improve her business, to rebuild her house, and to provide for her family's needs. She dreams that her children will grow up to be good people. She thanks you all for your support.

","en":"Holmurot is a 38 year old man living in a rural area.  He is married and has two children.  His wife doesn't work because she doesn't have a higher education.  Holmurot also only finished high school.  He is a peasant farmer.  But what he earns on the collective farm isn't enough to get by on.  Several years ago, Holmurot decided to get into the business of raising cattle since this brings a very good income.  He raises cattle that he buys at the market while they are still calves.  After raising them and fattening them up, he sells them at an advantageous price.  His wife helps him in her free time.  \r\n\r\nHolmurot's children are already no longer small and it's his dream that they study in an institute of higher education.  Because of this, he and his wife are developing their business and saving money for their children's education.  After all, if they get a higher education, they'll be able to work in dignified profession.  \r\n\r\nHolmurot is planning to use this loan to buy livestock feed because he is out of feed and there is no forage in the winter.  He is very grateful to Kiva for the financial help and

Despite his solitude he is a good, hardworking and responsible man. Mamadali has decided not to marry again. \r\n\r\nHe has since childhood worked with fattening cattle, which he learned from his father. He knows this business very well. Currently he has one calf and one dairy cow. He milks the cow himself and every day sells 10 liters of milk to his neighbors and acquaintances. \r\n\r\nMamadali also works with buying and reselling cattle. Cattle breeding is Mamadali's only income. For the loan, Mamadali plans to purchase livestock and fatten until spring, to sell at a favorable price. After having saved up money he would like to refurbish his house in the summer, as the house is currently in bad conditions. Mamadali expresses his thankfulness to the Kiva organization for the financial help and support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1293113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

They raise cattle because this business is well-suited for the mountains.  In the mountainous regions, animal husbandry is people's main source of income and Mavluda has been doing this since she was young.  She also spins yarn from the wool of her sheep and goats, which she sells to wholesale buyers.\r\n\r\nMavluda's husband often travels to the Russian Federation to earn extra money, but it's not very much.  Because of this, they need to expand their business of raising cattle.  Mavluda is trying very hard to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nShe is taking out this loan in order to buy young goats and sheep.  In the spring, when cattle gets more expensive, she hopes to sell them for a better price.

She was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has 2 years of primary school education. She started working together with ACB in 2012 and is on her first loan cycle. She will use the loan requested to rent a field, pay the labourers and buy seeds. Donathile anticipates only one problem which could prevent repayment of the loan; climate change. In order to increase her business, her strategy is to use chemical fertilizers. As far as her farming business is concerned, her ambition is to have her own field. Her ambition for her family is to make sure her children are educated at university level and to ensure her family's well-being. As well as farming, she also sells various items to retail customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1295377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to rent a field, buy seeds and pay the labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2013-02-18T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-20T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umutesi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leocadie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donathille","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie Claire","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consol\u00e9e","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":930000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":930000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":930000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-31T08:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":937611.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390479437}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T13:29:31Z","paid_date":"2013-08-31T08:32:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":528657,"name":"Tuya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Tuya, 38-years-old, lives with her family in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

Katima is located 10km away from his hometown of Sesheke. The loan will help him to pay for rentals, hire new staff and have working capital. Matokwani is very excited to be taking out his second loan, and he is quick to say that his business improved greatly when he received his first loan. This is because he was able to serve more customers who wanted to send and receive money from his shop. \r\n\r\nWhen asked how the first loan impacted his family life, he says that because he was able to serve more customers, he made more profits so he was able to help his niece with her school fees without feeling too much pressure.\r\n\r\nMatokwani sees this as one more step toward realizing his dream of running a big business that makes life easy for his customers by delivering services efficiently without having to keep them waiting. He thanks the Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1215828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To open a second mobile money transfer shop in the nearby border town of Katima.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Sesheke","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2013-02-18T12:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-20T12:50:01Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matokwani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":544.17,"local_amount":2864.03,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T21:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2881.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355983452},{"amount":522.01,"local_amount":2747.42,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T13:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364677515},{"amount":558.54,"local_amount":2939.66,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T13:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2957.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373062102},{"amount":275.28,"local_amount":1448.89,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1457.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381854152}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T00:32:13Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:24:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":528684,"name":"Celerina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celerina is 48 years old and lives in Dela Paz, Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte.

The family runs an agricultural business and cultivates family-owned land, growing nuts and maize. The harvested products are sold at the local open market. \r\n\r\nDavid requested a loan for starting up a trading business. His loan requests were rejected each time because he did not meet income requirements and he lacks experience in new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nBut David\u2019s loan request was approved by Credo, as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-ups and re-startups. The program extends soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, David will cover the costs of purchasing his initial inventory of basic groceries for starting a grocery store. He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually. Another part of the credit will be used for purchasing a milk cow. After the cow is bought, the family will produce cheese with the milk and sell it from their grocery store. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. David will work hard, and he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family. With this loan, his family will generate enough income to access regular, available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market in the event they need it in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1296564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Sadaqat has 25 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father who taught him well how to look after cattle. \r\n\r\nSadaqat usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them in five to six months, and resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar.  Milk and yogurt he sells to the neighbors. Milk and meat-selling brings AZN 100 income per month. \r\n\r\nMilk and yogurt, as well as meat, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolma and always use yogurt sauce. Milk products are considered to be very healthy and also present in everyday life.   \r\n\r\nThis is the only financial income in his family and it is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children. Sadaqat applied for a loan of AZN 1,100 to purchase one milk cow and two cattle. He is a trustworthy client and this will be his fourth loan.

They have their own home in a farm outbuilding.  She is cheerful and charismatic, qualities which make her work more bearable.  Her main business is agriculture and she has ten years' experience of growing peas, beans, potatoes, corn and vegetables.  \"My land is quite a distance away, so it takes me about half an hour to get there\" she observes.  In spite of this, every morning, Luzmila, with her customary perseverance, goes very happily to tend her crops, with the help of her husband and farm labourers who help at harvest time.  While this is going on, she goes to sell her produce at the wholesale market in Tarma.  Over the last year, her children have made more demands on her for school-related materials and so Luzmila has turned to her communal bank to cover her main needs.  This month is important as she has to do some planting and spread fertiliser on some crops, as well as having to begin sowing.  She is a member of the \"Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay\" communal bank and this would be her sixth loan with MFP.  So strongly does Luzmila feel part of the bank that she has become its treasurer and, for that reason, she guarantees that she will make her repayments punctually.  She will spend the 1500 soles on seeds and fertiliser to begin growing corn, oats and peas.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1296856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertiliser","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-18T16:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-20T16:30:19Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863838}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T18:32:07Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":528747,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is 30 years old and is now applying for a loan of $1,000 to improve her business.

In addition to the food she also does farming. She needs a loan with which to buy cases of beverages. Buying in bulk will allow her to buy at a considerable discount, and she wants to build up a good stock of beverages as the demand for cold beverages is high.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1296617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy beverages in wholesale quantities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Msambweni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":164,"posted_date":"2013-02-18T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-20T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rukia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T21:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1696.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355969412},{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":2975.84,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T13:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3029.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364670846},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":4524.13,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T13:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4605.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373055511},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1607.12,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1635.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381846169},{"amount":29.24,"local_amount":2506.25,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2551.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399949809},{"amount":20.07,"local_amount":1720,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T22:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1750.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419996099}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T17:27:46Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T22:26:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":528930,"name":"Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jesus vive en casa propia con su esposa en la zona de Sopocachi de la ciudad de La Paz.\n\nJesus, de profesi\u00f3n administrador de empresas, percibe una renta de jubilado de una de las escuelas culinarias donde trabajo durante muchos a\u00f1os;

As the main source of income for her family, Chynar has worked with livestock since the year 2000.  She began her business with the sum of 20,000 KGS.  Thanks to her guidance, today the business has 4 cows and 10 sheep, and brings in around 10,000 KGS a month from the sale of dairy products.  With the goal of growing her business further, Chynar has turned to the company Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase calves and a milk cow.  Chynar plans to use the profits from the loan to further expand her livestock.  She also plans to build a shed.

She is living on her own. \r\n\r\nNawale has been working as a private teacher since 2010. She likes her profession because she feels that she is helping learners to get the needed education. She started teaching from home until she decided to apply for a loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l. to arrange a special teaching room and equip it with the needed supplies. \r\n\r\nNawale notes that these purchases will facilitate her work preparation, allowing her to expand her research and studies. She is very optimistic about her future and wishes to receive more students with the coming school season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1296664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to arrange a special teaching room and equip it with the needed supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":115,"posted_date":"2013-02-18T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-20T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nawale","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":166.66,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-20T08:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347200144},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355944094},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364664233},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-22T08:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373049554},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-25T08:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840753},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698999},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399945215},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":166.66,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419992089},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644781},{"amount":83.37,"local_amount":83.37,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439878190}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T19:28:30Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":528787,"name":"Jamirah's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamirah's group is composed of two hardworking women.

The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale.

She hopes that in the future, she will be able to build rental houses of her own. \r\n\r\nJamirah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. He has been working as an electrician at a private business entity for five consecutive years. His wife also works at the same company he does. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some interior repair and insulation, so he is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase construction and insulation materials such as fiberglass, cement and bricks and dry board, etc. As a result, the family will be able to live in a comfortable and warm place. More importantly, the insulated house will enable the family to burn less coal during wintertime, thus greatly contributing to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better life.

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal) and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seeds and fertilizers. This enables a borrower to grow more crops to be sold in the local market, allowing households to move beyond subsistence. This loan will provide much-needed cash income throughout the

","en":"Begayim is the 49-year-old mother of four children.  Two of these four children are grown.  Begayim has received a higher education, and is, by nature, a quiet, decent, and courteous woman.  She has been a source of income for her family for 30 years, earning money through her livestock.  She began her business with 10,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work perseverance, she now brings in around 20,000 KGS a month, and has one cow and eight ewes.    Additionally, Begayim cultivates four hectares of land, growing corn, cotton, and vegetables.  With the goal of further growing her business, Begayim has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 KGS to buy high-quality seeds and fertilizers so she can maximize her harvest.  She plans to reinvest the income from the loan back into her business.

Selling milk and dairy products earns him 300 GEL per month.\r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan to purchase an additional milk cow and feed for his cattle. After the cattle are fed properly, they will produce lots of milk. The family will then be able to produce more dairy products and sell them for a good price.

They come from Sauce in the northern part of the country, a place characterized by milk, junket and cheese production. \r\n\r\nThese people are hardworking, responsible and enthusiastic about self-improvement. Regrettably, due to a lack of economic resources, none of them could finish their studies as they were obliged to work from an early age. This is a situation they don't want for their children, so they fight to offer them better opportunities. \r\n\r\nThanks to her spirit and desire to succeed, the coordinator of the 'Bello Amanecer' communal bank is Juana Guillermina. She works in a pulper\u00eda [grocery store] located in her home. A pulper\u00eda is a small shop that sells grocery products in small quantities like sachets of shampoo, packets of coffee, bread, eggs, beans, sugar, milk, rice, oil, and tiste [a soft drink made from toasted cornflour].

Her husband died ten years ago in a bus accident, which claimed many lives along the Kampala highway. After her husband\u2019s death, life became miserable to the extent that Doreen could not afford tuition for her fatherless children. The situation worsened when her father-in-law tried to marry her and when she refused, he took all the cows her husband left her with. Because of the situation, she started up a food stall in the market with a little capital acquired from her mother to enable her to look after her family.

These members are from Malpaisillo, a community located in the western region of the country characterized by its hardworking and responsible people who have fought hard to get ahead in life. Unfortunately, none of the members of this group were able to complete their studies for lack of resources that forced them to work from a very early age.

Reyna's routine is to work 10 hours a day, work that she performs with much pleasure as it has been able to support her and her children. The goal of this loan is to invest in more ingredients such as milk and plastic bags; in the near future she would like to improve her income. \r\n\r\nThe communal bank \"Las Ovejas de Cristo\" appreciates the support that Kiva investors bring to people with scarce resources in poor countries such as Nicaragua. It enables them to improve their businesses, work, and have their own dignified sources of income.

Besides cacao, his main source of income, Albino also plants peanuts for sale in the local market.\n\nAlbino got into cacao farming at the same time of a new market for cacao introduced by the local coop.  Albino\u2019s favorite part of cacao farming is harvesting because it is the easiest task concerning cacao and is done under the shade of cacao and timber trees. \u201cThe challenging part for me is the cleaning, because it has to be done every three months,\u201d says Albino.\n\nThe family is requesting the loan to clean their cacao farm and the surroundings. Cleaning is the process of removing the underbrush to open airflow in the field and so that it could be accessible for harvest. Cacao trees require shade, so they are grown literally in the jungle, making cleaning a necessary ingredient for its cultivation.

Cleaning is the process of removing overgrown bushes on the cacao and the buffer zone to make it accessible for harvesting. Pruning is the removal of unproductive branches and helps increase yields per acre in the coming season by allowing the plant to direct energy to producing pods, which grow directly on the tree trunk.

and Rosenda are from the village of San Jose, Toledo\u2019s cacao village extraordinaire. The couple has raised seven children, aged five months to 16 years. Three of the children are currently enrolled in school, and all but one still live in with the family. \n\nThe family manages a small farm of an acre and a half, with around 600 cacao trees. Luciano started to plant some years ago encouraged by the local cooperative, the market opportunity for cacao and his brothers\u2019 advice to start cultivating the crop. It was a great decision, he says, because cacao is \u201cthe number one cash crop.\u201d He\u2019s excited about cacao not only for its stable income-generating potential but also because it is a long-term crop that continues to produce pods for decades after it is planted. Luciano\u2019s favorite part of cacao farming is seeing the field clean: \u201cit looks really good!\u201d The cleaning itself, however, is less fun because it requires hard work and takes up a lot of time. Cacao grows in the middle of lush jungle, meaning the farmers have to constantly fight underbrush growth to keep the trees healthy and accessible. \n\nBesides growing cacao, Luciano cultivates corn among other crops for home use. He is also currently in the Belize Defense Force, which he hopes he can retire from in two years to then fully focus on his farm. In the next few years, the family hopes to renovate their home to better accommodate the growing family. Luciano says the family plans to support the children in achieving the furthest education levels they have reason to want to pursue, but will also extend a helping hand if they instead choose to go into farming. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan for cleaning their 600 cacao trees as well as bagging 500 seeds and lining the land for a planned expansion. Once bagged, cacao seeds take about six months to grow into a seedling that is ready for transplantation into the ground. Lining is the process of planning and marking the spots where seedlings will be planted to ensure a linear structure and sufficient spacing. The loan will pay for the equivalent of 30 days of hired labor in the community. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1297183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To clean and expand cacao farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":86.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971168},{"amount":93.88,"local_amount":178.81,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":186.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751693},{"amount":43.78,"local_amount":83.39,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993434},{"amount":43.79,"local_amount":83.4,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255603},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":82.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":86.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136444},{"amount":51.35,"local_amount":97.8,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":102.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900661},{"amount":43.82,"local_amount":83.47,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":87.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088542},{"amount":29.8,"local_amount":56.8,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673281},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":86.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144107},{"amount":87.52,"local_amount":166.7,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":174.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467959958}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T04:27:17Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:26:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":529078,"name":"Casamiro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Casamiro, age 45, lives in the village of San Jose, in the foothills of the Maya Mountains.

For Casamiro cacao farming is good because it helps him take care of his family. \u201cGood. It\u2019s good because I sell the fruit, it helps me,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao in perfect English, his second language after Maya Mopan. Apart from cacao, the family also plants coffee, ginger, beans, corn, rice and vegetables for home use.\n\nThe favorite part of cacao for Casamiro is pruning. Prunning is the removal of the nonproductive branches and results in increased yields for the next year\u2019s crop by letting the tree focus on producing pods that grow directly on the trunk. The more challenging part for Casamiro is cleaning, because a farmer cannot finish it on their own and have to hire outside help. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to clean their two acres of cacao farm and to establish a nursery for a planned cacao farm expansion. Cleaning is the removal of underbrush to facilitate airflow and keep trees accessible for pruning and harvesting. The family will establish a nursery where they will have the young cacao seedling grow until it\u2019s ready for transplanting. Seedlings are typically strong enough for transplantation when they have four leaves, and take about six months to grow to that stage. The tasks at hand will require and create the equivalent of 18 days of labor in the community.

age 58,  lives in the village of San Jose, where he has been farming cacao for over 30 years. San Jose, a village with almost the entire population of cacao farmers, rests in the foothills of the Maya mountains. Isidoro and his wife Modesta have raised eight children, with the youngest still in school. The family owns six acres of cacao planted by Isidoro 30 years back. Besides cacao the family also grows corn and rice for home use.\nIsidoro got into cacao because it is a permanent crop that doesn\u2019t require replanting every year. \u201cMy favorite part of cacao is the harvesting because I know that I am going to collect some money very soon\u201d says Isidoro. The challenging part of cacao for him is the birds, as they damage ripe pods and create production loss. \n The family is requesting this loan to hire help clean their cacao farm. Cleaning is the removal of the overgrown bush in the cacao farm and its surroundings to make it accessible for pruning and harvesting. Part of the loan will also be used for hiring people from the village to help with harvesting. Mature cacao trees need to be harvested every one to two weeks during peak cacao season, the months January to May. The task at hand will require the equivalent of 25 workdays for cleaning and two workdays every two weeks for harvesting. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1297193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To hire help with cacao farm cleaning and harvest ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isidoro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":45.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098951},{"amount":23.95,"local_amount":43.54,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":47.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971170},{"amount":23.61,"local_amount":42.93,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":46.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751695},{"amount":26.47,"local_amount":48.13,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993436},{"amount":178.05,"local_amount":323.73,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":354.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255605}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T04:02:25Z","paid_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":528917,"name":"C20012 Kopaki Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vincent is 47 years old, married, and has two children, 8 and 12 years old.

He grew up without his father because his mother was neglected by her husband at an early age. Because of such circumstance, he grew up with his mother, and they have been doing business trading goats on a small scale to earn a living. Due to their hard work, they expanded, and he was able to acquire the land where they constructed a semi-permanent house 15 years ago.

She received a higher education and, by character, she's respectable and has integrity.  She works with livestock as a source of income for her family.  She began her business in 2003 with 20,000 KGS.  In her care, the business has grown and she now earns around 10,000 KGS a month from reselling cattle.  To date, Damira has two milk cows and ten goats.  The income from her business allows her to pay tuition for the education her sons receive in university.  With the goal of further developing her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a sum of 60,000 KGS to buy twelve sheep.  Damira plans to reinvest the expected additional income back into her business to expand the number of cattle she owns, as well as to continue paying for her sons'
