family. When his parents passed on, he carried on with the parents\u2019 agriculture business of banana planting and livestock to earn a living and support his siblings. Livingstone and his wife have a family of four (4) children of which three attend school.\r\n\r\nLivingstone started a salon business in 2010 which serves ladies only at the moment. The business went on getting clients and reached a time when the resources were not enough to serve their clients. In 2012 Livingstone wanted to expand his business and decided to join UGAFODE Microfinance Limited (MDI) for financial assistance. He got a loan which assisted him to buy more driers and hair oils to meet the demand of his customers, and that increased his income.

(Font for Development) 1, 2 & 3. They are micro-businesspeople who sell clothes, natural products, shoes, artisan crafts, etc. They are in the city of Samana, a tourist town in development. Their town is still rural but is a great natural escape, and these borrowers use this to sell their products to people visiting their town.\r\n\r\nJuana is a mother of two children. She lives with them in her simple and rural home structure. Juana is very excited to be receiving her fifth loan from Esperanza International. She has successfully paid off her previous loans and taken steps to grow her business. She started her business almost six years ago.

Since 2000 Azizahon has been doing animal husbandry and field crop cultivation. A business which she stated with an amount of 20,000 som (KGS) and at this time has twenty heads of sheep brings in about 15,000 KGS a month from resale of cattle. Azizahan has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 120,000 som.

Una familia agricultora que viven en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, su nombre es Nanegalito, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Un medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos a pesar de que fue una zona que en el pasado no fue muy tomada en cuenta.\nFany desde hace un a\u00f1o se dedica a la crianza de pollos y gallinas para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n y adem\u00e1s la producci\u00f3n de huevos. Fany no se dej\u00f3 vencer de los obst\u00e1culos a pesar de que en un emprendimiento anterior, tuvo una p\u00e9rdida muy significativa de recursos econ\u00f3micos. Ahora paralelamente a los quehaceres de su hogar se dedica 8 horas cada d\u00eda a alimentar sus animales, limpiar los criaderos, vender los pollos, etc. A Fany le es muy dif\u00edcil conseguir recursos cuando se ha quedado sin alimento para sus aves y para no sufrir este temor ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de balanceado al por mayor para as\u00ed suplir las necesidades alimenticias de sus aves por algunos meses y adem\u00e1s comprar m\u00e1s aves que le permitan incrementar su negocio y sus clientes. Fany sue\u00f1a con tener junto a su familia una calidad de vida superior a la que ella tuvo y que sus hijos puedan educarse hasta conseguir una profesi\u00f3n que los lleve lejos. Esta mujer sin duda esforzada, agradece a todos quienes alrededor del mundo aportan con un granito de arena para su crecimiento personal y por supuesto agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa que con el apoyo de Kiva le ha podido brindar la facilidad de obtener este capital. ","en":"Fany, 34, grew up in a country home with scarce economic resources, but with the help of her parents she was able to get an elementary education which has helped her through work all her life.  She moved away from home with her common-law husband, Alfredo, and they have three children, a 10-year-old, a 7-year-old and a baby girl, 7 months old.  They are a farming family and live in a rural community called Nanegalito in Quito, Ecuador.  The town is located northwest of the province of Pichincha, the residence of an Ecuadorean culture.  It is a place with a diversity of flora and fauna and pristine rivers and waterfalls that attract national and foreign tourists.  One of the main business activities in the area is farming, including milk and meat production, as well as crop farming of sugar cane, yucca plant, corn, oranges, tangerines and papayas.  Artisan handicrafts are also important here and in much demand because of their natural materials such as forest seeds.  All of this has motivated the local authorities to install adequate facilities so the more than 3,000 inhabitants can have access to basic services despite the fact that the area was never given consideration in the past.\r\n\r\nFor a year now, Fany has been raising chickens and hens that she later sells, along with eggs.  Fany never has let obstacles get in her way, despite the fact that in her pervious business she suffered a significant economic loss.  Now, in addition to her household chores, she spends eight hours a day feeding the animals, cleaning their pens, selling chicken, etc.  \r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for Fany to obtain resources when she runs out of animal feed, so in order not to run the risk she is requesting a loan to buy wholesale balanced feed to have enough on hand for a few months.  She will also buy more chicken to increase business and her customer base.  \r\n\r\nFany's goal is to give her family a better quality of life than her own.  She wants her children to get an education so they can become successful professionals.  This hard-working woman is grateful to people around the world who contribute toward her personal growth.  Of course, she is algo grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa which, with Kiva's support, has made the loan possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1297078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nanegalito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T09:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T09:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fany Neli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":747.04,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":59.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":61.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.29,"local_amount":50.09,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068721},{"amount":57.49,"local_amount":57.26,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":57.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524912},{"amount":59.02,"local_amount":58.79,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":59.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133216},{"amount":59.77,"local_amount":59.54,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313754},{"amount":61.3,"local_amount":61.05,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":61.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565361},{"amount":62.16,"local_amount":61.92,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":62.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814402},{"amount":399.97,"local_amount":398.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":399.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320578}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T13:08:48Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":529001,"name":"Sah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sah is 29 years old and lives in Jacob Town.

This project has been a profitable one and the only source of income for the family, but from time to time it needs more support to cover the cost.\r\n\r\nAmneh is requesting a USD Murabaha loan to help her husband cover the cost of purchasing more types of herbs.\r\nThis will increase sales and increase the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has 7 children and has been farming for 17 years. Her primary income sources are milk, and crops. She will use the loan from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nShe stated that what is most enjoyable about farming is milking the cows to get milk for sale and for the family's consumption! Her biggest challenge is when the animals go dry, there's no earning from it, and one has to find an alternative source of income.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSusan hopes to have more customers and dreams of giving her children a good life.  She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is 43 years old, married and has 4 children, the eldest of whom is 14 years old and the youngest, 8. All of his children attend school and he is responsible for no other people. He was born in Rwanda and has 5 years of secondary school education. He started to work with ACB Ltd in 2008 and is on his 3rd loan cycle. The previous loans have been correctly repaid.\r\n\r\nHe will use the current loan to rent a field, buy seeds and pay the labourers. The one difficulty which Bonaventure foresees could cause non-repayment of this loan is climate change, which can cause a poor harvest. In order to increase his agricultural output, his strategy is to use modern farming methods, notably by using chemical fertilizers and going to look for markets for his harvest. He will also buy his own field. His business ambition is to become a professional farmer. Concerning his family, he will continue to ensure their well-being. As well as the activity being financed, he also sells various items to retail customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1295978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to rent a field, buy seeds and pay the labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alphonsine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Odette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonaventure","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alphonsine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Euphrasie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperance","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wensislas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jean De Dieu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":1450000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1637.44,"local_amount":1032300,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-31T08:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1036683.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390479441},{"amount":345.32,"local_amount":217700,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-08T09:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":218624.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399734846},{"amount":317.24,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-07T10:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":200849.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429418538}],"funded_date":"2013-02-20T03:35:13Z","paid_date":"2014-01-07T10:11:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":529131,"name":"Ratna Sari Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ratna Sari group is continuing their loans.

and is married with three children.  Her eldest son helps her around the farm, and her two younger children work in Moscow and send money home to their mother.  Urnisa has been raising raising livestock and keeping bees as a source of income for her family since 1998.  She started this business with 1,000 som (KGS).  On her farm today, Urnisa has six sheep, five cows, one horse and ten beehives, all of which bring in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month through the sale of livestock and honey.  With the goal of developing her business further, Ulrisa turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow and sugar for her bees.  She plans to reinvest the income from this loan into developing her business

She runs a small store and a hog raising business for income. From her store, she gains about 7,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) each month. The money goes to school fees, daily meals, bills at home, and also feed for her hogs. She was very determined in achieving good sales; that is why she is now asking for a loan of 25,000 PHP to buy canned goods, noodles, eggs, biscuits, sugar, coffee, and bread to sell in her store. It will help attract more customers to buy her products; therefore, her income will also increase.\r\n\r\nWith determination and patience in developing her business, Graciela will continue to generate good profits in order to establish a successful business for her family.

He has been farming for 4 years. His primary income sources are milk, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Milking the cow for milk production!' His biggest challenge, he says, is that he lacks funds to diversify his agriculture ventures. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Browny and Nyeusi.\r\n\r\nJoseph was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied that he heard about Juhudi from a relative. This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. He learned 'how one can use microfinance loans to do business, especially agri-business.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Joseph replied, 'I will start poultry keeping with the intent of producing and selling eggs, thus increasing income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Joseph owns a cow but does not own poultry, a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

","en":"Abdukayum is 35 years old and is married with two children.  His children are still in school and his wife works in a cafeteria as a dishwasher.  Abdukayum works in the building trade, but everything that he and his wife earn together goes to pay for their living expenses.  A few months ago, they started to build a home, but they had to halt construction due to lack of funds.  The one solid source of income in the family is cattle raising.  Abdukayum has been involved in this line of work practically since childhood.  He knows all the advantages of this line of work.  His plan is to increase his business so he can use the income to finally finish the work on his home.  His wife also helps him in this task.  At the moment, the feed for the animals is running out since it is winter, there is hardly any grass anywhere.  This is why Abdukayum has turned to Arvand for financial support.  He plans to use his loan to buy feed for his animals.  He sends his thanks to Arvand, because it is through the assistance of their organization that people in need of financial help can fulfill their plans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1293731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also has a food stall for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 16,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nCristita hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams that her business will grow bigger.

is 33 years old. He is married and lives with his wife and two children in a small village of Marneuli district. The family runs an agricultural business and has milk cows and calves. They produce cheese with the milk and sell it locally.\r\n\r\nThe main income for the family is his newly started grocery store, selling different types of groceries. It has been a profitable project, but also needs more support to further develop. Several times he has asked for loans from local financial institutions to develop his business, but without success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of their low income. \r\n\r\nFamil\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Famil will cover the cost of purchasing needed stock of basic groceries that customers often request. He plans to increase the turnover in his business gradually. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Famil will work hard, and he will be able to improve living conditions for his family. With this loan, his family will generate enough income to access regular available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event that they need it and also Famil will renovate his house which is old and damaged.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":1297479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He now works for a state-owned company where he has worked for a number of years, primarily building homes for people with low resources. \r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for a loan in order to pay for university coursework so that he is better prepared and up-to-date with industry technology. The coursework is very expensive and he cannot cover the cost with his salary alone.

She will use the loan to buy a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi Kilimo's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Annah owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle,' but does not own: 'pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards, based on this loan.

que sus padres ten\u00edan pocos recursos econ\u00f3micos y tuvo la necesidad de apoyarlos, por ello solo pudo estudiar hasta el quinto grado de secundaria, pero le hubiera gustado poder estudiar la carrera de Ingenier\u00eda Civil. \n\nD\u00eda a d\u00eda Julio trabaja como obrero agr\u00edcola y tambi\u00e9n tiene una parcela en la que actualmente ha sembrado tuna, el cual es una especie de cactus que tiene frutos de varios colores y son muy agradables, asimismo los ha infestado de cochinilla, la cual es una especie de insecto que vive en este tipo de plantas y del cual se obtiene una especie de tinte natural; \u00e9l cree que est\u00e1 saliendo adelante con su trabajo porque es responsable y sobre todo porque le gusta lo que \u00e9l hace.\n\nJulio est\u00e1 muy agradecido con los

attractions.  He is a very hardworking man who, from a very young age, learned to earn his daily bread with the sweat of his own brow, since his parents had few economic resources and he had to support them.  Therefore, he was only able to study until the age of 16, although he would have liked to study Civil Engineering.  \n\nJulio works as a farm labourer every day and also has a plot of land on which he has sown tuna, a kind of cactus whose fruit is multi-coloured and very attractive.  Furthermore, his plants have become infested with mealy bugs, a type of insect which lives on these types of plants and from which a kind of natural dye is obtained.  \n\nJulio believes that he is achieving success with his business because he is responsible and, above all, because he likes what he does.

The loan funds will be used to buy more passion fruits for making juice, soda, and water. This investment will help Mary generate greater profits, which she will use to support her family. \r\n\r\nMary hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nMary is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1297504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

Her biggest challenge is 'loosing an animal due to illness\".The animal in the farm is named 'Murgusi.'\r\n\r\nVeronica was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Knew about Juhudi from a daughter in the group.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How to increase assets like dairy cows through getting financed by Juhudi.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Veronica replied 'Purchase a cow; thus more milk production.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Veronica owns the following: 'cow' but does not own 'pig, poultry, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

She buys the cattle to raise in the fairs in the neighboring areas, which average about 10 kilometers from her house.\r\n\r\nThe loan she's requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy three cattle to raise.  The main need to satisfy is to be able to buy her cattle herd to raise because she has an appropriate plot of land for this activity and the cattle will have adequate pasture for raising.  \r\n\r\nAfter she buys the three cattle, her main idea is to sell them later.  With the profit she earns from this activity she'll continue increasing her herd because she's always working with loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo and she'll keep on investing her profits in her business.\r\n\r\nShe wants to continue raising cattle and diversify her products.  She also mentioned that she wants to grow corn and beans because the winter is approaching and it's favorable for these activities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1297815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy three cattle to raise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133780}],"funded_date":"2013-02-20T10:51:26Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:27:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":529344,"name":"Teddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teddy is a single mother of four children, and all her children go to school.

Only the youngest one is in school. The rest are working. She started her business after separating from the father of her children. She had to move from one region to a town in Chinandega in search of work. She needed to support her children, since she was a single mother with no support from anybody and due to her children, she was unable to find work. But with the help of a good samaritan who gathered corn and offered her this product on credit, she started her tortilla business. With time, she was able to start another small business - selling clothing as a street vendor. Now she has been in this business for 13 years. Even though she was not able to help her children with their professional studies, they finished secondary school and learned to work for themselves. This is not the first time she has asked for credit through our institution. She has an excellent credit record, because she has been very determined. This investment will help her have the necessary ingredients to make her tortillas and invest capital in her clothing sales business.

The loan will be used to buy hair cosmetics to treat more clients, and will help Judith to generate greater profits, meet her family's basic needs and save some money for future use. Judith hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nJudith is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

siendo muy joven  emigr\u00f3 en busca de un mejor futuro a la Sierra ecuatoriana. Ahora vive con su pareja Iv\u00e1n de 34 a\u00f1os con quien tiene 2 hijos de 14 y 6 a\u00f1os, ambos estudian y tambi\u00e9n ayudan en las labores de la casa. Son una familia muy unida y viven en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, su nombre es Nanegalito, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas. Su punto fuerte en la producci\u00f3n es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos que hasta hace poco no era un beneficio que todos gozaban.\nDiana lleg\u00f3 a Nanegalito ayudando a su pareja en el campo, cultivando varios tipos de frutos y tambi\u00e9n cuidando animales para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n. Al ver la necesidad en su hogar, hace un a\u00f1o ella tambi\u00e9n decidi\u00f3 asumir el reto de criar cerdos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, aunque en una ocasi\u00f3n ya lo hab\u00eda intentado y no result\u00f3 como ella esperaba, no se ha dado por vencida.  Mejorando los criaderos y ocupando casi 10 horas al cuidado de los cerdos, Diana ha incrementado sus ingresos y ahora requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un par de cerdos adicionales para criarlos y as\u00ed poder salir al mercado con m\u00e1s producto para cumplir con la demanda de los visitantes de la zona que siempre van en busca de lo mejor. Diana sue\u00f1a con tener junto a su familia un futuro prometedor, convertirse en una microempresaria reconocida, para lo cual est\u00e1 adquiriendo varias herramientas gracias a la asesor\u00eda de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa  y su ejecutivo de cuenta, en donde encontr\u00f3 el apoyo y confianza para tener un capital a trav\u00e9s del producto Kiva en donde adem\u00e1s ella consigue que sus proyectos de vida sean apoyados en todo el mundo. ","en":"Diana is a 29 year old woman who was born in a a home in the Costa Region, and emigrated to the Ecuadorian Sierra when she was very young in search of a better future. Now she lives with her partner, 34-year-old Iv\u00e1n, with whom she has two children, ages 14 and 6. They both study and also help with house work. They are a very united family and they live in a rural parish in the city of Quito, capitol of the province of Ecuador. The name of the parish is Nanegalito, located northwest of the Pichincha Province, which was the home of an Ecuadorian culture.\r\n\r\nThis place possesses a variety of flora and fauna, and also has rivers and waterfalls. Its strong point in production is cattle, with the production of milk and meat, as well as agriculture, with the production of sugar cane stalks, yucca, corn, oranges, tangerines and papayas. Hand crafts are also a business opportunity in the area, in demand for their particular use of natural materials such as seeds from the forest. Due to all of this, the local authorities have made it a point to do appropriate installations so that all of their over 3,000 inhabitants have access to basic services, which up until recently were not a benefit that all were able to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhen Diana arrived to Nanegalito she was helping her partner in the field, sowing various types of fruits and also raising animals to be sold. Upon seeing the amount of need in her household, a year ago she decided to also take on the challenge of raising pigs to be sold, even though on one occasion she had already tried and it had not turned out the way she had hoped. She had not given up. Improving the nurseries and spending almost 10 hours taking care of the pigs, Diana has increased her income and now she needs a loan so she can buy a couple of additional pigs to raise and that way she can go to the market with more products to meet the demand of the area's visitors who always go in search of the best.\r\n\r\nDiana dreams of having a promising future along with her family and becoming a recognized micro entrepreneur. For this purpose she is acquiring several tools, thanks to the advice of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and its account executive. Via Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, she found the support and trust to gain capital through the Kiva product, and this is where she also got her life's projects supported around the world."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1297160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy pigs and supplies for raising them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nanegalito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-02-20T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-22T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Gisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":747.04,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":59.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":61.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.29,"local_amount":50.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494983},{"amount":57.49,"local_amount":57.26,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":57.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524913},{"amount":59.02,"local_amount":58.79,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":59.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133217},{"amount":59.77,"local_amount":59.54,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313755},{"amount":61.3,"local_amount":61.05,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":61.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565362},{"amount":62.16,"local_amount":61.92,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":62.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814403},{"amount":399.97,"local_amount":398.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":399.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320579}],"funded_date":"2013-02-20T05:06:59Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jamie Schau","image":1143325}},{"id":529353,"name":"Everline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everline lives in the Nyamira area of Kenya, which is a popular banana growing region.

She started her own business with her husband in 1996.  Despite the struggles of life, she remains lively and cheerful.  She strongly believes in a bright future for her family.  In order to provide a source of income for her family, Kairiniza makes her living working with livestock.  She began her business with 10,000 KGS.  Thanks to perseverance and hard work, the business now brings in 7,000 KGS a month.  Kairiniza also cultivates two hectares of land each year, raising beans and perennial grasses.  With the goal of further developing her business, Kairiniza has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 KGS to buy two bulls.  She plans to use the profits from the loan to expand the amount of land she cultivates and to increase the number of cattle she owns.  She dreams that her children will have good jobs and good families in the future.

She is still selling secondhand clothes as her primary business, and she started offering photocopying services as a secondary business. This increased her monthly income to 30,000 Kenyan shillings, which she has been using to support her family. Her business did well and she was able to repay the previous loan with much ease.

Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por los negocios que ofertan deportes extremos que a simple vista se puede ver que son manufacturados con mucha seguridad e ingenio. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos a pesar de que fue una zona que en el pasado no fue muy tomada en cuenta, pues hasta hace poco, muchos no gozaban el beneficio de tener agua potable o luz el\u00e9ctrica. Aqu\u00ed vive Estela, una mujer de 38 a\u00f1os que cada d\u00eda se levanta con la esperanza de ver sus sue\u00f1os hechos realidad, entre ellos el de ver a su hijo que actualmente tiene 19 a\u00f1os, convertido en un profesional de excelencia. Estela vive con su pareja Rafael de 44 a\u00f1os quien ha sido de gran apoyo. \nEstela desde hace 8 a\u00f1os se dedica a la crianza de ganado para producir leche y productos l\u00e1cteos y cuando el caso lo amerita la venta de los animales. Trabaja hasta doce horas diarias cuidando, aseando y sacando la leche de las vacas. La ayuda de su pareja es muy importante para ella y ahora est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 una \u201cvacona\u201d que es el nombre que se les da a las vacas que est\u00e1n pre\u00f1adas. Esto con el objetivo de producir tanto por medio de la vaca como tambi\u00e9n con su ternero. Estela se ha encontrado con varios obst\u00e1culos al querer obtener un capital, pues las garant\u00edas que ella ofrec\u00eda no eran suficientes, sin embargo, cuando se le pregunta a ella que es lo que la motiv\u00f3 a obtener el cr\u00e9dito con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, ella responde, que la convenci\u00f3 la agilidad y confianza que brindan adem\u00e1s del apoyo al sector rural, que brinda a trav\u00e9s del producto de Kiva con el cual adem\u00e1s muchas personas alrededor del mundo le ayudar\u00e1n a su crecimiento laboral. ","en":"In a rural parish in the city of Quito, Ecuador's capital, after following the dusty paths and breathing the country's pure air, we arrive at Nanegalito, a parish located to the northwest of Pichincha province.  This was the home of an Ecuadorean culture and it still holds some hidden stories of Ecuador's past.  This is a place with diverse flora and fauna, and clear rivers and waterfalls that attract both domestic and international visitors.  Businesses offer safe and exciting extreme sporting activities.  Another industry in the area is cattle raising, producing milk and meat, and agriculture, with sugar cane, yucca, reeds, oranges, mandarins and papayas grown here.  Handmade crafts are a also business opportunity here, with natural materials such as seed banks used to produce them.  With all this going on, local authorities worry about having the necessary facilities so that the more than 3000 inhabitants have access to basic services.  Despite this, this was a somewhat forgotten area in the past and until only recently many did not have access to running water or electricity.\r\n\r\nEstela, 38 years old, lives here and every day she wakes up with the hope of seeing her dreams becoming a reality.  These dreams include seeing her son, now 19 years old, become a professional.  Estela lives with her partner, Rafael, who is 44 years old and who has been a big support.  For eight years Estela has been raising cattle in order to produce milk and other dairy products and, when it's worth it, selling the animals.  Estela works 12 hours a day, looking after, washing and milking the cows.  The help from her partner is very important for her and now she is applying for a loan to buy a pregnant cow.  She is doing this with the aim of producing products from both the cow and her calf.  Estela has come across various obstacles while looking for capital.  The guarantees she was offering were not enough but when she is asked what motivated her to seek a loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, she responds that she was convinced of the organisation's agility and their confidence in people.  In addition it supports the rural sector and, through Kiva, many people around the world are helping her in developing her career.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1297839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a pregnant cow to increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nanegalito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-02-20T08:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-22T08:30:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estela Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":417.92,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":45.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":53.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":56.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.47,"local_amount":45.7,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":46.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494984},{"amount":50.91,"local_amount":50.06,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":50.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524914},{"amount":52.12,"local_amount":51.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":52.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133218},{"amount":52.94,"local_amount":52.06,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313756},{"amount":222.56,"local_amount":218.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":222.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565363}],"funded_date":"2013-02-20T11:19:36Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":529391,"name":"Gpf Rewb\u00e9 Golfe Bow Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9e de 35 ans, madame Fatoumata est la pr\u00e9sidente du groupe de cr\u00e9dit appel\u00e9 Rewbe Golfe Bow qui se compose de 5 femmes qui habitent dans le m\u00eame quartier et qui s\u2019activent dans des activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus.

When asked how will this loan benefit your family, Everline replied that it will be easier to pay school fees.\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Everline owns the following a cow, and poultry but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

For the past 2 years, Vanisha has been working hard to manage her drug shop, which sells tablets.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Vanisha has requested a loan of 200000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock more drugs for sell, and will help Vanisha to generate greater profits and expand her business up to the wholesale level. Vanisha hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a house.\r\n\r\nVanisha is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Merab has requested a loan from local financial institutions several time but his loan requests were always rejected because of low income and lack of experience in the new business. His current loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. Merab owns a car and plans to serve the locals as a taxi driver but he will have to charge higher prices for his service because of the benzene (fuel) price is high. Not many citizens can afford to use the taxi service at a higher price. Because of the above mentioned problem, Merab has decided to change his taxi's fuel system from benzene to gas, which is cheaper than benzene and will reduce the cost of transportation by 40 to 45 per cent. It will allow Merab to decrease the price of the service, which will attract more customers. Increasing the number of customers and cutting his costs will positively affect his profit. He will pay a local auto service center to change the fuel system. The increased income will be used for the family\u2019s well

","en":"\u00c1ngela is a 29 year old woman. She grew up in a family with few economic resources. As a result it was not possible for her to continue studying after finishing primary school. She is a single mother. It has been a struggle to provide an education to her child all by herself, but over time she has learned a lot from this experience and her child is now is studying at a public elementary school. \u00c1ngela\u2019s dream is that her child will become a professional. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her young child in the parish of R\u00edo Verde, a place full of history. The parish is located in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province in Ecuador, which has sustained high growth over the past number of years. The most attractive and interesting feature of Santo Domingo city is its delicious fruit and the local gastronomy. The level of business carried out here is also considerable as it has become an inland hub for commercial activity between the country\u2019s mountain and coastal regions. Furthermore, its many tourist attractions and warm climate make it a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists. For this reason, most of the city\u2019s inhabitants are involved in some form of commercial activity or service for local residents and tourists.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela maintains her family, paying the service bills for all their basic needs, such as education, etc. She does this thanks to the business she set up 2 years ago selling cosmetics door to door. She travels the long city streets taking orders from her customers who are mostly women. She works in the morning. In the afternoon she stays at home to help with homework and to do the household chores. But she works at weekends too when she goes, with her child, to her customers\u2019 homes to collect the payments she is owed. \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela wants to grow her business but still attend to her home. For this reason she has requested a loan. She will use this money to renovate a space in her house to serve customers who wish to buy the products she has in stock. In this way she will not lose potential sales when she is at home in the afternoon with her child. \u00c1ngela is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who have advised her and placed their confidence in her.  This has enabled her to take the first step to growing her business. It also motivates people around the world to support those such as \u00c1ngela and to continue giving loans which are so beneficial.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1297917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

Her biggest challenge is 'Poultry farming.'  Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Sero.'\r\n\r\nKwamboka was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Interest rates are favourable.'   This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How to use the loan.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.  When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Kwamboka replied 'Improve my living standards.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.  Kwamboka owns the following: 'cow, poultry, pump, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, bicycle, automobile'.  Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.  This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, sewing machine' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1297703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She works making clothes such as skirts, blouses, dresses, and pants.  She also fixes clothing (using patches).  She does this work with the support of her cousin, who is also a dressmaker.  They used to work for a business, but the owner, for different reasons, closed the company and they decided to start their own business.  They learned this trade from relatives who also work in this trade and have 20 years of experience.  She works from her house and it can be said that her sewing is of high quality.\r\n\r\nShe has agreements with different schools in the area, where she makes them two uniforms per year.  They bring her all the fabric to make the uniforms and she only buys thread, buttons, zippers, plastic decorations for the blouses, etc.  She buys these accessories in stores that are located in the city that is 1 kilometer from her house.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is asking for from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy two new industrial sewing machines.  The main need that she will be able to satisfy with the granting of the loan is to buy two machines, since the ones she has aren't level and don't have the capacity that she requires.  In addition, she will be able to have more time to make more clothing once she buys two machines, if they fulfill her current needs.\r\n\r\nDorian has plans to begin construction on her house in the future.  She has always lived in rented housing and she wants to have her own house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1297840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy two industrial sewing machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-02-20T13:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-22T13:20:01Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dorian Heysil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":68.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":69.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":73.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":74.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":84.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":85.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":87.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":90.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":92.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":97.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356495449}],"funded_date":"2013-02-20T19:22:01Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:31:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":529414,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is 44 years old, married, and has three children.

She is 39 years old, married, and lives with her husband and two sons (12 and 16 years old). Iza\u2019s husband is a contractor soldier and gets a monthly salary. According to government estimations, the family belongs to the 'vulnerable poor' category and gets a small monthly social assistance. The income is hardly enough to cover even food and everyday expenses for the family. \r\n\r\nIza requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for starting a trading business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her job, which is usually demanded by the local credit providers. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, Iza will purchase kitchen utensils and different kinds of household items in capital city open market for wholesale prices and resell them in her town for a profit. It will be hard work for Iza, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the trading business to increase her stock and sales volume. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs in order to improve their living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1297724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase kitchen utensils for starting a trading business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Borjomi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-02-20T13:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-22T13:30:04Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.46},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.46,"local_amount":85.46,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":85.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861431},{"amount":91.77,"local_amount":91.77,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":91.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570236},{"amount":95.44,"local_amount":95.44,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":95.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968868},{"amount":96.89,"local_amount":96.89,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":96.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749286},{"amount":100.53,"local_amount":100.53,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613192},{"amount":1029.91,"local_amount":1029.91,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1029.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856918}],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T13:06:53Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T14:51:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":526359,"name":"Sally","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Sally  is married with four children and all her children go to school.

He is pictured as one of eleven One Acre Fund farmers, nine women and two men. Dunstone is standing on the right with his hand raised. He is receiving an input loan for \u00bd acre of maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. Dunstone first enrolled with One Acre Fund during the 2012 Long Rains and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. Dunstone joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and access the best input prices.\r\n\r\nDunstone reports that before One Acre Fund, he was able to grow about two bags of maize per \u00bd acre, but with his One Acre Fund input loan during Long Rains 2012, he harvested 6 1\/2 bags per 1\/2 acre!

His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

She likes to talk with her customers and learned how to cook from her mother a long time ago. \r\n\r\nBeatrice has requested a loan to buy more fish, bush meat, rice, pepper, charcoal, oil, vita, bowls and cups to increase her customer traffic. In the future she would like to build a house for her children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1297734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict

He is 47 years old. He is married with eight children and two dependents from his uncle, who died four years ago. All his children and dependents are in school. \n\nFrom childhood, Emmanuel has been a farmer and a banana (plantain) seller. In 2008, he learned through a friend of the existence of UGAFODE Micro finance Limited. He was funded with a loan of UGX 1,500,000 which he used to build a semi-permanent house to accommodate his family. \n\nNow, he is requesting for a loan UGX 1,500,000 to buy windows for his house since, in its current state, it is prone to thievery and mosquitoes (see picture attached).

The creams are for face and body and are 100% natural.  She buys them from Temuco and sells them in Curic\u00f3 and Santiago.  She's going to use her loan to buy creams, to put away a little money, and to purchase ingredients for making bread and cakes to sell at the school starting in March.

La Paz Centro is known for its traditional foods and beverages like quesillos [sour cream quesadillas] and tiste [corn and cacao drink].  They are responsible and hardworking women, which they have shown in every way in prior loans.  Unfortunately, due to lack of resources, none of them was able to go to school.\r\n\r\nThanks to their tenacity and desire to get ahead, each has her own business.  Mar\u00eda Magda is the group coordinator and sells footwear and clothing including pants, dresses, shorts, t-shirts, sheet sets, towels, soccer shoes, sneakers, leather shoes, and sandals.  Her routine includes traveling around for ten hours each day with twenty kilos of goods which she offers to current and prospective customers.  She really enjoys running the business because it supports her children.  She is seeking a loan to invest in working capital to stock up her business because in the not-too-distant future she would like to bring in more income.  \r\n\r\nThe \"La Holla y el Comal\"

She is married, with two children, between the ages of 2 years and 15 years. Her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Kadie established her palm oil business. She began her business because she wants to get a permanent source of income. She works at the business six days per week, nine hours per day. She says that the main challenge to her business is sometimes the business is very difficult to operate because of price inflation.\r\n\r\nKadie requires a loan in order to buy more gari and palm oil. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and buy electronic items for her personal use. In the future, Kadie plans to build a house and expand her business. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1297874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
