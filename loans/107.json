It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

E. is a single woman who lives in Sitio San Juan, Brgy. Caradio-an, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and E-load retailer businesses. \r\n\r\nChelistie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Chelistie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her businesses so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her businesses. \r\n\r\nChelistie E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She was married to Mr. Ndifon Augustin and is blessed with five children, two of them are under fifteen years old. They live in a three room apartment in Tumuku quarter in the Belo subdivision. Evelyn received her first loan of 50,000 FCFA from GHAPE in 2009. She embarked on a retail store business in her area.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is applying for her second loan to increase stock in her store. This loan will be used to buy 20 liters of honey for 30,000 FCFA, 100kg of rice for 30,000 FCFA, a cartoon of soap for 15,000 FCFA, and 125kg of groundnut for 35,000 FCFA. She knows that her trade will be a success because her store is the only one in the quarter and she always meets the demands of the people. Her trade actually helps the community since the demands of the people are satisfied. \r\n\r\nEvelyn had problems in life when the husband died and she was unable to pay her children's school fees. She will use the gain from her loan to buy a plot of land for her children and educate them. She preferred a loan from GHAPE because repayment is in small installments and it offers some training on how loans are to be used.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

women who create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women, as members of a Committee, the energy and motivation to reach success.<p> \r\n\r\nThe Committee \u201c29 de setiembre\u201d (September 29th) is formed of a group of 20 women who live in Limpio. A woman who wanted to become member of another Committee in Villa Elisa city could not make it because she was not living in the same town. As a result she contacted 19 other women living in the same town (Limpio) and convinced them to form another group. That is how \u201c29 de septiembre\u201d  \r\n(September 29th) was born.

The soil in Nekmese Naet Village where Ande lives is fertile, and it has potential to growth coconut and banana. Most of the community in this village relies on the agricultural sector to earn money. The weather and climate in this area is good as the season changes every 6 months. \r\n\r\nAnde is interested in the cattle fattening program because he wants to improve his living standard as a farmer, and the availability of cattle food that he has encourages him to join the cattle fattening program.

V., age 43, lives in Bosa-Brasil.  This neighborhood is just to the south of the capital of Colombia.  Myriam says that her community is united, and the people work together.  There is a great sense of belonging in her community.  \r\n\r\nThat is where she has been able to generate income by working in her own business of making different sizes of felt and foam rollers.\r\n\r\nHer family consists of her three children; ages 24, 12, and 6; and her life partner.  He also works in this activity; he started the business.  Myriam owes it to the experience her husband got when he retired from a company where he learned to make the rollers they now sell.  That is how they decided to live surrounded by handles, covers, screws, felt, and foam. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo she got greater work opportunities.  She was able to add more products or elements to her business.  Now, with this second loan for 1,000,000 COP, she will make repairs to a damaged machine that injects plastic.  Because the machine is damaged their production has been affected.\r\n\r\nWith this money she will also buy materials like handles, covers, screws, felt, and foam.  That way she will continue working in her own house with her husband.  Her biggest challenge is to become a consolidated business at a commercial and labor level in the market.  Part of this challenge is to add other modern machines to improve her work effort.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns good profits from the income generated by these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1997, Josefina joined ASHI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Josefina has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASHI and she received a 100% credit rating. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. \r\n<p>\r\nJosefina is requesting a new loan of 44,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and additional piglets so she can earn more revenue. This will be the tenth loan taken out by Josefina from ASHI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. This will allow Josefina to grow her hog raising business further so that her four children can fulfill their dreams of managing their own business someday. Josefina wants to give her family a decent life.\r\n<p>\r\nJosefina's long term goal is to continue to build her secondary fishing business. She wants to purchase additional raw materials for her fishing business so she can expand it. This will allow her to sell more fish in the local community and in the surrounding neighborhoods. She also hopes to have successful pig farm

She has two employees that work with her and her workshop is in her home.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy fabric and other dressmaking supplies.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that she always has work and good health.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":594630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":" To buy fabric, thread, zippers, buttons, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-09-05T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113595},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407343},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407344},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388461},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388462},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388463},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682872}],"funded_date":"2010-09-05T06:44:37Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":232618,"name":"Hanh's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanh T.

The eldest, 16, is a college student and the two youngest, 9 and 11, are elementary grade pupils. The family\u2019s main source of income is the salary of her husband, but the cost of living in the city is so expensive that she decided to help her husband with their financial needs. She looked for people to help her financially and she found Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a partner of Kiva in the Philippines. She was encouraged to join because of the principles and program that the institution offers. She consulted her husband about her plan, he approved, and she became a member in 2004. She used her previous loans to start a small store business. Her husband is grateful because his wife now helps to support the family. Sheridan is happy as well because, as years passed, her customers have increased and she is earning more. Now she is applying for another loan of PHP 23000 to buy more grocery products. She wants to buy more sacks of rice for retail, soft drinks, liquors, canned goods, assorted snack foods and noodles, kitchen ingredients and personal beauty products. She will be delighted if Kiva lenders will assist her financially. She is hoping that the partnership of ASHI and Kiva will continue and prosper."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":612832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is from El Consuelo, in Pueblo Nuevo, Estel\u00ed.  Marlon has two children aged 8 and 3.  Ten years ago, he travelled to Costa Rica to work and save some money.  As a result, he was able to buy three 'manzanas' of farmland (one 'manzana' = 1.68 acres), and a plot of land where he built his house.  He grows his coffee with the help of his wife who has supported him from the beginning.  When work is slower during the sowing season, he works as a day laborer on neighboring farms. \r\n\r\nMarlon requested this loan to buy manure, supplies, insecticides and fertilizers for his coffee crops, and to pay laborers.

The majority of our population eats tortillas with all three meals.  We sell our product to our neighbors and to nearby eating establishments in our neighborhood.  Around here there are many places to eat because our national soccer stadium is located very close to us.\r\nWith our jobs we have helped our families get ahead.

He works as a nursing assistant and has two children: the oldest is 8 years old and is in second grade, and the youngest is 4. His wife also works as a nursing assistant and together they share household expenses. It's important to mention that since Lucas was very young he has supported his mother. He started working at a young age since his family has limited economic resources, and carried out his work with a lot of responsibility. He feels happy with his job because he helps many people in the Jacinto Baca region. He's studying for a nursing degree, and it's worth emphasizing that this young man is characterized by his modesty and humility, but he posses a strong desire for personal improvement. He aspires to become an excellent professional so he can continue helping his family and the entire community. His goal is to little by little improve his quality of life and that his family lacks nothing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

She sells second hand clothing at the fair all day on Fridays.  Her sales vary depending on the merchandise she has to offer on a given day.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been doing this for eight years and began because her daughter had gotten sick with pancreatic cystic fibrosis.  Starting from scratch was difficult and involved many sacrifices because she also had to pay for her daughter\u2019s medicines.  She started out selling raffle tickets, but it didn\u2019t bring in enough money, so she began selling second-hand clothing out of her home and began saving up to buy packs of clothing.  Now she buys her merchandise, packs of clothing, in Santiago.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy 15 packs, specifically pants, undergarments, children\u2019s and house clothes. \r\nHer goals are to have a local establishment to be able to offer and sell her merchandise (clothing), and to also have a vehicle that will allow her to transport the clothing to different parts of the city, and be able to sell to those who do not have their own transportation.\r\nMar\u00eda lives with her husband and three children, ages 20, 17, and 15, and also cares for one of her nephews who is eight years old.  Her children help her to transport the clothing to the fair, set up the stall and iron the clothes from the packs.\r\n\r\nHer motivations to continue and to succeed in her business are the help she gets from her family, especially her children.\r\nMar\u00eda is very happy and grateful to Fondo Ezperanza and affirms that without their support she would not have been able to continue with her business.  She also actively participates in the communal bank meetings, has been able to make ties off friendship with the group, and has been able to put her new knowledge to work in her business.\r\n\r\nCoronel is a community located in southern Chile, near Concepci\u00f3n, in the B\u00edob\u00edo region.

He and his father operate a farm where they only grow rice. They are in need of capital to purchase the necessary materials to sustain the crop, like fertilizer and pesticides. Holger is not married, nor does he have any children. His short term goal is to make the lands of his family as productive as possible while accumulating some savings. He hopes he can study agronomy in the near future if he has sufficient money and luck. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Holger is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

Sherali is 56 years old. He is married and has four children. Sherali's goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. His dream is that God continues to provide him with more life to get ahead and to fulfill his goals. \r\n\r\nHe is a taxi driver and travels through the streets of Tursunzade, Tajikistan in search of customers. He has owned his business for 30 years. Currently Sherali\u2019s car needs some repairs and he wants to borrow 3000 Somoni for 10 months. The financing will go towards repairs of his vehicle purchasing winter tires. Sherali thanks Kiva and all lenders who make this help possible.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has been involved in buying and selling of men's trousers, suits and shirts.  When he first obtain a loan in the sum of $600 from Imon International, he made a good profit, and then he gradually began increasing his loan amounts.  Last year, when the market burned down, Imon International did not demand interest, but instead supported him by extending his repayment term, so that he could repay his loan without any difficulties.  Now, Mukhamed wants to obtain another loan, which would help him to buy a lot of goods at low prices, then sell them at retail prices and make a good profit.  He is grateful to Imon International and Kiva for the support and mercy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":857800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is a farmer, and has been farming for ten years. She is currently growing sunflowers, beans, maize, and sweet potatoes. She is looking forward to beekeeping as it will give her an opportunity to earn extra income.\r\n\r\nThis is Jackline\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. She intends to use the proceeds from her beekeeping to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and to provide for their basic needs. Jackline\u2019s hope for the future is to produce more honey for more income generation.\r\n\r\nJackline lives in Sindo, a small town in Homa Bay County. Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, close both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts, and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.

He played throughout childhood, studied music at Burgas University for four years and was subsequently in the Bulgarian military band for two years (1972-1974) during the cold war. After completing his military service he was a part of the Bulgarian National Orchestra, a small group that was allowed to travel around the Eastern Block highlighting Bulgarian culture.  During this period, Mitko had to work hard to get copies of the music of his favorite Western musician, Louis Armstrong, as no Western music or books were allowed in Bulgaria. <p>\r\n\r\nAfter the state orchestra was dismantled, Mitko returned to his Roma neighborhood in Sliven.  (The Roma, often referred to as gypsies in the West, are a severely marginalized group on the Balkan Peninsula of Southeastern Europe.)  Now in his early 60s, he works Roma weddings and banquets from fall to the spring and Black Sea beach resorts in the summer. <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan will enable Dimitar to purchase a new saxophone; the one he uses in this video is held together in parts by hair bands and paper clips.  His repayment schedule has smaller payments in the winter while business is slow, and larger payments next summer to pay down debt more quickly as his income increases.  Mitko has 2 kids \u2013 29 and 27 \u2013 and 2 grandchildren as seen in the video. <p>\r\n\r\nA short video of Mitko can be seen here: <p>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OwdFzrFg9_4"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":6599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical Performance","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"New saxophone","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BG","country":"Bulgaria","town":"Sliven","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42.685833 26.329167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":3,"posted_date":"2006-12-07T21:55:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dimitar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-22T18:54:33Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":58.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2007-02-12T12:50:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7353},{"amount":182,"local_amount":182,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T11:58:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":182,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23294},{"amount":182,"local_amount":182,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T12:00:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":182,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23310},{"amount":182,"local_amount":182,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T12:00:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":182,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23326},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-07-30T12:28:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":37112},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-10-23T10:55:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71093},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T13:14:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87119},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T13:03:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106718},{"amount":154,"local_amount":154,"processed_date":"2008-07-28T07:22:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279254}],"funded_date":"2006-12-08T18:54:33Z","paid_date":"2008-07-28T07:22:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6478,"name":"Ilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ilia A. has been licensed as an agricultural producer for five years but he has been in this kind of business for more than 15 years.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Carabalan Road, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental, is a 64-year-old widow and mother of 12 children, seven of whom already have their own families, while five  of the younger children still live at home. As a widow for sometime now, she is used to feeding such a large family and has gained her community's respect because of the way she has raised her children to have integrity and moral fiber. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen Melita was widowed, she had to rely on the income from her general store. To augment her only source of income, Melita decided to make use of her cooking skills and expanded her business to include food vending, and this additional venture enabled her to support her children. But as her capital became insufficient to generate the income to cover the family's needs, Melita decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon after she heard from some of her friends about how it could help her. After getting her children's agreement, she joined NWTF-PD in 1990.<p>\r\n\r\nThe loans from NWTF-PD enabled her to expand the operations of her general store and food vending business. Using her dressmaking skills, she also started making ready-to-wear dresses to sell to her neighbors, and the cumulative income allowed her to support the education of her children. Three of her children have helped out in the family expenses since they graduated from school and began earning their own income. Her business now nets her an average profit of PHP 2,000 per month. <p>\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan she borrowed Php 11,000 which she used as additional capital for the general store and food-vending business. The loan was fully repaid on time.  She plans to use her 16th cycle loan amounting to PHP 11,000 to purchase additional items for her RTW business and the general store. The income from these will be used for her food-vending business.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a mere $1 a day, to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":397963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives with her two children in her own house.  She has been farming for three years.  She has a small farm, which she gets to by a two day trip by boat on the river.  This is where she plants three hectares of beans, five of papaya, and one of bananas.  Silveria is very happy because the papayas produce every day while the beans and bananas are seasonal.  She gets good income from her fruits.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is staying active, and it is profitable for her.  Every time she goes to the farm she takes the opportunity to take second hand clothing with her.  She buys it in the city and sells it to her farming neighbors.  Sometimes she exchanges it for chickens or salted fish, which she sells when she returns home.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  What she likes about her communal bank is that all of the people are accomplished and hard-working.  With the money she is now asking for she will hire people to expand and prepare her farm (five blocks) where she plants corn and yucca.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":410137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Expansion and preparation of her fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-20T15:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silveria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":226.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":234.02},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":243.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":255.93},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":264.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":275.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.34},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.29},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.52},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.34,"local_amount":226.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":228.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843065},{"amount":161.25,"local_amount":460.7,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-17T10:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":463.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734642},{"amount":5.95,"local_amount":17.02,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":17.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124048},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":255.93,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":257.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959725},{"amount":92.52,"local_amount":264.36,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":266.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992572},{"amount":96.36,"local_amount":275.31,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":277.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717358}],"funded_date":"2009-10-20T18:01:33Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":149992,"name":"Erina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Leonora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Leonora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the 16th loan she has taken out  from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Rosita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from GDMPC. Rosita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to buy more charcoal. This will be Rosita's third loan from GDMPC.

Now, he has his own land part of which was inherited from them.  He has about 5 hectares on average but due to lack of capital only farms coffee and bananas with much care and patience only on 3 \"cuadras\" (240 sq. m. approx) of land.  He takes his harvested crops to the central market in La Merced or to his local cooperative to sell.\r\n\r\nHe is currently in the height of the harvest season and is sure to have good profits.  In addition, he earns extra money selling seedlings; he sells them at 400 soles per one thousand.\r\n\r\nWhat he most enjoys about his work is harvesting his crops because he feels that his hard work is having good results.  He\u2019s been in this line of work for 10 years and considers protecting his crops from infestations that can affect them to be the most difficult part of it.  In his spare time he polishes wood to make boards thus earning extra money.

Her partner works at various jobs and does not have a fixed monthly income. This is why she decided to help with the household expenses. This is how she started this small project which initially began as a small hobby. Now, it is a way of life for her. She works alone but on occasion her older children help her. What she likes about her work is that it gives her independence and allows her to manage her own time. She is doing well and hopes to continue doing so. She plans on growing her business and setting up a few more chicken sheds. This will be her 3rd loan with MFP. She is very happy knowing that she will have financial support as in this way she will feel secure moving forwards with her business. On the other hand, she agrees once again to make her repayments, as she did with the previous loan she had. She also likes being a part of her communal bank as all the members are very responsible and very supportive people.

She is married to Jos\u00e9 and they live alone in a home on their property since their children have their own homes where they live with their respective families where they visit them often.\r\n\r\nThe activity that Mar\u00eda performs is selling soda. For this she has a refrigerator that she bought with the help of her husband where she keeps her products very cold as her customers like them. This activity is easier for her because of the health problem that pains her legs and doesn't allow her to move about easily. For this reason she began her business five years ago, doing it alone but without a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her business is having the financial income that allows her to support her husband with some household expenses, as well as with expenses for the therapy for her legs since she was diagnosed with osteoporosis and they recommended that she not walk much. On the contrary, what she doesn't like about her work is that it depends on the hot climate, and when it rains and is cold, her sales decrease. On the other hand, she has a great desire to continue advancing and wishes to be able to get healthy in order to take up her business of selling food or opening a grocery store in her home again.\r\n\r\nThis will be the sixth loan with the MFP institution. She is thankful for the opportunity to have a loan to advance her business. For this reason she will fulfill the payments of her installments like with previous loans.

K. is 36-years old, married and has one child. Linus has no secondary school certificate, but when he came to Nairobi, he decided not to be idle. He first worked as a casual laborer for several construction firms. While working he managed to save Ksh 2,000.00 ($29), which he used to buy a shaving machine and some combs. Unfortunately he was dismissed from his casual duties after the construction firm closed its doors. He was then employed as a guard at Ayany estate, the up-market part of Kibera, where he saved Ksh 3,000.00 ($42). With this, he was able to rent a small room where he operates a barbershop. At night he works as a guard, and during the day he operates his barbershop. From the barbershop profits, he started a water-selling point (place to buy water). In 2005, Linus added two more water selling points. The Government of Kenya's vision is that by the year 2030, every Kenyan will have access to clean water. Linus' water-selling projects help provide clean and safe water to the residents of Kibera, which decreases water borne diseases by a big margin.\r\n\r\nBeing a very hard working and determined person with a vision of business expansion, Linus wants to start selling clean water ice cubes. These are rectangular-shaped ice blocks used mostly by shopkeepers and fishmongers as a cooling agent since they do not own refrigerators.

Her business is making clothes, especially for women. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week. Hidaya currently earns about $80 USD a month from her business.

Hidaya thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":290683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials to make women's clothes for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T17:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hidaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613675},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010754},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233040},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664831},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105543},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022669},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867918},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757119},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146231},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":42412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984393}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T18:13:14Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":100726,"name":"Rasim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This young man was born in 1983.

He lives with his wife and children in their own home in the Ventanilla district. He began working when he was very young and has had a variety of jobs. At one of his jobs, he learned to drive, and since then he has had the goal of having his own car. After many years of hard work he was finally able to buy a truck, which he now uses to transport cargo. The work is difficult, as he usually has to leave very early in the morning and finishes late at night. Happily, he doesn't work alone, as his wife is by his side. She is the driving force behind their home, and supports him unconditionally. Roberto knows that together they can achieve all their dreams, as they are very motivated and always do their best in everything they do.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Roberto's first loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA, and he promises to be punctual with its repayment. He knows that this is a great responsibility, and he is grateful to all those who are making this loan possible and helping him get closer to his goals. He will use this loan to refurbish his truck and to put a down payment on another one, which will increase his income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":310376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Refurbish his truck","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87.74},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.9},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94.24},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.65},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":101.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":105.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":109.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":112.6},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.63},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.71},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.16},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.98},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.41},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.63,"local_amount":84.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":90.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596170},{"amount":30.71,"local_amount":87.74,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":94.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990445},{"amount":32.16,"local_amount":91.9,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":98.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211560},{"amount":32.98,"local_amount":94.24,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":101.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641064},{"amount":34.18,"local_amount":97.65,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080522},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":101.18,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":108.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996667},{"amount":36.88,"local_amount":105.37,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":113.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842153},{"amount":118.05,"local_amount":337.25,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":361.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733812}],"funded_date":"2009-05-02T19:32:40Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"k vickery","image":389145}},{"id":108918,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilou is married and has one school-age child.

She is raising them by herself as her husband passed away. She sells clothes in Kisumu, just off the main street. She hopes to expand her business and make enough profit to purchase a cow. The cow will serve as both an extra source of food as well as a buffer against food insecurity should she face it in the future. \r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear the interviewer greet Millicent saying \u201cIdhi Nade\u201d, which is Luo for \u201cHow are you?\u201d Millicent responds, \u201cAdhi maber,\u201d meaning \u201cvery good.\u201d Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama\u2019s father. At the end, you will hear the interviewer fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \u201cAsante Sana\u201d in Kiswahili, meaning \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cErokamano\u201d, which in Luo means \u201cthank you.\u201d The voices in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI.

She is thankful that she has her vending stall in front of her house so that she does not have to roam from one house to another to sell her produce.

She is 57, widowed, and has 4 children who are 35, 30, 27 and 23 years old.  None of them are going to school.  Felisima only finished third grade and did not continue because her parents could not afford it and focused more on work that produced food.  She lives in her own house with her children and supports two relatives (nieces or nephews) who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Moamba for Maputo because of the civil war that also ravaged that District.  For more than 20 years, she has had her own business.  She has one employee who helps her with her business, and she earns about 20,000 meticais per month.  She uses this for household expenses and even saves some in her bank accounts (at Millenium Bim and Standard Bank).\r\n\r\nFelisima has had loans before with Malengane Credit Union, but she decided not to continue with them.  She learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This 25,000 meticais loan is her first; she will use it to buy products (meat, spices, rice, soft drinks, beer, and other products) to increase and diversify her merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out other loans.  One of her biggest projects is to open her new shop and offer better service to her customers.  She intends to ask for more loans to use for the growth of her business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva
