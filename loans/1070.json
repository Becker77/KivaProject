His loan will offer him another source of income to help him provide for his family. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Watta from Kulanda Town in Bo, Sierra Leone. She is 36 years old with three children and they all go to school. Watta runs a clothing store selling blouses, skirts and shirts. She works at her business 15 hours a day, 6 days a week.  \r\n\r\nWatta requested the loan to purchase more clothing for her store to sell during the dry season.

Mamie runs a local food business; she sells palm oil, chicken, garden eggs and gari (processed cassava flour). She has been running this business for 15 years. She works at the business every day, 6 days per week, and she has her children help her run the business. Her business is her only source of income. Mamie says that the main challenges to her business are slow purchasing power of her customers and occasional vehicle breakdowns on her way to the business. Mamie has applied for a loan in order to buy more palm oil, chickens, garden eggs and gari for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and help pay her grandchildren\u2019s fees. In the future, next year, she plans to have a bigger shop.

Paula makes her home here in a simple structure, with her long-term partner and their five children.\r\n\r\nPaula is excited to be taking her 16th loan with Esperanza International Dominican Republic after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. This businesswoman runs different sales in her business, one is selling used sewing machines (for domestic use) and the other is selling coconut oil. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing sewing machines to sell and coconuts from which to extract oil.\r\n\r\nPaula said that her most difficult challenge has been to raise her children and educate them while she has been working to support her long-term partner. She will use the profits to reinvest and to save for any needs in her family. She thanks you all for your support.

She is asking for a loan of 10,000 GTQ to buy a larger assortment of groceries, thus increasing her store in order to offer better service and get a better income for her family.

Teresa is a very hard working woman, above all because she is a single mother and is getting her three children, aged 4, 10 and 14, ahead. For Teresa, her children are the best gift that God has been able to give her and are her reason for continuing to fight everyday despite the adversity that she faces. Teresa was only able to study up to the fifth grade of secondary school because her parents had minimum economic resources. She would have liked to have studied medicine. \r\n\r\nDay to day, Teresa works as an employee in the mornings and in the afternoons she sells her goods including tamales, parboiled eggs, corn and cheese, and other items. She passes through the streets of her neighborhood on a tricycle, so that she can have an extra source of income to move her family forward. She belives that she is getting ahead because she is responsible and has a strong desire to improve. \r\n\r\nTeresa is very thankful for the support that Kiva lenders are bringing to her because thanks to this help she will be able to buy construction materials including cement, sand, bricks and other items. With these materials she will be able to build a business space and improve her customer service, allowing her to continue fighting to make her most sought after dream come true--to give her children the chance to become professionals.

Martha has five children, ages 24, 29, 30, 31, and 34, all of whom are working. She began her business looking for a means of subsistence because her children were in school. She was both mother and father at the same time for them. First she began with the sale of soft drinks and enchiladas on buses, but later she began to prepare meals, and in this way she began to acquire customers. Now her business is her main source of employment. Each has had her business for more than 10 years. They are applying for the loan to buy rice, beans, oil, disposable plates, soft drinks, sugar, coffee, and other items.

Samana. This is his seventh loan, which he will use to improve his house. He has had his business for over six years, started from his savings.\r\n\r\nAfter his last loan, which he invested in his business, Jose realised the need to build his home's roof.  With this housing loan he is able to take, and with his business profits, he can pay for it and save for more home improvements. The other members of his group are recommending him for a housing loan to start with the house construction. Now he will build this house roof and make other change like floors, etc.\r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a programme for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings. \r\n\r\nJose lives together with his long term partner, who is also the mother of his 3 children. He is also a micro-entrepreneur conducting fish sales. He thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity. In his name and that of his family, he thanks all of you for your

Now she wants to set up her own business. She needs a source of income because the earnings of her father, who grows crops for a living, are very small. The family recently hosted a celebration and their savings were depleted. They are currently facing very difficult living conditions, which is why Mohira really needs support. She is seeking a loan of 850 US dollars to buy cattle so she can start her own business.

Sojida is one such person who is trying to improve her standard of living and jumpstart the economic situation of her family. She is married and has 4 children at home. Her husband works in farming but his income is not sufficient to provide his family with all their necessities. Sojida has decided to help her husband for the welfare of the family. For this reason, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" organised by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she received a certificate.

She lives with her husband, Ever, and young son, Pa\u00fal, whom she looks after in a rural house that she inherited five years ago.  Mary Luz has lived in the country since she was born and she learned to look after and work the land, alongside her parents who were also peasant farmers.  Her parents taught her agricultural techniques and how to raise cattle.  \"At first I only planted various foods, I had a lot of problems which led me to be more cautious.  Now I only sow a small amount,\" she says.  These agricultural failings helped her now to work with cattle, particularly raising cows.  She has nine of them, which provide the milk she needs to make cheese, her main work.  She says that she makes 40 units of cheese per day to sell in the cities of Lima and Huancayo.  This helps her to improve her income.  Her wish for the future is to increase the number of cows she has so as to produce 300 litres of milk a day and so be able to sell her milk to one of the country's largest processing businesses.  She hopes to do this as she has a substantial area of grazing land.  This is Mary Luz's first loan with MFP and she is grateful for the support provided.  In addition she promises to make her repayments on time.  Mary Luz is applying for 2000 Nuevo Soles, which will be invested in buying a new cow, to increase her cattle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1298836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T09:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T09:50:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":218.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":232.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":236.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":243.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":252.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":263.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":270.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":280.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.71,"local_amount":218.61,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-19T08:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":218.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123110},{"amount":90.27,"local_amount":232.96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868958},{"amount":91.81,"local_amount":236.93,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":237.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577799},{"amount":94.45,"local_amount":243.73,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":244.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530030},{"amount":97.89,"local_amount":252.63,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":253.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975060},{"amount":102.22,"local_amount":263.79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":264.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996329},{"amount":104.94,"local_amount":270.81,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":271.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863846},{"amount":108.71,"local_amount":280.54,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":280.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352294}],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T13:41:45Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":530154,"name":"Aracely Ang\u00e9lica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Aracely vive en la cuidad de Managua actualmente trabaja como secretaria de una instituci\u00f3n madre de dos hijos en edad escolar.\n\nAracely esta solicitando a kiva y ceprodel un cr\u00e9dito para invertirlos  una parte del cr\u00e9dito en compra de \u00fatiles escolares,  pago de matricula para sus hijos ya que estamos iniciando el a\u00f1o escolar y son gastos necesarios para que sus hijos puedan ir a la escuela.\n\nDo\u00f1a Aracely se siente agradecida por que con el primer cr\u00e9dito que  se le otorgo a trav\u00e9s de ceprodel kiva lo utilizo en la compra de materiales de construcci\u00f3n para su casa. ahora podra enviar a sus hijos a la escuela que es su prioridad.\n","en":"This member, Mrs. Aracely, lives in the city of Managua and currently works as a secretary in an institution.

capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (portable felt dwelling) on plot of land. His wife has a position as a book-keeper at a business entity. His elder daughter works as a distributor at an organization which administers the water supply; she is now on maternity leave. His younger daughter works as a bar-keeper in a private business entity. He himself is retired from work and gets a state pension. In retirement, he began transporting his daughter's children to their school and kindergarten. \r\n\r\nIn the near future, he wants to build his own house on his land. So he is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase fiber glass, cement and bricks. During this period of the year, the price of building materials reaches its lowest rate and it will save him quite a lot of money. Using his savings, he has already purchased foam substances and other materials. As spring approaches, he will begin construction work on his house. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future for the sake of his children. Building a high-quality house has several advantages, namely it will reduce the usage of coal thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution and will provide better living conditions for the

His business is brick production, and he makes them from soil, firewood, and sawdust, etc.  During the interview Nelson indicated that he has known the trade of making bricks ever since he was little.

Locals take good care of nature because close to their village, lies the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, visited by tourists from all over the world.\r\n\r\nJosefina is a member of the \"Luz del d\u00eda\" [Daylight] group. She says that thanks to the loans, her business has grown a lot. She started with a small table, selling sweets more than fifteen years ago. Step by step, she started buying nonperishable food and after a while, fruits and vegetables. She now has a larger store at home, which is located by the road leading to the reserve and the archaeological area of Zirahuato, which is also very popular.\r\n\r\nJosefina says that she has been working with VisionFund for several cycles and that their loans have helped her a lot. She says: \"since I started working with the institution, my store is better stocked and my neighbors choose it over other stores, since I have everything they need.

solicitando cr\u00e9dito a la instituci\u00f3n esta vez solo quedaron seis integrantes tres de ellas son nuevas y tres de ellas ya estaban trabajando con la instituci\u00f3n. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque ellas se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n de bordados. Do\u00f1a Zenaida se integra al grupo ella tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada desde hace 21 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Rom\u00e1n juntos han formado una familia con dos hijos de los cuales se encuentran estudiando Don Rom\u00e1n trabaja en la construcci\u00f3n mientras que Do\u00f1a Zenaida desde hace 21 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar elaborando sus bordados para posteriormente venderlos, esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando cr\u00e9dito a la instituci\u00f3n para comprar material como, tela, hilos de distintos colores, agujas especiales para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus artesan\u00edas como colchas, gabanes, chalecos, su\u00e9teres, etc. Do\u00f1a Zenaida platica que dese muy peque\u00f1a ella ve\u00eda como su mam\u00e1 se dedicaba a la elaboraci\u00f3n de estas artesan\u00edas le llamaba mucho la atenci\u00f3n poco a poco viendo aprendi\u00f3 solo que algunos puntos como el de trencilla se le dificultaba elaborarlos pero afortunadamente pudo aprender con el tiempo, la se\u00f1ora Zenaida argumento: \u201cMe gusta mucho realizar mi trabajo por una parte porque es una manera de ayudar a mi esposo con los gastos del hogar, con la educaci\u00f3n de mis hijos pero por otra parte es para conservar nuestras artesan\u00edas ya que con el tiempo se han ido perdiendo muchas personas ya no valoran nuestro trabajo como nosotras quisi\u00e9ramos\u201d. Comenta esto porque no les pagan lo que realmente es el precio de la prenda. Do\u00f1a Zenaida va a vender sus artesan\u00edas a una tienda de ropa en la capital ah\u00ed deja sus artesan\u00edas para que las escojan y regresa para ver si ya se vendieron solo que muchas veces no les regresan sus prendas ni su dinero y simplemente les dicen \u201cla prenda se perdi\u00f3\u201d al parecer es la \u00fanica manera de sacar a la venta sus artesan\u00edas porque estar ofreciendo de casa en casa o en otras comunidades es muy dif\u00edcil que las compren y si las llegan a comprar es muy dif\u00edcil que les paguen es por eso que llevan sus artesan\u00edas a una tienda de la capital.\nZenaida est\u00e1 muy contenta por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado porque le ser\u00e1 de gran ayuda para comprar el material que le hace falta y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 seguir trabajando con la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus prendas artesanales a Do\u00f1a Zenaida le gustar\u00eda que sus hijos puedan terminar una carrera profesional para que puedan tener un mejor sustento econ\u00f3mico. Las integrantes del grupo son Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles quien invertir\u00e1 su cr\u00e9dito en productos de belleza, Mar\u00eda Juana, Nancy, Zenaida, Mar\u00eda de la Luz, Angelina ellas compraran material para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus artesan\u00edas. Ellas como Zenaida est\u00e1n muy agradecidas con KIVA y VisionFund por todos los cr\u00e9ditos otorgados.\n","en":"The communal bank Artesanas del Fresno has had several loan cycles with the institution. This time there are just six members, three who are new and three who have worked with the institution. The group chose its name based on the members' needlework.  Zenaida, a member, is 42 and has been married to Rom\u00e1n for 21 years. Their two children are students. Rom\u00e1n is a construction worker, and Zenaida decided 21 years ago to help her husband meet household expenses by doing needlework to sell. \r\n\r\nShe is applying to the institution for a loan to buy materials such as fabric, different colors of thread, and special needles to make handicrafts like quilts, coats, vests, and jerseys. Zenaida says that, as a child, she carefully watched her mother make handicrafts and slowly learned the trade. Some techniques such as braiding were difficult, but she was able to learn them over time. Zenaida claims, \u201cI like my work because it lets me help my husband with expenses and our children's education, but it also is a way to preserve our craftsmanship, which many people have lost because they don't appreciate our work as much as we would like.\" She feels this way because the selling price doesn't cover the cost of making the garments.\r\n\r\nZenaida will sell her garments to a clothing store in the capital. She can leave the merchandise there so the vendors can make a selection. She goes back to see if items have been sold because often the vendors don't return her garments or pay her and simply say that the garments were lost. It seems to be the only way to sell artesania, as selling door-to-door in other towns is very hard; if people buy, it's hard to collect payments. So, she takes her merchandise to the store in the capital.\r\n\r\nZenaida is happy to have the loan because it will allow her to buy the material she needs to keep creating handmade garments. Zenaida would love to see her children follow a professional career that would provide more income. The communal bank members are: Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles, who will buy cosmetics, and Mar\u00eda Juana, Nancy, Zenaida, Mar\u00eda de la Luz, and Angelina, who will buy materials to make artesan\u00eda. Like Zenaida, they are grateful to KIVA and VisionFund for the loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1295376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials such as fabric, different colors of thread, and special needles to make handicrafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T17:40:06Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De La Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":190.63,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2411.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199301},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4822.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596094},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4822.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663522},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4822.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048937},{"amount":190.62,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2411.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840104}],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T20:55:45Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":530202,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana, de 33 a\u00f1os esta casada y tiene dos hijos, a quienes desea poder brindarles una buena educaci\u00f3n y una mejor calidad de vida, viven juntos en su casa propia, lugar que logr\u00f3 comprar a base de esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n.El trabajo de Juana consiste en la venta de s\u00e1banas.

She's 61 years old and comes from a community that is rich in pine and \"oyamel\" forests, and where the majority of residents work in sheep breeding and avocado cultivation, for which the weather is favorable. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Clemen, which is how she's known, leads a group called Estrellas, made up of very hard-working women. They have gone through a rough time lately because, as Do\u00f1a Clementina tells, \"my niece, who was part of our group, got sick recently and was diagnosed with leukemia. It's really painful to see her suffer, although she's already having chemotherapy, thank goodness. I feel sad to see her this way because she was a very healthy woman with many life projects and suddenly got sick and had to be taken into a hospital in Morelia. We now ask God for her prompt recovery and are helping her to overcome her illness faster.\"\r\n\r\nClementina makes a living cultivating avocado and breeding sheep and chickens in her house. She says they have a large piece of land and she and her husband put a lot of enthusiasm in it to provide for their only child, who is a teenager and attends his last semester of high-school. She says that they are being able to support him with a lot of effort and that, although she doesn't have money to leave in bequest, she's supporting his studies to help him get ahead in life. He's responding with good grades. \r\n\r\nClemen has a crop with over 80 avocado trees and, during harvest season, she sells them at the supplies' market in buckets so that she makes a bit more money. She's now requesting a loan to buy fertilizer, insecticide and \"calidra\" to paint her trees to avoid plagues and get the fruit in good condition. She says her dream is to have a big crop and a big henhouse, as she likes animals and plants.

As a program manager at a local conservation NGO in the district, he is also involved in promoting cacao production in agroforestry systems. According to Bartholomew, he got involved in cacao because it contributes to environmental health and social well-being of the farmers, and because he wants to be a role model for cacao farmers who are the NGOs' target audience.   \n\nThe cacao farm is doing well for Bartolo because production, only in its second year, is picking up quickly to his great excitement. Aside from cacao, he also plants timber to practice the principles of agroforestry promoted in his work. He also plants plantain and pineapple for home use.\n\nBartolo's favorite part of cacao farming is harvesting because unlike other stages of working with cacao, it\u2019s not particularly hard. Harvesting involves picking the ripe pods on the trees and cracking them to extract the seeds inside. A cacao pod typically houses 35 seeds surrounded by a sweet juicy pulp that can be enjoyed as a fruit, but starts fermenting shortly after it is opened. Farmers have the option of either processing their own cacao or selling it wet for centralized fermentation and drying. The challenging part for Bartolo is field maintenance due to his busy work schedule. Oftentimes Bartolo checks on his farm early in the morning before heading out to work. \n\nBartolo is requesting this loan to hire people from his village to clean his cacao farm so that he can focus fully on his job while also maintaining his agricultural activities. Cleaning is the process of removing the underbrush from the cacao farm as well as cleaning the surroundings to facilitate airflow in the field and make trees accessible for pruning or harvest.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1299674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

road that connects southern Belize to southeastern Guatemala. The kids, ages eight to twelve, are all currently in school, and help out around the farm on free time. Teresa takes care of the family, helps out at the farm and makes local Maya crafts including woven baskets from the jippi jappa palm as well as hand bracelets. \n\nNew to cacao farming, Victor was encouraged to enter in the trade by his father, who is a member in the local cooperative.  \u201cI wanted to see what I can doo with it too,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao. Last year, Victor used savings from five years of gardening and landscaping work in the resort town of Placencia to purchase a cacao farm of three acres and around 850 trees. Seeing the benefit of cacao farming already, he is planning to expand the farm by transplanting 250 seedlings raised in bags in an on-farm nursery. \u201cCacao is money in the bank. When you\u2019re harvesting, you feel happy you\u2019re not wasting time with what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \n\nThe tricky parts of cacao farming for Victor and many of his peers are the woodpeckers and the squirrels. Cacao pods are defenseless against the assailants, who work their way through the thick pod to pick at the seeds one at a time. Farmers can save a \u201cbroken into\u201d pod if they find it within a short period of its opening. However, with frequent rains, if any water reaches the seeds housed inside, they germinate and the crop can be deemed useless. \u201cYou could spend the whole day on the farm, come back another day at daybreak and they\u2019d already gotten to your ripe pods,\u201d says Victor, who is looking into buying a pellet gun, among other investments for his farm.\n\nIf all goes well in the cacao growing business, Victor is hoping to open his home and organic farm for tourists. Besides cacao, he grows corn, beans and ginger, and he plans to start planting coffee. Also, alongside his work on the farm, Victor is the Vice-Alcalde (mayor) for his village and works in the nearby Rio Blanco National Park. This loan will help Victor with his first expansion. Before planting, he will first need to prepare the land by chopping the underbrush and lining. Lining is the process of planning and marking the spots where seedlings will be planted to ensure a linear structure and sufficient spacing. The task at hand will require hiring three men to help Victor on the farm for six days. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1299676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To clean and expand a cacao farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Santa Elena","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":95.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971172},{"amount":78.16,"local_amount":156.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":157.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751697},{"amount":41,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":82.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993438},{"amount":42.29,"local_amount":84.59,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":85.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255607},{"amount":38.54,"local_amount":77.08,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":77.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136447},{"amount":2.5,"local_amount":4.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900664},{"amount":83.41,"local_amount":166.82,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":168.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088545},{"amount":41.59,"local_amount":83.17,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673284},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":84.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144110},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":166.7,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":168.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467959961}],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T20:34:22Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:26:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":529818,"name":"Arceli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arceli offers homemade breads in her locality.

He and his wife Monica have brought up four children, all of who are enrolled in school at the moment. Apart from his jewelry shop, he is also involved in cacao farming. He is managing eight acres of cacao that he planted five years ago and that are now beginning to produce pods. He got into cacao because he was looking for a crop to plant on his land, and was interested in the stable market and good prices for cacao.  \n\nClarence is really excited about cacao because his trees are producing for the first time and he is confident that as the years go by his production will increase. Besides cacao, he also plants various fruit trees on his farm. His wife Monica stays home to take care of the three kids and his oldest son goes out with him on the farm on the weekends.\n \nAccording to Clarence, his favorite part of cacao farming is the harvesting process because all of the hard work is done at that point and it\u2019s just a matter of walking and picking the ripe pods. The challenging part for him is the cleaning because it requires a significant amount of time and his jewelry shop keeps him busy.\n\nClarence is requesting the loan to hire people from Big Falls to clean his farm and also to plant 4,000 more cacao trees as an investment in his family's future. Cleaning is the process of removing the underbrush in the cacao farm to clear access for harvesting and pruning. Cacao grows in agroforestry systems on lush jungle soil that gets plenty of rain in the wet season and sun in the dry season, resulting in fast-paced growth. Farmers typically have to clean their cacao fields three times a year. Planting is the process of transplanting seedlings grown in bags for six months into the ground and requires precision in spacing among other things.

She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nLetecia hopes to make her variety store a grocery store.

She is a single mother who puts in plenty of effort to provide for her two-year-old son, who is her greatest motivation to keep working hard despite the adversities in her life. Her home is located in the lovely city of Aguaytia. Agriculture is a particularly important industry in Aguaytia, especially the cultivation of cocoa, cassava, and bananas, among others. It also has some beautiful tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nWhen she has some free time, Sarita likes to listen to music, especially because her little son dances to the sound of the music and that makes her very happy. She also likes to eat one of her favorite dishes, the delicious \"Tallar\u00edn Saltado\" (fried rice with wonton). Due to her limited financial resources, she was only able to study to the primary school level, but she would have liked very much to have a university degree.\r\n\r\nDay to day, Sarita works with plenty of effort and enthusiasm as a farmer. She has a small plot of land where she has planted coffee. She works for about 10 hours a day in her business, because she has to pay very close attention to the growth of her crops and make sure that no infestation affects the fruits of her plants. She believes that her work is going well because she is very responsible and thorough, and above all because she likes her work.\r\n\r\nSarita is very grateful and happy with the help that the Kiva lenders are giving her, because thanks to their help she will be able to buy manure and fertilizer to avoid infestations in her crops. In this way, she will be able to obtain better crop growth and a better harvest. She will then be able to improve her income and continue working and fighting to make her greatest dream come true: \"To build her house with good-quality materials and to provide her son with a profession.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1299013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy manure and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Aguaytia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T21:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T21:00:09Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450390672}],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T22:49:56Z","paid_date":"2014-02-21T09:41:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":529829,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Alma.

For the past eight years, Perusi has been working hard to manage her food-related business; specifically, she buys and sells maize and rice. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Perusi has requested a loan in the amount of 700,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to obtain additional inventory, such as dry beans and maize flour, to sell.

Perusi hopes that, in the future, she will be able to purchase even more inventory. <p> \r\n\r\nPerusi is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She describes her biggest business challenge as insufficient funds for improving the business. \r\n\r\nZipporah will use this 90,000 Kenyan shilling (KES) loan to buy household items to sell. Her business goal is to be a distributor within five years. She hopes that, in the future, she will run the leading profitable distributor business in her hometown. This is her third loan with SMEP DTM after managing to repay her previous loans of 20,000 KES and 50,000 KES."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1298494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy household items to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Maua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":138,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T03:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T03:20:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zipporah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355920907},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364634432},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373027743},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381817110},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390675836},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399921471},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410204449},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419968936},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429621547}],"funded_date":"2013-03-01T06:08:16Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T22:21:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":529928,"name":"Desebel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Desebel is 26 years old and married with two children.

","en":"This is Hanifa, a loving mother who, in spite of her age, is still working hard and doing everything she can for her children.  Her husband unfortunately died a few years ago, leaving her alone with four children.  Since that day, she has had to assume a huge responsibility as the head of her family and the protector of her children.  Besides raising her children, she has had to provide them with food and keep them away from poverty.  \r\n\r\nHanifa worked very hard and was able to find sources of income which allowed her to stand on her feet.  In order to reach her goals, she turned to the organization MDO Arvand and applied for loans more than once.  She repaid these loans on time, which clearly shows that she is a responsible woman and a caring mother.  Thanks to the loans she took, she was able to create adequate living conditions for her children.  \r\n\r\nHaving worked and saved money for some time, she decided to open a small business.  Last year she rented a store and started to sell small everyday items.  She gradually expanded her business, and also started to sell household goods.  The demand for her goods began to increase, and she received orders from her customers to purchase other necessary items.  Today, Hanifa's store contains everything, from matches to kitchen utensils and blankets.\r\n\r\nIn order to further expand her business and to buy more merchandise, Hanifa is requesting a new loan.  This time again, she truly hopes to receive help and assistance from MDO Arvand, in order to further develop her small business.  She thanks MDO Arvand in advance for their support and their trust.  She strongly believes that a brighter future awaits her children and that they will be worthy of their father's name and of the support their mother has given them in her late years."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1292396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase household goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hanifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":108.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":111.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":113.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":116.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":118.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":121.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":123.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":126.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":129.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":131.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.72,"local_amount":108.72,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":108.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863716},{"amount":111.1,"local_amount":111.1,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":111.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572660},{"amount":113.53,"local_amount":113.53,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":113.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971430},{"amount":116.02,"local_amount":116.02,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":116.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751940},{"amount":118.56,"local_amount":118.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":118.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616013},{"amount":121.16,"local_amount":121.16,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":121.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859883},{"amount":123.81,"local_amount":123.81,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":123.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136631},{"amount":387.1,"local_amount":387.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":387.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900826}],"funded_date":"2013-02-23T04:52:11Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":529939,"name":"Theresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theresa is a small trader in Soba, Hohoe community.

This traditional dish is often served either with meat or fish such as fried or roasted fish, roasted chicken, and roasted turkey. \r\n\r\nChristine's husband is a farmer in their community.  Christine uses her income to assist her husband with the general upkeep of their family.  She will use the loan to purchase a large bag of maize, and use part for the preparation of her kenkey dish and another part will expand her food production into making corn porridge for breakfast, another local favorite in her community. Through this expansion of her food selling business Christine hopes to generate additional income to further expand her food businesses. In addition, with the new profits from her expanded business, Christine plans to save for her old age."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1298522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy maize to make food for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Hohoe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T05:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T05:20:11Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":202.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347202660},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":404.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364730607},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":202.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381678568}],"funded_date":"2013-02-22T07:38:57Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:47:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":529952,"name":"Sheryl","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sheryl is a 37-year-old married woman with two children who are both in school.

","en":"Fotima is a kind and responsible woman who has turned to Arvand for a loan.  She is 42 years old and is married with three children.  Neither Fotima nor her husband have a higher education, which is why they and their whole family raise livestock.  They have ten head of cattle that comprise their only income, which is acceptable.  Fotima learned about this line of work from her parents.  Every week her husband takes the fattened cows to the market to sell and he immediately purchases young calves.  Fotima is trying to increase their business.  For a long time, she has dreamed of making repairs to their home, as they live in very poor conditions.  She hopes to save up the money and maybe this summer she can improve their living situation for her children.  On receiving her loan, Fotima plans to buy a few head of livestock, as they are available at a lower price right now.  She thanks Arvand in advance for their financial support and understanding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1284982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fotima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":488.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":499.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":512.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":488.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":499.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":488.15,"local_amount":488.15,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":488.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550015},{"amount":1011.85,"local_amount":1011.85,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774245}],"funded_date":"2013-02-23T12:40:36Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":529977,"name":"Ziriya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ziriya is married with four children and all her children go to school.

She has been in active farming for 20 successive years, with farming being the main source of income to meet family needs. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea and crops. She gets milk both from dairy cows and dairy goats.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Milking!' Her biggest challenge is 'Feeding the cows.' She has named one of her goats 'Brown.'\r\n\r\nNjeri was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'because their terms and conditions are fair.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: 'a client must be in an organised group.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Njeri replied 'Increase in income will improve the living standard of her family.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Njeri owns the following: 'cow and poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs

Stella is 19 years old and lives in the town of Iganga in the Iganga region of Uganda. For the past 4 years, Stella has been working hard to manage her bar, which offers up beers for sale. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Stella has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to improve on the business and buy more drinks such as soda, beer, wine and spirits to sell, and will help Stella to generate greater profits and be in position to provide for herself. Stella hopes that in the future she will be able to buy household requirements. \r\n\r\nStella is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She has three children and has been working as a farmer for 10 years.  Her primary sources of income are tea, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nNancy says the most enjoyable part of farming is 'watering my plants!'. Her biggest challenge is 'getting water from the river to irrigate'. Her animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Jesse.'\r\n\r\nNancy was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, and she replied: 'Their terms and conditions are fair.'  She was also asked what she had learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, and she said that: 'Loan must be paid on the agreed day.'\r\n\r\nNancy's highest monthly expense is school fees for her children. When she is asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Nancy says 'I will be able to educate my children because I will have more income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Juhudi Kilimo also uses this evaluation to measure any change in living standards resulting from the loan. Nancy owns a cow, but does not own 'pig, poultry, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. She has in her household 'mosquito net, TV, DVD' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1298649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

His biggest challenge is diseases and lack of animal pasture during dry seasons. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Maua and Upendo.\r\n\r\nMoses was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied that he learnt that they give loans to farmers at a lower interest rate as compared to other Micro Financial Institutions. This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. He answered that they are loans given to small scale farmers and businesses.\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked how this loan benefit your family, Moses replied that the income generated from the sale of milk will help me to pay school fees for my children.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Moses owns the following a cow, poultry, bicycle, and motorcycle but does not own a pig, pump, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household, a mosquito net, and TV but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo

","en":"Akram was born in 1969 in a rural area. He is married and has 4 children. He does not have post-secondary education because he was unable to study in his younger years. He earns his livelihood by repairing shoes, and he is proud of his work. He began as an apprentice in this field when he was 25 years old. For 5 years he worked with a master cobbler (mentor), then he rented his own business premises. Now his services are in big demand and he has several apprentices. However, his workshop is in bad condition and he has decided to renovate it. For this reason, Akram has approached Arvand for a loan that will allow him to buy building materials so he can fix his place of business and create a better atmosphere for himself and his clients. He is very grateful to Arvand. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1292433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":" to purchase building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akram","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":148.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":155.58},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":162.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":169.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":177.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":185.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.5,"local_amount":148.88,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":159.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863719},{"amount":35,"local_amount":155.58,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":166.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572663},{"amount":36.58,"local_amount":162.58,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":173.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971433},{"amount":38.23,"local_amount":169.9,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":181.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751943},{"amount":81.69,"local_amount":363.06,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":388.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616016}],"funded_date":"2013-02-22T17:21:55Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":530024,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"\nCasada e m\u00e3e de 2 filhos que frequentam a Escola, vive na casa pr\u00f3pria e sustenta seus pais enviando dinheiro para auxiliar nas despesas alimentares.\n\u00c9 docente e quadro do Minist\u00e9rio de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o.

","en":"Rahmon lives in the rural area, in a village far away from town. Rahmon works in construction and house renovation; he also has some experience raising livestock. He launched his livestock business by buying a single cow and developing this business further. The cow produced milk, which Rahmon sold to buy feed. At first things were hard for him, especially during wintertime, when the ground would be covered with snow and he would have to spend more on feed. But, as time went by, he gained experience, and started finding solutions and means to manage his business better. At present he has over 30 heads of cattle. His wife and five children also help out in this business. Rahmon needs additional means to buy more cattle. This is why he applied to MDO Arvand for a loan. He plans to use this loan to buy cattle for growing his business

Her husband works in Kazakhstan. As the main breadwinner of the family, from the time she finished high school 20 years ago, she began working in animal husbandry and growing crops. She started her business with a sum of 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som, buying 1 calf. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now includes 2 dairy cows and 8 sheep. For the purpose of further developing her business, Nazira has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 125,000 Som to buy 1 dairy cow to increase milk production, and 20 sheep for future re-sale. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to develop her business so that she can have the possibility of renovating her house in the future.

Her previous loans were personal, and she now wants to take out a loan to start a new business. She urgently needs to set up a business because her husband works as a driver and earns a small salary. His earnings are not sufficient to provide for their 3 children.
