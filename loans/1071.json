He now knows all the ins and outs of raising cows. He works as a stockman, and all the residents of his village trust him with their herds because he is conscientious and trustworthy person. He pastures the cattle in the mountains. He also has his own cattle which he fattens and re-sells, as there is a big demand in his village. His wife is a homemaker who raises the children, but when Halimjon goes far away into the mountains, she takes care of the cows. Halimjon now wants to increase his herd, and for this reason he has come to Arvand for a loan which he plans to use to buy cattle so he can develop his business.

He would like to invest in the purchase of larger amounts of wood to increase production.\r\n\r\nWayan has been selling through NOVICA since 2001. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I started to learn woodcarving when I was just six years old, together with other children. As a child, I never thought it possible to become an artist. I was lucky to have my father, for he was able to carve and he taught me how to carve.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.

After her wedding in 1993, she began looking for a source of income and got into the field of fattening and re-selling cattle. She also sells milk, having started out with 2 dairy cows that her parents gave as a wedding present. Today, her farm includes 6 dairy cows and 20 horses, and brings in around 25,000 Kyrgyzstan Som each month from the sale of dairy products and re-sale of cattle. For the purpose of further developing her business, Jannat has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 135,000 Som to buy more livestock. She plans to use part of  the income generated by this loan to pay for her children's education, and part will be put towards the expansion of her farm and her children's futures.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1298593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Thanks to persistence and hard work she was able to develop her business so that it now brings in a monthly income of 13,000 som and 70,000 som during the harvest season. Gulmira currently owns two dairy cows, two bulls, and ten sheep and goats. \r\n\r\nGulmira turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a 100,000 loan to purchase more heads of cattle.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. \r\n\r\n In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and from which methane can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

She and her husband are raising four children; their youngest is a two-year-old daughter.  The family mostly works in livestock and agriculture.  Beginning ten years ago with almost nothing, their business now brings in around 20,000 KGS a month from the sale of milk and dairy products.  In the winter time, Gulanda sells fruits and vegetables at a market.  With the goal of increasing the number of animals among her livestock and the work available during spring, Gulanda has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy livestock and fertilizer to cultivate the land for planting.  She plans to use the income from the loan to buy two dairy cows which will allow her to improve her financial position and, in the future, make repairs to her home.

Apong's husband is a hospital labourer, but his income is not enough to fulfill her household needs while all of her children are attending school.\r\nApong, as a member of 2-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner VisionFund Indonesia in order to use it to increase their capital.\r\nFor the past 5 years she has been running her tailoring business. Her income plays a vital role for the family.\r\n\r\nShe wants the financing to purchase tailor utilities; thread, rubber bands, linen-sheet drapery, pillowcase drapery, and some kind of vegetables for her latest business. Presently she is facing a very difficult time because her husband is sick now and she needs more money to buy medicine. She has already sold their vehicle, and needs more money for their children's school fees also. Therefore she hopes that the loan will be a positive one for her so that she can put aside some savings for the future. And she has plans to sell various fish because she has a pond at her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1296610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy material for linen sheets, material for pillows, buy rubber bands, and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cawang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":189,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apong ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wawan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":350000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355942784},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-29T08:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364843337},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-25T08:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048673},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-03T09:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381839891},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:47:34Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698246},{"amount":35.34,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-01T09:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.16,"payment_id":399944647},{"amount":35.23,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.27,"payment_id":410227750},{"amount":34.9,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-26T09:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.6,"payment_id":419991644},{"amount":33.4,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T10:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.1,"payment_id":429644336},{"amount":33.79,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-30T09:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":363900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.71,"payment_id":439871993}],"funded_date":"2013-02-22T21:16:38Z","paid_date":"2014-01-30T09:45:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Serena Driver","image":null}},{"id":530161,"name":"Ridho Slow Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group, called \"Ridho Slow\", is on its second loan cycle.

Her oldest is 18.  She is a trained cook, but considering the low pay, she decided not to pursue this sort of work.  In 1997, she decided to start her own business in livestock.  She began with only 6,000 KGS.  Thanks to her enormous efforts to develop the business, she has found success.  Today, she owns 1 horse, 5 sheep and 5 goats.  Each year, the family farms 15 hectares of land where they plant beans and potatoes.  Their business brings in around 6,000 KGS each month from reselling cattle and between 100,000 and 200,000 KGS per harvest.  In order to further develop her business, Kunduzkan has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 KGS to buy fodder and one dairy cow.  In the future, Kunduzkan dreams of building a home in the city of

old, a widow and is raising 5 children.  The oldest is a 21-year-old daughter.  Since the sudden death of her husband in 2009, Rakhat has worked selling women's clothing.  She started her business with 20,000 KGS.  Now, thanks to her hard work and strong character, she has many clients.  Each month, her income is around 20,000 KGS.  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS to buy women's spring and summer clothing.  She currently doesn't have the variety or inventory to increase her profits.  The loan from Kiva and Bai Tushum will help her.  With the new profits, Rakhat plans to pay her daughter's university tuition.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan to help her continue the operations of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRowena dreams that her business will grow bigger and hopes that her children will finish their studies.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1299057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rowena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":1867,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1898.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037419},{"amount":46.65,"local_amount":1866,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1897.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781936},{"amount":23.35,"local_amount":934,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":949.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894453},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":9333,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":9489.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381670308}],"funded_date":"2013-02-22T23:33:12Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":530256,"name":"Lucita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucita works hard to support six children.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php11, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEdna hopes to have a restaurant someday and dreams of being successful in life.

She will also use it in buying tires. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain her family's daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMary Jane dreams that her children will finish their studies and hopes to buy a pick up. She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1231114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional stock of rice and tires for her business  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-02-22T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-24T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3388.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037427},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6667.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6778.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781944},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6666.98,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6778.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488832},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":8333,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8472.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894461}],"funded_date":"2013-02-23T01:26:41Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":530274,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A $600 loan is sought by Maria to improve her business.

Together with her husband, she has three children who are studying in school. She and her husband work in agriculture planting corn, beans, vegetables, sweet chiles, cucumbers, etc. She does not have any education because her parents had very few resources and were not able to support her, but she learned to work the earth when she was very young. Her parents taught her this activity. Today she, together with her husband, are adding other products for planting. Their produce is sold and marketed in the areas around their home, in the local market and through brokers who certify their produce as healthy, without contamination and not treated with chemicals or other items that make them grow at an accelerated rate. The land that they work on is not their own property because they rent where they live.

She is married to Alvin and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nNancy maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNancy hopes that her business will grow bigger, and she dreams to have a good life. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Fitria has been engaged in her clothing sales venture for three years now.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Fitriah and her group members will be able to expand their businesses, make more sales, and consequently improve their living conditions. Fitira will use her share of the loan (2,500,000 IDR) to buy blouses, jeans, long pants, and Muslim fashion items in larger quantities to add to her current stock and to offer for sale.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to establish a shop and to see her eldest daughter become a flight attendant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1299186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Ahora ya tiene 52 a\u00f1os, es divorciada, situaci\u00f3n que le caus\u00f3 mucho temor en su vida, pero sigui\u00f3 con su vida y ahora vive en el cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. \nMorayma conoce de agricultura desde que es una ni\u00f1a pero emprendi\u00f3 con esta actividad desde hace 30 a\u00f1os, poco despu\u00e9s de haber terminado la secundaria. Invierte todo su d\u00eda en el cuidado de los cultivos y la venta de los mismos. La dificultad que ha tenido con el crecimiento de su negocio es la falta de capital, sin embargo ha encontrado en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa mucha agilidad y preocupaci\u00f3n por la gente de las zonas rurales. Es por esto que decidi\u00f3 solicitar all\u00ed un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar insumos y herramientas que le ayuden a mantener su finca en un estado \u00f3ptimo, de tal forma que los cultivos no se echen a perder, pues en varias ocasiones la falta de atenci\u00f3n a los sembr\u00edos, al suelo, a las cercas y dem\u00e1s, ha ocasionado que cantidades grandes de frutas se desechen. Ella espera que con este mantenimiento mejorado que le dar\u00e1 a la finca su producto se genere en mayores cantidades y as\u00ed poder tener m\u00e1s ingresos de los cuales pueda destinar una cantidad para ahorrar y solventar gastos en sus a\u00f1os de vejez, en los cuales se teme estar\u00e1 sola con el  \u00fanico sustento de su trabajo. Morayma env\u00eda un saludo y mucha gratitud a quienes aportan con sus pr\u00e9stamos en el portal de Kiva  para apoyar los sue\u00f1os de tantas personas en Latinoam\u00e9rica y el mundo que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio. ","en":"Morayma is a woman who has overcome several obstacles throughout her life. She began to work on her parents' farm when she was very young, plowing the land and harvesting the fruits of the cultivated seeds. Now she is 52 years old and divorced, a situation which caused her to have fear in her life. However, she continued on and she now lives in the canton of Santo Domingo in the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. \r\n\r\nSanto Domingo connects the Sierra region with the coastal region of Ecuador. The city has become a hub of commerce, with many sectors experiencing growth. As a testament to this, many enterprising families who started their small business a few years ago are now small business owners who give employment to the next generation. Studies reveal that the majority of businesses began empirically and have been embraced by tourists, entrepreneurs and travelers who go from one region to another. It is also the third most inhabited city in the country.\r\n\r\nMorayma has had knowledge of agriculture since she was a girl, but she started her own business thirty years ago, a short time after finishing secondary school. She invests her entire day in the maintenance and sale of her crops. The difficulty she has had with growing her business is a lack of capital. However, through Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa she has found plenty of flexibility and concern for those who live in rural areas. This is why she decided to apply for a loan through the organization in order to buy supplies and tools which will help her maintain her farm in excellent conditions. This will keep her from losing crops, because on several occasions a lack of attention to the fields, the ground, the fences, and other elements has caused large quantities of fruit to be thrown away. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that with the improved maintenance that she will give to her land, her product will generate larger quantities and she will be able to have a better income. She will then be able to save a certain amount to settle her costs in her elderly years, when she is afraid that she will be alone with only the support from her work. \r\n\r\nMorayma sends her greetings and gratitude to the Kiva lenders, who support the dreams of so many people in Latin America and in the world who have set off with their business ideas.

She has been working in this field for about 11 years and she receives help from her daughter.  What she likes most about her work is that she receives daily income.  It also permits her to set her own schedule and have time to relax.  In the future she would like to have a bigger shop with the tools necessary for completing big projects.  At this time she is asking for a loan of 2000 nuevos soles (Peruvian currency).  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support in order to continuing increasing her capital.  With the requested loan she will purchase materials in order to continue her work, such as fabrics, colored thread, silk and lace, elastic, buttons, zippers, needles, as well as installing a darning machine so that she can put a better finish on her items.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1299715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials for sewing.

His wife and children are most important to him and he does everything he can so his family has everything they need.  Safar is involved in raising livestock.  Since he lives in a rural village, this line of work is very much in demand.  He started working in livestock 16 years ago.  He has a dairy cow which gives 10-12 liters of milk a day.  Safar's wife does the milking and she makes dairy products, which she sells to her neighbors and acquaintances.  She helps her husband in this way.  Since this is his sole source of income, Safar is trying to increase his business and buy one more cow, but at the moment he is in need of money.  At the advice of of his friends, he decided to apply for a loan with Arvand in hopes of fulfilling his plans.

She gets up very early to buy her products wholesale to later sell them retail to the area residents. To do this, she selects the species that are most in demand by her customers, such as boquichico, mullet, and sardine. She also stocks up on those that aren't so much in popular demand but that have a good price in the market, such as doncella  and paiche, always respecting the closed seasons. she has been doing this job for approximately 5 years and she says that with this activity she has been able to feed and raise her children. Now she is working alone and she continues to do so, as it is the only way she has to generate income for her home. What she likes about her job is that she has time to be with her family in the afternoon. she also thinks that working at her age isn't like when she was younger. She has also always been independent and accustomed to doing things on her own. At this time, she is asking for S.\/ 1000 soles.

He started out because he needed work, as he wasn't able to find a stable job. Now he feels more secure because he can manage his own timetable and he is his own boss. One the other hand, he says that he doesn't like it when his motorcycle taxi breaks down or gets damaged continually, because these expenses add up. If he doesn't take care of the problems in time he can't work comfortably.\r\n\r\nStill, his business has been doing well and for this reason he plans to buy another vehicle to rent out and have more secure earnings. He is asking for 1500 soles, with which he will repair his motorcycle taxi, which needs new upholstery and some parts so that it can work well. He will put any leftover money toward the purchase of his next motorcycle taxi.

He is pictured with 15 One Acre Fund farmers: nine women and six men. Dominic is standing on the right in a blue checked shirt with his hand raised. He is receiving an input loan for half an acre of maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation. Dominic joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. He joined One Acre Fund so that he could use his increased profits to send his children to school and to reduce hunger and poverty.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Dominic was only able to harvest six bags of maize per half acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, he was able to harvest 10 bags per half acre!

She works as a teacher in a school. As a means of supplementing her income, in 2005 she started a business in animal husbandry with just 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.)

Since 2000, she has been working in animal husbandry, having started this business with only 10,000 Som. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now includes 4 bulls and 2 cows. In addition, she works a 0.5 hectare plot of land each year. Her monthly income from her business is approximately 15,000 Som.

Her husband works as a truck driver who delivers agriculture products from villages to downtown. The income generated from the business is often insufficient in meeting their household needs. Two years ago, Emilia initiated a kiosk business to help her with additional income. Emilia provides soft drinks, snacks, cigarettes, candies, etc.  However, the limitation of capital has prevented her from selling more goods. After she heard about TLM, Emilia got interested and applied for an IDR 10,000,000 loan for her business improvement. Emilia would like to spend the loan on more goods, i.e,. instant noodles, sugar, rice, coffee, milk, shampoo, bath soap, etc.  In addition, she also wants to buy building materials, i.e,. zinc, cement, sand, etc. to enlarge her kiosk building.

Successful work in animal husbandry and the sale of diary products has allowed Elmira to grow fodder on a 1.16 hectare plot. This enables her to feed her own cattle as well as to earn extra money selling fodder. \r\n\r\nWith future business development in mind, Elmira turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a 30,000 som loan to purchase a dairy cow in order to increase her income from milk sales. Elmira plans to renovate her home with the additional income.

He has a partially-completed education as a technologist in light industry, and has rich experience in this field. For the last 3 years, he has been working as the lead specialist in a tailor studio. Having gained a lot of practical experience and a regular clientele, he decided to open his own tailor studio. To start his business, he rented premises and set up the equipment that he had acquired during the time he worked in the first tailor studio. Yaroslav has proven himself to be a well-mannered and positive person. Before he established his own business, he successfully completed courses in the company \"Senti\" that provides educational classes. In order to provide full service for his clients, Yaroslav needs to buy a buttonhole machine. When he heard about Kiva's advantageous program \"Start Up,\" he approached the Microfinance Bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS) to buy one. An analysis of Yaroslav's business plan indicates that he can earn around 20,000 Som per month. He plans to use the income generated by this loan to re-invest in his business and expand it by purchasing one more machine. He is very happy that such a microfinance program exists and is grateful to all sponsors from Kiva and Bai Tushum & Partners.

Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas. En la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde vive Betty, una mujer de 31 a\u00f1os de edad que fue madre desde muy joven y que decidi\u00f3 vivir con su pareja sin llevar a cabo el contrato de matrimonio, convivencia de la cual nacieron 4 hijos que ahora viven con Betty, ya que ella y su pareja decidieron independizar sus vida y se separaron. Betty tiene aprobada la escuela primaria y trabaja muy duro para que a sus hijos, que estudian actualmente en una escuela fiscal, no les falte nada y puedan un d\u00eda obtener el t\u00edtulo profesional que ella no pudo alcanzar por su falta de recursos.\nBetty no ha limitado su labor a pesar de las barreras que su falta de preparaci\u00f3n le ha puesto en el camino. A ra\u00edz de su separaci\u00f3n, ella es la principal proveedora de sustento en su hogar, es por eso que hace 3 a\u00f1os, con algunos ahorros, instal\u00f3 un local de venta de v\u00edveres y frutas el cual atiende desde que sale el sol hasta la noche, completando hasta 14 horas de trabajo, pero su responsabilidad en el hogar es constante, paralelamente a la atenci\u00f3n de su tienda, ella se las arregla para tener su casa limpia, atender y ayudar a sus hijos y proveerles el alimento diario.

","en":"Each province of Ecuador passes down stories of the men and women who left footprints, forming the future of those who will arrive later. And so, several Ecuadorian cultures lived in the parish of R\u00edo Verde, a historical area of Santo Domingo, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a province of Ecuador that in recent years has had a sustained high growth. Its capital is a city with the most attractive, appealing and delicious fruit and gastronomy offered there. It also has considerable trade and has become a land port of trade between the mountain ranges and the coastal regions. It also has many tourist attractions accompanied by a warm climate which is frequented by both national and international tourists. It is for this reason that most of its inhabitants have embarked on some commercial activity or service for residents and tourists. \r\n\r\nBetty lives in the parish of R\u00edo Verde. She is a 31 year old woman who became a mother at a very young age and decided to live with her partner without a marriage license, and they had four children who now live with Betty, as she and her partner decided to separate and become independent of one another. Betty has a primary school certificate and works very hard for her children who currently attend a public school. They do not require anything and they can one day receive a professional title that she could not because of the absence of resources. Betty has not been limited in her work because of her lack of preparation by the obstacles placed on her path.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of her separation, she is the main provider for household expenses. This is why three years ago, with some savings, she opened a grocery and fruit stand and attends to it from sunrise until sunset, working 14 hours a day. But her household responsibilities are constant and at the same time that she tends to her store she also cleans the house and takes care of the children providing them with their daily bread.\r\n\r\nHer experience has taught her that it is important to always have a selection of products in sufficient quantity, otherwise customers will search for other alternatives, and this is why Betty is asking for a loan in order to buy products to meet the demand of her clients and to attract more people to shop at her store, fitting it out attractively and comfortably for her and the people who come to her place. Thanks to your help, Betty will be able to give her children a quality life without passing up necessities and furthermore Betty will grow personally and professionally."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1299737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and make repairs for the growth of her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-02-23T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-25T18:00:06Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty Seneida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1570.5,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":131.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":147.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":151.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":156.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":159.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":162.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":169.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":172.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":132.23,"local_amount":131.85,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":132.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494988},{"amount":147.86,"local_amount":147.44,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":147.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524918},{"amount":151.6,"local_amount":151.17,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":151.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133222},{"amount":153.77,"local_amount":153.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":153.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313760},{"amount":157.43,"local_amount":156.98,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":157.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565367},{"amount":159.91,"local_amount":159.45,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":159.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814407},{"amount":672.2,"local_amount":670.28,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":672.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320583}],"funded_date":"2013-03-03T10:42:06Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":530490,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam, age 34, owns and operates a clothing sales business.

","en":"Bisharofat is a kind and responsible young woman. She is married and has 2 children. When she was a child, she dreamed of becoming a doctor, but unfortunately her dream could not be realised because her father died young and she had to give up her studies to help her mother at home. She is now married and works as a cook in a cafe, and her husband repairs cars at an autobody shop. This family has a small house that hasn't been renovated in a long time. Now the house is in poor shape and the facilities are in bad condition, which is why Bisharofat is seeking a loan to repair it. She wants her children to have comfortable living conditions. She will use the loan money to buy building materials so she can begin renovations. She is very happy that this dream can come true.

","en":"Zokir and his family live high up in the mountains.  He is in the business of raising cattle.  This is Zokir's only business because, in the mountains, raising cattle is the only thing that works.  He is the only breadwinner for his family.  Zokir has a very difficult life, but he doesn't give up and he is trying to develop his business.  He knows that if he loses heart, his family will not survive.  So, Zokir tries to keep moving forward and to never despair.  \r\n\r\nOnce every two weeks, Zokir takes his cattle to the market where he sells them and he immediately buys calves.  Right now, he has 10 head of cattle.  He is planning to increase the size of his herd, but he does not have sufficient financial means to do so.  Because of this, Zokir applied to MDO Arvand for financial support.  \r\n\r\nZokir wants to use his loan to buy one more calf, which he will raise and fatten for sale at an advantageous price this spring.  He is reliant on MDO Arvand's support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1287910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He earns his living selling coal and he's been in business for 10 years.  He started his business with ten bags of coal, but now he buys it up by the ton.  There is a strong demand for coal right now because it's winter and many people heat their homes with it.

","en":"Masturajon is a young woman and a loving mother of 1 child. Unfortunately, her husband divorced her 1 year ago and she is raising her daughter by herself. Of course her parents help her, but this doesn't make up for not having a man's shoulder to lean on. From an early age, Masturajon loved to sew and embroider. When she grew up, she completed dressmaking courses, and she is now a professional seamstress and has a lot of clients. She buys fabric at a wholesale market then sews national traditional dresses, embroiders them with various designs, then sells them to her clients. She is very skilled at sewing and this ability allows her to earn a living. Masturajon has approached Arvand for a loan to buy furniture and a fridge. She wants to furnish her apartment with the necessities. She is hoping for financial support from Arvand.

She is currently single but has two young children, aged two and eight years old.  She lives with them at her parents' house.  Liz makes a living selling catalog beauty products, such as cosmetics and perfumes.  She sells them to friends, relatives and other people that she knows.  A lot of the time people pay in cash, while others pay in installments.  She has good results in this work and also has a good customer base.  She has had the business nearly three years and has always worked alone.  What Liz likes about the business is that she can manage her free time and so spend the necessary time with her young children.  Moreover she likes generating her own income and using it to pay household bills.  However, she says it bothers her when customers are late with payments though it does not discourage her.  She plans to continue work as she feels good and satisfied with her business. It gives her the independence she needs.  On this occasion, Liz is applying for 1100 Nuevo Soles to stock up on cosmetics and buy different perfumes, talcum powders, creams and some jewellery.

For the past four years, Aida has been working hard to manage her boutique, which acquires ladies' clothes for sale. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Aida has requested a loan of 300000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to improve on the business and buy more cartons of clothes to sell, and will help Aida generate greater profits and catch the attention of other customers. Aida hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nAida is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

woman. She is married and has 3 children. Her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation, and she has been working in food sales for the past 2 years. The money that her husband sends home is not sufficient to provide for the family, so Bunafsha tries to make it through the hard times on her own. She travels to the city to stock up on inventory herself, and her eldest son helps her out with the business even though he is only 12 years old. Her dream is for her children to grow up without wanting for anything. This year she wants to use her savings to carry out major renovations to her apartment, but the money she has put by will not be enough to cover such expenses, which is why she wants to increase her turnover and expand her business. Bunafsha will use the loan she receives from Arvand to purchase a wide variety of groceries to sell. She hopes to save up enough money so that in 6 months' time she can begin renovating her apartment.

He put heating in all his greenhouses, installed  a large boiler, and this allowed him to increase his income. Thanks to these earnings, he was able to pay for his daughter's medical care. She had a curvature of the spine for which she was hospitalised and underwent massage therapy. Now her situation has markedly improved. This time, Stanislav is seeking a loan of 23,000 Ukrainian Hryvnya to buy fertilizer, coal, and plastic covering for his greenhouses for the new season. He hopes that buying coal and properly insulating his greenhouses will allow him to get an earlier harvest that he can sell quickly. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1299677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer, coal, and plastic covering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-02-23T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-25T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stanislav","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":11500},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":11500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":619.57,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5042.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372947069},{"amount":805.43,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6554.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726623},{"amount":1425,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-25T08:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":11596.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589758}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T17:09:34Z","paid_date":"2013-08-25T08:38:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":530508,"name":"Tamaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tamaz is 35 years old.

She has 3 children with ages ranging from 2 years to 7 years. She describes herself to be courageous and jovial woman. She operates a general store where she sells home products, cereals and provides M-pesa services (a mobile-phone based money transfer and microfinancing service). She has been involved in this business for 4 years. \r\n\r\nHer business is located at a densely populated area and her primary customers are local residents.

He grows beans and corn for a living and he also grows loroco to supplement the household expenses.  He has been in farming for many years and he is proud because he has been able to gain a lot of experience, which allows him to improve his harvests day by day.  He owns the land he plants on and it is located in a very agricultural area.  He gets all of his family's help; they help him sell in all the neighboring areas and he has a big clientele because people prefer him for the quality of his produce, his good prices, and his good service.  Hugo is an enterprising man who is dedicated to his work.  He is constantly looking to better himself and succeed.

She is pictured with her group -- 17 One Acre Fund farmers, 15 women and 2 men. Phelesia is standing on the right, with her hand raised. She is receiving an input loan for \u00bd acre of maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation. Phelesia joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. Phelesia joined One Acre Fund so that she could grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nPhelesia reports that before One Acre Fund, she was able to grow about two bags of maize per \u00bd acre, but with her One Acre Fund input loan during Long Rains 2012, she harvested six bags per 1\/2 acre!

Deo would like the lender to continue with the partnership, to enable his dreams to come true.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1299407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials for completion of his family's house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kagadi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":107099.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589858},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:02:15Z","rounded_local_amount":107099.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993818},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":107099.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040521},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107099.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831151},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":107099.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689373}],"funded_date":"2013-02-24T02:37:30Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:58:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":530577,"name":"Maitta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maitta is 28 years-old and lives in Kakata the capital city of Margibi County which is the highest producer of rubber plantation in Liberia.

She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

She is married and has two children, aged 35 and 30. In 2000, she established her butcher shop business. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy chickens for her shop. In the future, Surja Maya plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. In Nepal, the meat is always fresh.
