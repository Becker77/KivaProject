The land he cultivates is located in a zone where agriculture is common, very close to the area where he lives. He sells in all of the nearby places, and he has a lot of customers, because everything he sells is of top quality and at affordable prices, and the service is also excellent. Pedro is an enterprising man with a great desire to get ahead. He is always looking out for new opportunities that arise. In the last harvest he had losses, and he wants to recover from them. For this reason he is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL which will permit him to buy corn and sorghum seeds, fertilizer, insecticide, etc. Pedro Antonio has good credit references and is very responsible. He is very grateful for the help with this, and he promises to pay the debt, while at the same time he will give his family a better quality of life, full of the comforts they deserve.

For many years, he's been in the business of growing staple crops, specifically, corn, beans, and sorghum, though he also owns a small store and a tailor shop. This allows him to put food on the table every day in his home. Through raising his crops he is able to go on sustaining his family year after year. Oscar is a very hardworking man of whom many people speak highly, selling part of his crop each season to bring in the income he needs to cover various household expenses.  \r\n\r\nHis hope is to invest a little more in his agricultural work to achieve a larger crop of staples that will allow him to improve his sales and his income. That's why he decided to get involved with INTEGRAL; to buy some agriculture materials, such as manure, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc, and invest in a better crop and realize his goal of improving his and his family's living conditions. He puts his trust in God and in his hard work to achieve success. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1300465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy invest in agriculture materials, such as manure, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc,","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T04:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T04:00:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Atilio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459010405}],"funded_date":"2013-02-26T05:38:23Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T09:00:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacob Bintliff","image":789150}},{"id":530749,"name":"Anastacia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anastacia is 70 years old and lives in Poblacion, Panaon, Misamis Occidental.

She previously took out a loan of PHP 8,000 to increase her stock of grocery items and products for her business. Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and her personal, household, and business expenses. She also sells street food like fish balls and egg balls for additional income.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another loan of PHP 8,000 to buy groceries, toiletries, drinks, and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed in the store, the better because more items to sell will result in higher profits. Her profits from business will help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense.

In the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1299836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery goods for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Chappagaun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T05:40:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-01T09:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913275},{"amount":10.41,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-29T08:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364624252},{"amount":10.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-29T09:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020252},{"amount":10.35,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.07,"payment_id":381808081},{"amount":10.1,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":390668144},{"amount":9.81,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":400621660},{"amount":9.98,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":410196543},{"amount":9.75,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"payment_id":419959992},{"amount":39.9,"local_amount":3333.36,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3607.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.77,"payment_id":429613885}],"funded_date":"2013-02-24T05:45:52Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":530779,"name":"Amelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amelita is 44 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nAmelita works hard to provide for her family.

Also, they have livestock in the countryside and add to their assets by purchasing livestock each year.  His daughter goes to elementary school. The house they live in needs some outer and interior repair. So he is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase bricks, roofing material, cement and dry boards.

Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

He is married and has a son who is just one year old.  Gino lives alongside his wife and siblings in his parents' house.  He makes a living editing audio and video tracks for television and radio programs that are well-known in the region.  In addition he rents out his sound and some other equipment for festivals and social events in the city.  Part of his work consists of making adverts, photo shoots, narrating documentaries, and such like.  He does this work at his mother's house as there he has a small office.  He has had this business for three years and feels it is going well as the number of customers has multiplied.  What Gino likes about his work is that he is making a good income and that he has fun doing it - this type of work is something that has fascinated him since he was a boy.  In the time that he has been doing this work, Gino has learned many things and he is continually training himself to use new sound and design technology.  His main goal is to have a fully equipped recording studio.  In the meantime he is buying some of the tools that he needs for his work, little by little.  On this occasion he is applying for a loan of 1500 Nuevo Soles.  With this money he will buy new cables that he needs to update, he will repair a speaker and buy coloured light bulbs that he needs for renting out."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1300675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy cables and repair music equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T08:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T08:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":230.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":237.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":246.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":248},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":264.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":272.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.34,"local_amount":230.85,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-20T08:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":238.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123137},{"amount":94.97,"local_amount":237.43,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":245.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868987},{"amount":98.51,"local_amount":246.28,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":254.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577827},{"amount":99.2,"local_amount":248,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":256.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530058},{"amount":105.89,"local_amount":264.72,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":273.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975089},{"amount":109.09,"local_amount":272.72,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":281.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996358}],"funded_date":"2013-02-25T00:02:19Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":530789,"name":"Conchita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Conchita is 61 years old and married with seven children.

now. They have brought up three children, two of which are currently in school. The kids and wife help Pablo out on the farm during peak harvest season, which for cacao picks up in January to May. To harvest cacao, farmers use a hook knife or machete to cut the fruit off the trunk. Once the pod is cracked open the sweet pulp surrounding cacao beans starts fermenting and needs to be put into wooden boxes for fermentation. \n\nPablo was inspired to start farming cacao because of the stable market access and an attractive price. He saw it as an opportunity because cacao is a permanent crop and will start producing pods after about four years and continue for decades thereafter. Apart from cacao, the family also plants corn and beans for home use.\n\nThe favorite part of cacao farming for Pablo is harvesting because it does not require a lot of work. The challenging part, however, is cleaning because it requires a lot of time, and besides farming Pablo also works in a shrimp farm. \n\nThe family is requesting the loan to hire five men for ten days to clean their cacao farm. Cleaning is the process of clearing the underbrush in the cacao field and its surroundings to clear access for pruning, harvesting or planting alongside them. Because of ample growth in the lush tropical lowlands of Belize, cleaning is an especially strenuous activity that needs to be repeated every three months. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1300587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To clean two acres of cacao","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971175},{"amount":52.64,"local_amount":95.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":103.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751700},{"amount":26.52,"local_amount":48.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993441},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":48.46,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255610},{"amount":23.01,"local_amount":41.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":45.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136450},{"amount":30.7,"local_amount":55.81,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":60.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900667},{"amount":27.05,"local_amount":49.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":53.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088548},{"amount":62.31,"local_amount":113.28,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":122.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673287}],"funded_date":"2013-02-24T15:12:46Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":530837,"name":"Debora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Debora is a 48-year-old entrepreneur.

She is the mother of two children who she has raised and educated alone as she has been divorced for some time. She lives in her own home and works a lot as she wants to offer her children a better quality of life. Doris works selling used second hand clothes. Her work begins with buying articles of clothing from various people or in the city market, selecting those that are in the best condition. Later, she divides these into women's clothes and men's clothes, and, finally, she separates the children's clothes from the adult's clothes. \r\nOnce a month, she travels with a friend to the villages and population centers to sell her merchandise. She has been running this business for 13 years and it is doing very well. In addition, she has a small grocery store where she sells fruits, drinks, and candies to her neighbors from the place where she looks after her children. She likes her work because she can travel to different places. She thinks that the most difficult thing is that she has to go out very early in the morning and it can be dangerous at that time. She remembers that she began this business because of the low income her household had. But, once she started selling used clothes, things improved a lot. Now, she also sometimes sells new clothes that she buys from another city and she hopes to continue with this new line in order to improve her profits. At this time, she is requesting $775. She is grateful to all the people who have made this loan possible as she feels secure in growing her business. She will used the requested funds to buy more clothes so she can continue her business selling clothes to the distant towns of her region. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1300691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy second hand clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":307.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":316.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":328.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":330.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":352.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":365.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":119.17,"local_amount":307.54,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-20T08:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":307.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123141},{"amount":122.56,"local_amount":316.29,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":316.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868991},{"amount":127.14,"local_amount":328.09,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577831},{"amount":128.02,"local_amount":330.37,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":330.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530062},{"amount":136.65,"local_amount":352.65,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":352.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975093},{"amount":141.46,"local_amount":365.06,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":365.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996362}],"funded_date":"2013-02-27T21:20:39Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":530838,"name":"Lucena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucena, age 44, operates a general store business to earn an income.

Even though Sarlintje\u2019s husband has a permanent job, the income does not fully cover all the living expenses including the children\u2019s school fees. This is the reason why Sarlintje started a kiosk business several years ago.

To implement her dream, Sarlintje requested a loan from TLM of IDR 10,000,000.

His biggest challenges are poultry diseases and expensive poultry feeds. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Lelmet and Mrembo. He will use the loan to buy poultry birds.\r\n\r\nLeonard was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied it is because they gives loans to small scale farmers at a lower interest rate.  He was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.  He answered he learned that they are short term loans.\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit your family Leonard replied that he will get income to be able to educate and feed my children.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Leonard owns the following a cow, poultry, and bicycle but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

He has nine children and has been doing this work for 11 years.  His primary income sources are milk, crops, employer pension, and personal business. He will use the loan requested to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Feeding dairy cows so as to produce more milk'. His biggest challenges are: 'Water, diseases and dairy feeds during dry seasons.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Grace, Mama Safi and Maayi.'\r\n\r\nDavid was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Because Juhudi Kilimo finances farmers and being a farmer, I found Juhudi able to finance my farming activities.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Importance of using loans for the intended projects.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', David replied, 'I will be able to educate my grandchildren, provide my family with good health care, and also feed my family.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. David owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, sewing machine' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

Animals on the farm have been given the names of \"Maua.\"\r\n\r\nPaul was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, and he answered, \"Because it finances and gives loans to farmers at a lower interest rate as compared to other MFIs, which do not deal with asset financing.\" He learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session that the loans offered \"are short term loans for small scale farming and businesses.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked \"How will this loan benefit your family?\", Paul replied, \"Money from the sale of milk will help supplement my other income so that I can pay school fees for my children.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Paul stated that he owns \"cow, poultry, bicycle\" but does not own \"pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile.\" Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household \"mosquito net, electricity, TV, DVD\" but does not have \"solar power, running water, sewing machine.\"\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used

He states that the loan will certainly help him increase his business productivity by a fair percentage, which will return to him higher profits. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Rabih plans to take more Kiva loans and expand his lands by cultivating a wider variety of fruits and vegetables.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1299953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth"],"use":"to purchase the required agricultural tools and supplies, seeds, and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":115,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rabih","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355944097},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364664236},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-22T08:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373049556},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-25T08:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840755},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390699001},{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399945218}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T18:20:25Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T19:11:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":530885,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience is a 38-year-old mother of four children, aged 7, 10, 12, and 15 years. \r\n\r\nPatience sells fruits and vegetables in Kaloleni town.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBezhan opened a grocery shop recently where he sells different kinds of groceries and is grinding coffee as well. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nBezhan requested a loan for purchasing more stock of groceries, which will help his newly started business to develop. He will reinvest the profit in the same business. This will help him and his family to have better living conditions.  \r\n

She is 54 years old and married, and lives with her two daughters, who are adults, and her husband. She is a merchant by trade. She has had her own business, which she set up with her own money by sparing no effort, for five years. It consists in a small shoemaker's workshop with two employees that makes women's shoes, and in a small grocery shop that sells meals in the evenings. Francisca works both businesses together with her husband in order to improve their lot in life. She says she likes to try out new ideas for her business and to earn her money honestly, since that is how she was brought up. At this juncture, she needs to invest in her workshop, since she is facing an increase in custom. This is why she asks for a loan in order to buy the materials she needs to make shoes: Brazilwood, mirrors, cloth, black varnish, straw soles, fine cloth, velvet, thread, felt, white glue, yellow glue, rubber soles, and others. This will enable her to face demand. She sells sandals at the town market and her grocery shop is located at her home, her customers being mainly neighbours. A few years ago, Francisca took out a loan with the same field partner, which she repaid in due time. She is asking for another loan in order to improve her and her family's financial situation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1299012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy the materials she needs to make shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-02-24T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-26T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":439},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":624.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":641.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":675.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":696.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":724.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":759.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":782.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":822.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.81,"local_amount":439,"processed_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":459.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364494059},{"amount":26.77,"local_amount":624.56,"processed_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":653.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115354},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":641.63,"processed_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":671.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675015},{"amount":28.94,"local_amount":675.21,"processed_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":706.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539294},{"amount":29.83,"local_amount":696.06,"processed_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":728.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788533},{"amount":31.06,"local_amount":724.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":758.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410064867},{"amount":32.53,"local_amount":759.05,"processed_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":794.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419828755},{"amount":33.56,"local_amount":782.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":819.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430384545},{"amount":35.27,"local_amount":822.94,"processed_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":861.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978306},{"amount":35.73,"local_amount":833.81,"processed_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":872.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449611900}],"funded_date":"2013-02-24T19:38:36Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:44:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":530913,"name":"Nyadzua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nyadzua is a 32-year-old married woman.

She has been a merchant in an area of the capital for five years, and sells braised fish. Her business is flourishing thanks to her know-how in the field and her experience, which have allowed her over time to expand her business and acquire a faithful clientele.

She has two additional dependents, who live with her to assist her in domestic work, and also to be fostered.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruth established her business, after having completed her tertiary education. She decided to engage in a business, the experience of which she had gotten from her mother, and which she believed would be profitable. Her mother gave her the capital to start a business selling groundnuts. The business has since grown to include selling pure water and soft drinks. Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,805,000 every month from this business.\r\n\r\nRuth would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000. She requires a loan in order to buy more pure water and soft drinks to resell. Ruth plans to educate her children, open a shop, build a house, and become an international business woman, in the future.  The loan will improve the business. Inadequate capital, and slow sales in the rainy season, are her major challenges. She is a hard-working and trustworthy businesswoman.

She is married and has four children ages five, six and fourteen. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her to assist with the house chores.  \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Margarette established her textiles business. She began her business because she wanted to assist her husband in taking care of the home. Her business is located in the city center and her main customers are adults. \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and ten hours a day, Margarette earns about SLL 2,500,000 every month from this business.

She is a hardworking and ambitious woman. Since childhood, she has been learning from her mother how to sew national coats for men called \"jomah\". She has a rich imagination and skillful hand.\r\n\r\nMastura is married and has two children. Since her husband's income is not enough to provide the family with all the necessary means, Mastura decided to establish her own business.\r\n\r\nWith this goal, she took a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate.

It has been a profitable endeavor and is the only source of income for the family.  Shifa is requesting a loan of $700 from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs to insure and license the taxi.  In addition, this loan will help the family cover some of the taxi-related expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1298469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay to insure and license the taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":"Jenin City-West Bank","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2013-02-25T07:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":65.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.57},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.4,"local_amount":51.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":51.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356569171},{"amount":52.57,"local_amount":52.57,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":52.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373561268},{"amount":53.76,"local_amount":53.76,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":53.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382380223},{"amount":54.98,"local_amount":54.98,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":54.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391486491},{"amount":56.23,"local_amount":56.23,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":56.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400465382},{"amount":57.51,"local_amount":57.51,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":57.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410194844},{"amount":58.82,"local_amount":58.82,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":58.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419958216},{"amount":314.73,"local_amount":314.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T10:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":314.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430465948}],"funded_date":"2013-02-25T22:01:41Z","paid_date":"2013-12-21T10:31:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":530127,"name":"Tureme Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"J.Marie fait partie du groupe Tureme et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

Two of her children are in school.\n\nMarie Marguerite has been involved in retail and wholesale commerce for the past 17 years.  Depending on the season, she sells fresh produce (fruits) at a local market.  She knows her suppliers and especially her customers very well, for having built her customer base over time, thanks to her experience in this field.  However, because of her small capital, she is constantly out-of-stock since she has to sell off her stock before she can buy more merchandise.\n\nMarie Marguerite would like to increase her stock of fruits, which will allow her to better meet the constant demand from her customers.  A larger stock will also prevent stock shortages and will help her to increase her profits.  \n\nMarie Marguerite intends to save her profits, not only to expand her activity, but also to meet her family's needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1296799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to increase her stock of fruits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2013-02-25T07:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-27T07:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Marguerite","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10434},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10808},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11184},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11561},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11937},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12312},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12689},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13065},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":13441},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":13816},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14192},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14561}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.61},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.86},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.61,"local_amount":10434,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":10925.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356623263},{"amount":23.41,"local_amount":10808,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":11317.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437401},{"amount":24.24,"local_amount":11184,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-25T08:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":11710.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842451},{"amount":25.05,"local_amount":11561,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-31T08:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12105.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381610465},{"amount":25.86,"local_amount":11937,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12499.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390468009},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":12312,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12892.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399724009},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12689,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T08:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":13286.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409993006},{"amount":28.31,"local_amount":13065,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T09:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":13680.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419757592},{"amount":29.12,"local_amount":13441,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":14074.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429407667},{"amount":92.23,"local_amount":42569,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-04T09:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":44574.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520466279}],"funded_date":"2013-02-25T13:05:35Z","paid_date":"2014-09-04T09:29:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":524027,"name":"Rosalindo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalindo is married with 1 child.

","en":"Aliya is 45 years old and married with two children.  Her husband is on disability.  As a source of income for her family, Aliya and her husband got started in livestock and farming in 1985.

She is married and has four children, aged 8, 5, 3, and 1 year. Two of the children are school-going children.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bassie established her general store business, selling items like peak milk, mayonnaise, sardine, sweets, batteries, biscuits, cigarettes, and soap. She began her business because she did not attend school, her parents being people who did not see value in educating a girl child.  She used to assist her mother in business.  After she got married, her husband opened a shop for her to run.  Working 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, she earns about SLL 2,158,000 every month from this business.\r\n\r\nBassie would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Bassie requires a loan in order to buy inventory, like Ovaltine, powered milk, baby food, sweets, cigarettes, toilet paper, soap, and batteries.

He is married and has three children, aged 14, 12, and 5 years. Two of them are school-going children. He has one additional dependent, who lives with him because she is attending school.\n\nIn 2003, Abdul established his clothing business. He began his business because he dropped out of school, due to a lack of financial support. His uncle advised Abdul to join him in his business, because it was the only way he could help him. He had no alternative but to join his uncle, and trade with him from place to place. He worked with his uncle until years later, when he started his own business. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about SLL 925,000 every month from this business.\n\nAbdul would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,500,000.

runners. She has 8 children and has been doing this work for 10 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, among other crops.\n\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Feeding my dairy cow!' Her biggest challenge is 'Transportation of milk to the market.' One of the animals in the farm is named \u201clelmo\u201d.\n\nMary was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Fair interest rates.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'managing farming as a business.'\n\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Mary replied 'More disposable income and better nutrition for the children.'\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Mary owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

She also earns additional income from the rental houses owned by the family. The area has a large population, most of whom work on the island and return to the mainland in the evenings, with little time to prepare meals. \r\n\r\nAsha learned about Milango through advertisements. She joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations. Her main challenges are price fluctuations. Asha is applying for a loan of 43,200 Kenya shillings to buy retail and food stock such as rice, cereals, wheat flour, cooking oil, etc. Asha will use the extra income from the loan for savings, to improve her family's living standard and to pay school fees for her children.

He followed the example, and the business has prospered under his management. He wants to keep growing. He works in the store every day form 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. He buys from granaries, where he is well-known and offered good prices. Daily, he tries to convince customers to shop at Marlon's. Since he is the owner, he doesn't have to pay rent, which means he has more income to help his family.
