They both dream of seeing them become successful, and, for this reason, Dirianis and her husband work hard to give them the best life they can. Three years ago, with some money they had saved, they started a business selling desserts and hamburgers. Dirianis\u2019s mother helped them with her suggestions and experience. They managed to grow little by little and are now very well-known in the areas where they sell. Their main customers are people from the local neighborhood and areas close by, to whom they sell to daily, door-to-door, and on short-term credit. \r\n\r\nThe demand for their products is gradually increasing, and they do not have enough money to invest to be able to increase their number of customers or to be able to expand into other markets that could help their growth. This is the biggest challenge that they are facing, and that is why they have come to Kiva for their first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which they will buy sauces, meat, and bread products to have enough supplies to make products for their potential customers. \r\n\r\nTheir dream is to buy their own house to be able to give their family their own roof to live under peacefully.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1301436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sauces, meat, and bread products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-02-25T16:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-27T16:10:12Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dirianis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":830000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":74653},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":76395},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78178},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80002},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":81869},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83779},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":85734},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87734},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89781},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.72,"local_amount":74653,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":77092.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498029},{"amount":43.72,"local_amount":76395,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":78891.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527845},{"amount":44.74,"local_amount":78178,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":80732.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928590},{"amount":45.79,"local_amount":80002,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":82616.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705741},{"amount":46.85,"local_amount":81869,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-25T08:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84544.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968031},{"amount":47.95,"local_amount":83779,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":86516.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817228},{"amount":49.06,"local_amount":85734,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":88535.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323500},{"amount":50.21,"local_amount":87734,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":90600.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082740},{"amount":51.38,"local_amount":89781,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":92714.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062118},{"amount":52.58,"local_amount":91875,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":94877.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731814}],"funded_date":"2013-02-27T01:18:55Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geraldine Pugh","image":null}},{"id":531699,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al sur de la ciudad de Barranquilla y se dedica a la actividad comercial;

She lives with her parents. \r\n\r\nIn search of additional sources of income for her family, Azikul started her own animal husbandry business in 1968 with an initial investment of 5,000 som. Thanks to persistent work Azikul now has two cows, two bulls, four calves, and two horses on her farm. Her monthly income from diary and meat products as well as the resale of cattle is about 35,000 som. \r\n\r\nWith long-term business development in mind, Azikul turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 som to purchase four bulls. She plans to use the additional income to invest in increasing her head of cattle. In the long-term, she plans to make her long-time dream of purchasing a family car come true.

In search of income for her family, Rahat five years ago began her own business in the production of bread and hot drinks (tea, coffee, cocoa) to trade in the market, starting with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Through hard and persistent effort and because of her positive and jovial character, Rahat has many loyal customers.\n\nIn order to further develop her business, Rahat appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to expand inventory and her retail space.

He breeds cows and steers and sells milk and milk products as well as cattle for meat purposes to local butchers. Miralakbar has 10 years of experience in this field, thank to his father who taught him best how to look after cattle.\r\n\r\nMiralakbar usually buys calves, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months and resells them for a more profitable price from his house.  Milk and yoghurt are sold to the neighbors. Milk and meat selling brings in 150 AZN in income per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as meat are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes as 'pilau' and 'dolma' and always use yoghurt in sauces.

As a means of earning income for her family, she raises cattle and grows crops. She started this business 11 years ago with a sum of 5,000 Kyrgyzstan Som. Since then, she has managed to expand her farm which now includes 2 dairy cows, 1 horse and 2 heifers, and brings in a monthly income of around 7,000 Som from the sale of milk and re-sale of cows. In addition, she works 0.55 hectares of irrigated land. For the purpose of further developing her business, Kamiila has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 Som to buy 3 heifers to fatten and re-sell in the future. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to increase her herd and to purchase furniture for her house.

She lives with her husband in Koutiala City. She did not have the chance to be educated, and so she became interested in commerce at an early age. She learned about commerce from her mom. After having run several revenue-generating businesses, she has now opted for selling peanuts, peanut butter, soaps, cakes, etc. \r\n\r\nTo increase her business capital, so as to expand her business, Assitan turned toward the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso seven years ago.

","en":"Najmiddin is 46 years old, married, and has three children.  He's a man with many positive qualities.  He's a very kind and responsible person.  When he was a child, he dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur.  Now that he's grown, he buys and sells men's clothing and footwear and he enjoys this work very much.  Najmiddin imports clothing to his village from another city and sells them in his store.  His wife does not have a job outside of the home and focuses on raising their children.  \n\nThis business is the sole source of income for the family.  For this reason, Najmiddin is trying to develop his business and save money for his children's future.

His primary crop is pomegranates, which are considered by  Azerbaijani people as very healthy, especially  fresh  pomegranate juice. People use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy; many national dishes are made of vegetable, like 'pilau' and 'dolma'. Fresh fruit is served on every table in the Azerbaijan family and also made into fresh punch.\r\n\r\nZaur sells his crops in the bazaar. His monthly income is 90 AZN.

He is specializing in selling different types of plastics that customers request and buy for their home use.\r\n\r\nYasser is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from Palestine for Credit & Development (FATEN) to cover the cost of purchasing more plastics for his store. Taking this loan will increase sales and improve Yasser's income positively, so he could live with his family in better conditions. Yasser is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. \r\n\r\nFATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see in fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. \r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim

He breeds cows and cattle and sells milk and milk products, as well as cattle for meat purposes to local butchers.  There are about eight head in his herd.  Sakit has five years of experience in this field, and the reason which pushed him to start his own business was a very low pension.\r\n\r\nSakit usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, and resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar. Milk and yoghurt he sells to the neighbors. Milk and meat selling brings an income of 400 AZN per month. \r\n\r\nMilk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce.

She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm-sized ones to the much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Donata's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Donata continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nDonata hopes to expand her business and have more products to sell. She dreams that her children will finish their studies.

","en":"Julia is 53 years old and was born in a small part of the city of Loja.  Her family was of limited financial resources so they were only able to pay for her to complete elementary school and receive a basic education.  She married Jose when she was very young.  He\u2019s now 63 years old and a farmer.  They have five children and have provided them with everything they needed so that they could become independent and work on their own.  She currently lives with her husband in the Santo Domingo settlement of the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province.  Santo Domingo is located along the mountain and coastal regions of Ecuador, and is in a commercially strategic zone, very convenient for large and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nJulia has been a housewife since she married and has also been helping her husband work on the crops.  However nine years ago she saw that the household needs had increased greatly when she was diagnosed with uterine cancer and she had to cover various costs for this treatment.  It would have been easy for Julia to give up and use her illness as a reason to quit working, however this woman has not slowed down despite her age and illness.  Each day she goes out to walk along the streets of her city and offer casual clothing, table cloths, and curtains to her customers and also to collect on bills from previous sales.  Julia needs to grow her business and needs more merchandise.  This will help her increase her income and be able to cover the cost of her lab fees, medicine, and special food that her cancer treatment requires.  Julia needs this loan to be able to buy clothing and products.  Thanks to some of her friends\u2019 recommendations Julia has approached Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, who aside from the speed and trust, have they have made this loan possible very easily.  This is her first loan and she expects to be on time with her payments.  She is grateful to Kiva, who has made this loan possible.

Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nLeonel tuvo familiares que se han dedicado desde siempre a la distribuci\u00f3n de arroz al por mayor a las tiendas, micromercados y dep\u00f3sitos tanto dentro como fuera de la ciudad. Leonel sigui\u00f3 el ejemplo de ellos y se dedica a esta actividad desde hace 5 a\u00f1os. \u00c9l se encarga de recorrer la ciudad y las afueras ofreciendo el producto y tomando pedidos de sus clientes frecuentes. En el espacio de la casa que arrienda y que lo ha destinado al negocio, Leonel recibe el producto en los quintales y los prepara para salir a recorrer la ciudad entregando el producto y adem\u00e1s cobrando a sus clientes. Leonel sue\u00f1a con tener su propia casa en donde pueda construir un dep\u00f3sito de arroz con algunos v\u00edveres adicionales y as\u00ed poder crecer y dar empleo a otras personas. Para lograr este sue\u00f1o Leonel se ha propuesto incrementar sus ventas y crear un ahorro con el dinero extra que reciba, para esto Leonel solicita un pr\u00e9stamo el cual ser\u00e1 utilizado 100% para hacer pedidos m\u00e1s grandes y poder atender las demanda de sus clientes. Leonel les agradece a todos quienes a trav\u00e9s de Kiva y Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa  le ayudan a financiar sus sue\u00f1os y as\u00ed poder continuar con la manutenci\u00f3n de sus hijos y poderlos ver convertidos en profesionales de excelencia alg\u00fan d\u00eda. ","en":"Leonel is a man who was born in the warm part of Ecuador, in the town of Los Bancos, where he spent his childhood and, thanks to the effort of his parents, was able to complete primary school. He worked with his parents since he was very young, and he married, forming a household with two children, who are now attending a public school. With time, things did not go as he hoped, and he made the decision to separate from his wife. It was a very hard time for him and his family. In any case, it was overcome, and Leonel continued working so that his children would not lack for anything. Now Leonel lives in the Rio Verde parish, a historic part of Santo Domingo, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a province of Ecuador that in recent years has had high sustained growth. Its capital is a city whose most attractive and eye-catching features are its delicious fruits and the gastronomy that is offered there. It also has considerable commerce, since it has become a terrestrial \"port\" for commercial exchange between the mountain and coastal regions of the country. In addition, it has various tourist attractions, which, accompanied by its warm climate, are much visited by national and foreign tourists. It is for this reason that the majority of its inhabitants have undertaken some commercial activity or service for local residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nLeonel had relatives who had always worked in the wholesale distribution of rice to the stores, micro-markets, and warehouses both within and outside of the city. Leonel continued their example and has been working in this business for five years. He goes through the city and its outskirts offering his product and taking orders from his frequent customers. In the space in his rented house that he designated for his business, Leonel receives the product by the hundredweight and prepares it to go out through the city delivering it and also charging the customers. Leonel dreams of having his own house where he could build a warehouse for rice and some additional foodstuffs and thus be able to grow and give an example to other people. To achieve this dream, Leonel has proposed increasing his sales and creating some savings with the extra money that he receives. To do this, Leonel is applying for a loan that will be used 100% to place larger orders and to be able to meet the demands of his customers. \r\n\r\nLeonel thanks those who through Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa help him to finance his dreams and thus to be able to continue with the support of his children and some day see them become adults with excellent careers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1301483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"to buy greater quantities of rice and be able to save to have his own warehouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-02-25T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-27T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonel Benigno","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1439.48,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":219.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":234.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":239.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":243.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":248.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":253.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.3},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":221.5,"local_amount":219.89,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":221.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494990},{"amount":236.01,"local_amount":234.3,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":236.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524920},{"amount":241.3,"local_amount":239.55,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":241.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133224},{"amount":751.19,"local_amount":745.74,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":751.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313762}],"funded_date":"2013-03-09T17:17:05Z","paid_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":531792,"name":"Martin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Martin se dedica a la venta material de ferreter\u00eda como grifos para instalaciones de agua y variedad de productos, tiene su puesto de venta que se encuentra en la zona del Tejar   este pr\u00e9stamo es su primera secuencia dentro de la instituci\u00f3n, El Sr. Martin va a usar este pr\u00e9stamo para la compra material de ferreter\u00eda por mayor  para surtir su negocio y  de esta manera brindar variedad de productos  a sus clientes,  su raz\u00f3n para solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo es seguir mejorando en su  negocio, El Sr. Martin va a utilizar los beneficios para seguir comprando productos y as\u00ed ir mejorando sus ingresos, su deseo para su negocio es tener una ferreter\u00eda muy surtida.

He is married and has four children. He and his family live in the mountains. His wife is a housewife, and she raises the children. As they live in the mountains, they can only work with livestock breeding. \r\n\r\nHudoiberdi has been breeding livestock for many years already, and is very satisfied with this, because he gets a good income form this type of business. Every month he purchases livestock at the livestock market and fattens them for some time, before selling them at a higher price. \r\n\r\nSince childhood, Hudoiberdi's family had financial problems, and he was not able to study, and lived in bad conditions. Therefore, he dreams of his children living in prosperity, studying at the university, working with their profession of choice and not knowing hunger. In order to achieve all this he works very hard. \r\n\r\nHudoiberdi would like to purchase livestock and increase the number of cattle. For this he turned to the organization \"Arvand\" to receive a loan. He hopes that he gets the loan and can develop his business.

","en":"Mukim is a good and hardworking man. Because of family circumstances and tough times he was not able to get higher education. After school he started working and helped his parents, as he was the eldest son in the family. Mukim worked for food, but he did not forget about his moral values. He always read books and was very interested in medicine. \r\n\r\nThe years went by and currently Mukim has a family. He has a loving wife and three children. His wife does not work, she raises the children. Mukim, as a responsible family man, a caring father and a good husband, works hard so that his family is not in need and his children grow up literate. He works two shifts at the hospital as a medical assistant. He works and struggles so that his children don't have as hard a childhood as himself. He wants them to study and get an education. \r\n\r\nMukim tries to create good living conditions and always supports his family morally and materially. To realize his future plan, which is to renovate their apartment, he is in need of additional resources. He would like to refresh their living rooms and renew their bathroom by spring. To do this, he decided to take a loan and equip his house. He turned to \"MDO Arvand\" and hopes for help and support from the organization."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1297586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to purchase building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-25T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-27T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":304.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":315.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":326.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":337.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":349.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":361.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":374.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":387.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":400.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":414.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":429.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.68,"local_amount":304.37,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":307.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572670},{"amount":66.94,"local_amount":315.02,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":318.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971440},{"amount":69.29,"local_amount":326.05,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":329.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751954},{"amount":71.71,"local_amount":337.46,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":340.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616028},{"amount":74.22,"local_amount":349.27,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":352.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859899},{"amount":76.81,"local_amount":361.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":365.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136643},{"amount":79.51,"local_amount":374.15,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":378,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900838},{"amount":82.29,"local_amount":387.24,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":391.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550024},{"amount":85.17,"local_amount":400.8,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":404.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774252},{"amount":88.15,"local_amount":414.83,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":419.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673393},{"amount":91.23,"local_amount":429.31,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":433.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144198}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T22:27:41Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":531330,"name":"Narantuya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs.Narantuya is 38 years old and lives with her husband and son in a Ger in Bayanhongor province of Mongolia.

His primary income sources are eggs, tea, and crops.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Plucking tea!' His biggest challenge is: 'Plucking tea when too sunny.' The animal in the farm is named: 'Lelkina.\" He will use the loan of KES 20,000 from Juhudi Kilimo to buy more poultry birds.\r\n\r\nTonui was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Fast service.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: ''It deals with groups.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees.

termin\u00f3 la secundaria en su ciudad natal Quevedo y luego se traslad\u00f3 para prepararse en corte y confecci\u00f3n de ropa, es soltera y tiene un hijo quien se ha convertido en la motivaci\u00f3n para cada d\u00eda realizar su trabajo de la mejor forma. Pues ella sola es quien lleva el sustento a su casa y provee para las necesidades de su hijo y el mantenimiento y servicios b\u00e1sicos de la casa. Esta humilde mujer vive con su hijo en la parroquia Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n en Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Adem\u00e1s la visita de turistas nacionales y extranjeros aporta al fortalecimiento de las actividades de los emprendedores que desde hace algunos a\u00f1os han establecido sus negocios alrededor de toda la ciudad. Esta ciudad que es la tercera m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nDesde hace 25 a\u00f1os, Annie ejerci\u00f3 por cuenta propia su oficio de costura, confeccionando todo tipo de ropa casual y formal, oficio que hered\u00f3 de algunos familiares. Ella atiende a sus clientes en su casa, en donde ya muchos moradores de la zona la recomiendan por la responsabilidad y buen trabajo que realiza con la ropa. Trabaja todo el d\u00eda, sentada en su m\u00e1quina de coser elaborando trajes a la medida de sus clientes. Para Annie es importante un crecimiento de su negocio para que su hijo herede el esp\u00edritu emprendedor que seguramente le servir\u00e1 de mucho en el futuro. Como un paso al mejoramiento del negocio, ella requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual piensa comprar una m\u00e1quina de coser que servir\u00eda para la elaboraci\u00f3n de disfraces que son muy demandados en ciertas \u00e9pocas del a\u00f1o, adem\u00e1s de las telas e insumos necesarios. Con esta compra, los ingresos de Annie incrementar\u00e1n y ella podr\u00e1 mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su hijo para que \u00e9ste obtenga el t\u00edtulo profesional que ella no tuvo la oportunidad de conseguir. Cuando se le cont\u00f3 sobre la intermediaci\u00f3n de Kiva para financiar sus sue\u00f1os, Annie se sinti\u00f3 muy emocionada y dijo que agradece a cada persona que alrededor del mundo dedica tiempo y dinero a la realizaci\u00f3n de proyectos de emprendedores como ella que en muchas ocasiones se les dificulta tanto la obtenci\u00f3n de cr\u00e9ditos en el sector financiero. ","en":"Annie is a 56 year old woman.  Her life has been an example of hard work and effort.  She completed high school in her hometown of Quevedo and then moved in order to train herself in styling and sewing clothes.  She is unmarried and has one son who has become her motivation for doing her best job each day.  She alone is the one who supports her household, provides for her son\u2019s needs, and pays for the home\u2019s maintenance and utilities.  This humble woman lives with her son in the Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n parish in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas.  Commerce is very active here and this area has become a land port for trade between the mountains and the coast of Ecuador.  In addition, the visits of domestic and foreign tourists contribute to the strengthening of the activities of entrepreneurs that have established their businesses all around the city in recent years.  This city is the third most populous in the region and also contributes to activities such as agriculture, livestock breeding, fishing, and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nFor 25 years, Annie has been working as a self-employed seamstress. She inherited the trade from her family and makes all styles of casual and formal clothing.  She serves her clients in her home and many area residents recommend her because she is responsible and does a good job on the clothing.   She works all day, and sits at her sewing machine fashioning custom-made suits for her customers. For Annie, the growth of her business is important because she wants her son to inherit the entrepreneurial spirit that will surely serve him well in the future.  As a step toward improving her business, she is requesting a loan to purchase a sewing machine, fabric, and materials, which will help her make costumes that are in high demand at certain times of the year.  With this purchase, Annie\u2019s income will increase which will enable her to improve her quality of life and that of her son so that he may earn the professional degree that she didn\u2019t have the opportunity to obtain.

","en":"Tolibjon lives in the rural region of J. Rasulov District. He is 38 years old, married, and has three children. His wife works on a dekhan (mid-sized) farm. Tolibjon is a taxi driver. In his day, he was unfortunately unable to receive an education and now is forced to work as a taxi driver. \r\n\r\nTolibjon drives cars very well because he learned how to drive from an young age. He also fattens up cattle. During the day he tends to his cattle and at night, he has a side job as a taxi driver. Of course, Tolibjon is very exhausted, but he keeps his chin up and strives to do all he can so that his family can live comfortably. Currently, several malfunctions have developed with his car. \r\n\r\nTolibjon had savings for car repairs, but he had to pay for his daughter's education. In order to buy replacement parts for his car, he turned to Arvand for a loan. With the received loan, Tolibjon plans to buy essential replacement parts for his car and repair the malfunctions.

Rasulov. She is 48 years old, and has three children \u2014 two sons and one daughter. Sadly Markhabo's husband died several years ago, and she has been forced to become both mother and father to her children. Her sons have gone to Russia for work, and they try to send her as much money as possible. For several years, Markhabo has been working raising and fattening cattle. She buys young calves, fattens them, and then sells them for meat. Since she no longer bears the heavy responsibility of looking after the children, she has gotten a second job working the night shift in a home for the disabled. Her daughter helps her with raising the cattle. Things are very difficult for Markhabo without her husband, but she lives for the sake of her children and doesn't lose heart.

Winny owns the following: cow, poultry and motorcycle, but does not own pig, pump, bicycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

The three of them have many plans since it is quite difficult for such a young mother to get ahead with no help from the father of Leydi's daughter; however; she is a risk-taker and above all she knows that it is very important to prepare yourself for possibilities so she can offer more opportunities to her daughter and her family. \r\n\r\nShe has aspirations, among them that of being a very good student and being recognised in order to be able to position herself in the workforce so she can help not only her family but also her parents and society in general. She wants to finish her studies quickly and put her knowledge into practice. She says that this laon will allow her to achieve her dreams and goals more easily."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1301630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to start her first semester as a Nursing Assistant in CampoAlto","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T04:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T04:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leydi Tatiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.43,"local_amount":146000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-20T08:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":150544.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356828414},{"amount":83.43,"local_amount":146000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":150544.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197676},{"amount":73.14,"local_amount":128000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":131983.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372890998},{"amount":160,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":288714.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912415}],"funded_date":"2013-02-26T07:16:25Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Minogue","image":null}},{"id":531397,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is pictured here with one of her dairy cows, although she is requesting a loan to expand her poultry business.

In particular, she purchases cosmetics at wholesale prices and then resells them at a higher price to local people, making approximately 200 lari per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n<br>\r\nHayk requested a loan from Credo to re-start a family business. His loan request was approved through a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions for starting and re-starting businesses, targeting the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products due to being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the loan, Hayk will re-start a car wash, which was closed. He will purchase the new essential equipment and a vacuum cleaner. Hayk will continue providing services to his local community members and hopes to increase the monthly income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1301046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and the need to work to support himself, Jorge couldn't study the career of Agricultural Engineering, but he would have liked it so much.

On July 7, 1999 she started at Centro MYA, a foundation devoted since 1965 to the comprehensive care of people with cognitive disabilities who are referred as a protective measure by the Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (Colombian Institute for Family Welfare). She has a physical disability called \"hemiparesia\", which is a kind of brain paralysis or motor insufficiency with a central origin that affects mobility and muscular development in the left hand and foot. Despite this condition, she has been able to get along in many social contexts, as she can move independently, dance, sing, play and study. Together with her high-school diploma, she graduated as a systems technician at SENA. Centro MYA is her whole family and there she lives with 220 friends who also have some kind of disability.

He lives with his wife and children at his own place in Bougouni in the district of H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Centre. Due to the poverty of his parents, he decided to drop out of primary school in the 4th year (Malian education system) to benefit from revenue-generating work. Thus, for years, he ran several businesses unsuccessfully but finally decided to specialize in the buying and selling of construction lumber twenty years ago. He learned this business from one of his friends. \r\n\r\nWhile looking for additional financial resources, he decided to join the loan program at the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his first loan.\r\n\r\nHe plans on using this loan to purchase 90 boards of different dimensions (2, 3, 4, and 6 meters). He gets his supplies in Gueya (in the Republic of Cote d\u2019Ivoire). His lumber is sold in Bougouni and in Bamako. His customer base is composed of furniture makers, masons, and retailers. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 70,000 francs CFA.

She likes to watch soap operas in her spare time and sometimes cook a delicious  Carapulcra with dry soup to share with her family.\r\n\r\nWith great dedication, and thanks to her parents\u2019 encouragement, Isabel works her small flower business.  She has a small stall outside a cemetery in her town.  Isabel works about 10 hours every day, beginning in the morning and she believes that things are going well for her because of the good prices and good service she provides for her customers.\r\n\r\nIsabel is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she was able to buy flowers in quantity to supply her business.  In this way she was able to tend to her customers and provide better service.  Isabel will continue working and making an effort to achieve her greatest dream of having a great flower shop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1301696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy flowers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel Soledad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":127.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":128.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":135.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":139.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":146.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":151.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":157.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":164.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":171.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":178.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.43},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.84,"local_amount":127.11,"processed_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":131.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776470},{"amount":51.33,"local_amount":128.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":132.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483297},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":135.39,"processed_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":139.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889336},{"amount":55.73,"local_amount":139.34,"processed_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":144.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664238},{"amount":58.6,"local_amount":146.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:54Z","rounded_local_amount":151.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775506},{"amount":60.52,"local_amount":151.29,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":156.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778978},{"amount":63.04,"local_amount":157.6,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":162.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054171},{"amount":205.78,"local_amount":514.45,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":531.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819101}],"funded_date":"2013-02-27T19:17:48Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T12:52:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

With eight years of experience, he has mastered his business.\r\n\r\nTo obtain significant working capital, he decide to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to purchase 20 mobile phones, 15 batteries, and 18 covers. He is now on his first Soro Yiriwaso loan. He gets his supplies in Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) and makes his sales at the Bougouni market. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA.

She decided to start a fast-food business because her husband abandoned her leaving her alone with a small son.  This is why she strives daily at present to get ahead with her little boy.  She\u2019s single and her only help comes from God.

Biira is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fortportal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Biira has been working hard to manage her business, which deals in firewood. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Biira has requested a loan of 400000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to start another business, and also buy more firewood to sell. It will help Biira to generate greater profits and lead to increased returns so she can start another business. Biira hopes that in the future she will be able to buy land. \r\n\r\nBiira is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nTemel requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Temel will purchase a car and will work as a taxi driver.

Ana\u2019s coffee field is three kilometers from her house, and she travels to it each day on foot.\r\n\r\nAna is requesting a loan to buy fertilizer and manure and to pay for the labor for maintaining and harvesting her coffee crop. As a single mother, she says she is just not able to maintain it. With this loan, she says she will be able to harvest a good coffee crop, and with better results, she can invest the profits in the cultivation of the coffee field.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s dream is for her children to be educated so that they have better work opportunities and a better quality of life. They could then also support her and help her cover some household and personal necessities, as they are inheriting from all of her current effort and sacrifice for them to get ahead and have her coffee field."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1302264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and manure and to pay for the labor for maintaining and harvesting her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Griselda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5218.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082509},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5218.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895264}],"funded_date":"2013-02-27T15:12:43Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":531550,"name":"Lankeswari Mahila Samiti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lankeswari Mahila Samiti consists of 12 women from a village in Odisha.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan Vazha wants to open a Georgian bread bakery. He owns a commercial space and will buy all the needed equipment. Vazha will bake himself normal Georgian bread and also flavored sweet bread which originally comes from Khashuri district.  Vazha hopes the business will be profitable, as the location is very populous. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family and Vazha will be able to provide for his children\u2019s education in the future. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1301283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to open a Georgian bread bakery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Surami","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-02-26T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-28T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vazha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861442},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570252},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968884},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749302},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:14:57Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613208},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856934},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133594}],"funded_date":"2013-02-27T02:19:23Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:03:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn  Dalsing","image":null}},{"id":532273,"name":"Freddy Alonso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"FREDDY ALONSO tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad es soltero tiene una hija, vive con unos familiares en Chimbo Provincia de Bol\u00edvar.\n\nFREDDY ALONSO trabaja en una instituci\u00f3n P\u00fablica.

Nasygul's husband died suddenly in 2011. Since 1994, Nasygul has practiced animal husbandry and crop farming, starting this business with 3,000 som (KGS). On Nasygul's farm, she currently has one milk cow with offspring, 15 sheep, and 2.0 hectares of land planted with beans and sainfoin.The monthly profit is about 9,000 som (KGS). The income allows Nasygul to cover her family's daily expenses for food and living needs. In order to further develop her business, Nasygul turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of 8 sheep, which would increase her income through the resale of livestock. With this income, Nasygul plans to save money for her children's weddings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1301800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 8 sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Dobo village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-02-27T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-29T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":20245.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777035},{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":30368.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426825},{"amount":204.31,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10122.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.19,"payment_id":459019355}],"funded_date":"2013-02-27T16:15:00Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T09:16:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":532285,"name":"Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teresa es una mujer emprendedora y luchadora con muchos deseos de superaci\u00f3n feliz mente casada madre de un hijo junto a su esposo se dedican a la actividad de cultivo y producci\u00f3n de granos b\u00e1sicos como ser ma\u00edz, frijoles y caf\u00e9 en peque\u00f1a escala producto que es comercializado en los alrededores y cercan\u00edas de su pueblo, mercado local  y de su vivienda.

Her husband sadly died four years ago, victim of a violent murder outside of their neighborhood. When she was younger, her parents had a very low income and could not support her in her studies, so she decided to learn how to work the land from a very young age. She married when she was 19 and was happily married for eight years. Her in-laws very kindly gave her and their grandchildren a plot of land to grow coffee so that she could provide for herself and her children in terms of clothing, food and medicines, etc. First of all she is thankful to God, her parents, and her in-laws who help her with her children\u2019s expenses while the harvest is ending. She uses part of her earnings to invest in her crops, and spends the other part on her family as her children are growing up and the expenses are increasing. Her crops are six kilometers from where she lives, and she travels to them on foot. \r\n\r\nIrma want to improve her situation and has the support of her parents and in-laws. She is currently requesting a loan to buy fertilizer, manure, and water pumps to fertilize her coffee crops in order to have a good harvest this year.\r\n\r\nHer goals, hopes, and dreams are to be able to give her children a good education so that they have a better quality of life, better job opportunities,and can support her in what she knows best how to do, which is agriculture, although it is very tiring work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1302281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer, manure and water pumps to improve her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-02-27T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-29T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":14500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":737.86,"local_amount":14507,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":14668.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895265},{"amount":10.17,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":202.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542499070},{"amount":117.19,"local_amount":2304,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2329.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562417597},{"amount":609.78,"local_amount":11989,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":12122.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624826973}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T04:09:44Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T09:59:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geraldine Pugh","image":null}},{"id":531544,"name":"Mabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mabel lives in Sinkor, one of the areas where the living conditions are almost like those in the center of Monrovia.

She is 19 years old. She is a dynamic, hard-working, and entrepreneurial young woman with a great desire to advance and better herself every day. Her parents gave her support so that she could study and graduate as a certified public accountant. Unfortunately, she was not able to practice her profession as such since she made the decision to marry at an early age, and as a homemaker, other needs arose, including a daughter. Along with her husband, they decided to look for better opportunities to advance, and they saw the need in their town to set up a business that does not have much competition, a confectionery. She has a great desire to have another activity beyond being a homemaker. Her husband is a graduate from the same course in public accounting, and he now works in FUDEINFA, a technical branch of the COMIXMUL cooperative, as an evaluator of projects, where the income that he earns brings the necessities to their home. Together they saw the need that one of the two had to see a way of generating a little more income, and so the opportunity was presented to Glevis to take a course in confectionery given by the FUDEINFA institution, and thanks to the cooperative, she learned to manage in a different way.\r\n\r\nGlevis is now applying for assistance to buy a display case, pots, casseroles, spatulas, and a mixer in order to give better service to her customers, who are neighbors, family friends, and others who have helped her products to become popular. \r\n\r\nGlevis is a young woman with many
