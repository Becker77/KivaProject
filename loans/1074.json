She has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is small monthly salaries earned by Mzia\u2019s husband and her eldest son, who works locally as a shepherd. Besides this, they own two donkeys and transport wood from the forest to sell among their villagers. The income is hardly enough for food for a seven-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the Subsistence Poor category. \r\n\r\nMzia requested a loan from Credo to start up the family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program aims to provide business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions, to the country\u2019s rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the credit she received, Mzia will purchase stocks of basic groceries for starting up a small grocery store. She will sell the products with a price mark-up and this will increase the family income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the large family.

Ahora viven en uni\u00f3n libre con su pareja Ram\u00f3n de 57 a\u00f1os que lleva el sustento a su hogar gracias a su labor de agricultor y con quien tiene 6 hijos a quienes educaron y sostuvieron hasta que salieron de casa para ser independientes y trabajar por s\u00ed solos. En la actualidad Angela vive con su esposo en la Parroquia R\u00edo Verde del Cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo  en Ecuador. Todos en la zona la conocen como una mujer emprendedora y esforzada que lucha cada d\u00eda por sus sue\u00f1os. \nAngela ayudaba a su esposo en la agricultura, pero la necesidad en su hogar fue creciendo y decidi\u00f3 emprender hace 16 a\u00f1os en el comercio de juegos de ollas y ropa casual. Ella aprendi\u00f3 la actividad del comercio en su tierra natal que es Calceta y es una ciudad peque\u00f1a que se caracteriza por ser bastante comercial. De hecho el obst\u00e1culo m\u00e1s grande que ella ha tenido es rehacer su vida en una nueva ciudad que ella no conoc\u00eda pero en la cual fue muy bien recibida. Ahora ella solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para adquirir mercader\u00eda y realizar algunas adecuaciones a su casa esquinera en donde atiende para que llame la atenci\u00f3n y las personas que le buscan recomendadas por sus clientes puedan localizarla m\u00e1s f\u00e1cilmente.

She has learned to survive despite the lack of work caused by her lack of education. Due to various circumstances, she was only able to finish primary school. Now she lives in a common law marriage with her spouse, Ram\u00f3n, who is 57. He supports the home with his work as a farmer and she has 6 children with him, whom they raised and supported until they left home to be on their own and work for themselves. Right now, Angela lives with her husband in the parish of R\u00edo Verde in the Santo Domingo canton of Ecuador. Everyone in the area knows her as an enterprising and hardworking woman who fights for her dreams every day. \r\n \r\nAngela helped her husband with the farming, but the need in the home grew and 16 years ago she decided to start selling sets of pots and casual clothes.  She learned about sales in her native home of Calceta. It is a small town characterized as being very commercial. In fact, the biggest obstacle she has had is starting her life over again in a new city that she wasn't familiar with, where she was very well received. Now she is asking for a loan to acquire merchandise and improve her corner house where she has her locale so it will get people's attention and the people who seek her out on her customers' recommendation can find her more easily. Angela is taking out her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa thanks to the recommendation of her daughter, who told her about the trust and support that this entity gives entrepreneurs in vulnerable areas. Angela hopes that with this loan, her sales will increase and she can see her business become an excellent commercial business that gives her what she needs to have a nice old age at her husband's side.

They own a large piece of land and farm different types of vegetables over the course of the year. They sell their harvest in the market and earn a good income that helps them cover some of their needs and live in better conditions.\r\nMona is requesting a 2,500 USD loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing seasonal seedlings.\r\nThis will allow them to produce a better crop and thus increase their sales and improve the family's income.

The rural village, founded in 1880, is home to a people who are friendly and happy, despite the area\u2019s typically cold weather.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Patachaj Trust Bank was founded by seven local women. With the addition of six new members this year, the group has grown to 13 enthusiastic women, excitedly awaiting their loans from Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nTeresa is one of the new members. She is 31 years old and married to a day laborer named Alejandro. The couple has three children, two girls and one boy, who attend the local elementary school. Teresa and her husband, who were themselves unable to attend school beyond the second grade, are dedicated to keeping their children in school.\r\n \r\nA year ago, when Teresa noticed that her husband's income was not enough to support their family, she started a small business selling tortillas.  Currently using a wood stove, she is restricted to selling the tortillas on the road outside her home three days a week. She joined Patachaj Trust Bank so she could buy a gas stove. A gas stove, which is more economical and easier to transport, would allow her to locate her business in San Cristobal Totonicapan\u2019s busy market center, ten minutes from her home. Her goal is to work at least four days a week in her business.  \r\n\r\nBesides Teresa\u2019s tortilla business, the women in Patachaj Trust Bank hand-embroider blouses, manufacture clothing, and own small convenience stores, among other enterprises. The loans and monthly training they receive from their involvement in Friendship Bridge\u2019s microcredit program expand their businesses and keep their children in school. They all expressed their gratitude to KIVA investors for helping to develop them and their families.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4450,"image":{"id":1300260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The Trust Bank, whose name means \u201ccherry\u2019s heart\u201d is located in the western highlands of Guatemala in rural Patachaj, San Cristobal Totonicapan. Currently the group has ten members, half of whom are starting their third loan cycle. The other half are new members. The women's businesses include animal husbandry, weaving, embroidery and garment-making.\r\n\r\nOne of the women, Ana, is 32 years old and has one son. She makes skirts and embroidered blouses, typical of Guatemala, which she sells wholesale.  She started her business five years ago, and joined the Chucuxcabel Trust Bank when it started in 2011, so that she could hire employees to help expand her business. Proudly, today she provides jobs to six women, all of whom are better able to support their large families because of their employment with Ana. In her third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge, Ana plans to buy yarn and fabric in preparation for the annual Easter holiday. This year she hopes her team will be able to start work early in order to meet the customer demand.\r\n\r\nAna and the other members of Chucuxcabel have paid back their previous loans and are requesting a new one. By allowing them to grow their businesses, the loans have a great impact on their lives and those of their families. Ana, in particular, has benefited from Friendship Bridge\u2019s microcredit program which, in addition to the loans, provides monthly training sessions to discuss issues like women\u2019s health, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, and business management. \r\n\r\nThe Chucuxcabel Trust Bank appreciates the help from KIVA investors as it encourages them to continue investing in

A Vision Fund loan will help buy vaccines, antiparasitics, and food for their sheep.\r\n\r\nShe and her group are grateful for the support for their businesses have gotten from these loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":1302516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for vaccines, antiparasitics, and food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Cerro Mojarra la Capilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-02-27T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-29T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7200},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7200},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7200},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7200},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":287.52,"local_amount":3664,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596102},{"amount":522.62,"local_amount":6660,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6713.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663530},{"amount":2014.86,"local_amount":25676,"processed_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":25880.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698434}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T17:19:06Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T14:20:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":531976,"name":"Cindy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cindy is 21 years old and newly married.

Miguel is married to Heliodora and they have two children.  One is taking preparatory courses for university while the younger is at secondary school.  Miguel says that he has had his fruit and vegetable business for 22 years as, when he married, his mother helped him to set up his own stall, so that he could look after his family.  Miguel buys his seasonal fruit and vegetables in the town's central market.  He has to go very early in order pick the best and freshest fruit, so that it is not bruised, and so he can sell it for a better price.  He goes out to sell his fruit in different markets in the state and he says he likes his a lot as he has afternoon free to look after his children and family.  He says he is applying for a loan with Vision Fund because he wants to stock up his stall as the high season for selling is coming.  Easter week is when fruits such as oranges, mandarins, watermelon, melons and pineapple sell best.  He also grows avocados, which are ready in both February and June.

She belongs to a group called El Capulin (The Cherry Tree) because where they meet there is a big leafy tree and they decided to name themselves that to better locate the group. More than 40 years ago her mother taught her the art of knitting wool to create clothing like zarape shawls, blankets, hats, scarves, coats, and other shawls of this pretty and very warm material, as sheep are raised easily in her area and from them they get the raw material to make their woolen creations. Mrs. Regina also makes napkins, tablecloths and cushions, and sells them in the areas surrounding her community. \r\n\r\nSometimes she is invited to expo fairs in areas where regional artisan work is exhibited. She is currently asking for a loan to buy material. She says in words that are half cut off, as she doesn't know how to speak Spanish very well, \u201cI need a loan to buy material, the Zitacuaro expo fair will be happening soon and I barely have anything to sell.

Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Aigun will purchase sheep. After purchasing the sheep, she will be able to expand her livestock and increase the income of the family.

He is married and is the father of three children. Rahmonberdi and his family live in a remote, mountainous region. His wife is a homemaker and takes care of their children. For over 15 years, Rahmonberdi has been fattening up cattle and knows all about the advantages of this business. In the region where he lives, this type of business is very important. Rahmonberdi buys young calves at the livestock market and, after fattening them for a little while, sells them for a favorable price. This business is the family's only source of income and he strives to expand it. Rahmonberdi has wanted to buy a car for a long time; he has dreamed about it his whole life. He has savings, but not enough for a car. Now he plans to increase his number of cattle and with the acquired profit, buy a car. \r\n\r\nWith the received loan, Rahmonberdi plans to buy cattle. He really hopes that this year will be a lucky one and that he will be able to fulfill his longtime dream.

For the past two years, Margaret has been working hard to manage her business, which sells firewood. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Margaret has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more charcoal to sell, and will help Margaret generate greater profits. Margaret hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own. \r\n\r\nMargaret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She likes selling and relating to people.  She works alone starting at 10 in the morning and ending at 8 at night.  Her business is seasonal goods sales.   Her challenges are the illness she has which sometimes keeps her from being able to work; the illness she has is PVVS (patient living with HIV) and crime.  She\u2019s single and has a ten-year-old daughter attending public school.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy shirts and squirt guns for carnival since the beach season has begun.  Her dream is that her health improves and that God gives her the opportunity to continue living and sharing with her daughter.

He works very hard and is completing his studies with great effort and dedication.  Recently, he is employed at an airport. He works around 12 hours a day with a low salary.

She also has a loading station and a food stall for additional income.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and to pay for maintenance on their tricycle unit. She will also use the money to buy frozen foods and ingredients for her food stall. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nErlinda hopes to have her own house for her family and dreams of having a harmonious relationship with her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The two oldest are in school.  She is from Le\u00f3n, in the northern part of the country.  In her free time, Rosa enjoys spending time with her children and preparing regional food such as \"sopa de leche, cajetas\" (caramel).  Rosa is known as a hard-working, responsible person who always has helped cover household expenses since she was very young.  Unfortunately, she was unable to get a degree due to lack of resources, but she would have liked to become a social worker.\r\n\r\nThanks to her determination to get ahead, she runs a business selling hand-made mattresses in different bed sizes: double, twin or crib.  In the photo we see a twin size mattress.  She has been in business for four years, working both as a street vendor and from home.

Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a hectare of agricultural land, where haricot nut trees and cherry trees are grown. Besides thhis, her husband works as an artisan and gets a monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIamze requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Iamze will purchase a milk cow. After purchasing a milk cow, she plans to produce dairy products and increase the income of the family. A small part of the loan will be used to cultivate the land for sowing seeds.

responsible and punctual 35-year old man. He is married and has three children. Bahodir busy and resells cattle. He has started this business 10 years ago. He values his work as it allows him to support himself. At the beginning, Bahodir had only two sheep; after fattening the animals, he sold them at a good price and was very glad to do so. In this way, he kept increasing his sales volume. At present Bahodir already knows how to manage the business to his advantage. \r\n\r\nAfter increasing his revenues, Bahodir has been able to buy a store in the middle of his village. His wife sells food products in this store. This is an additional source of income for them. But their main income is from raising livestock. This is why Bahodri has applied to Arvand for a loan in order to buy more livestock and develop his animal-raising business. He appreciates the existence of organizations such as Arvand, which allow people in need of financial support to fulfill their plans.
