And so, she has been able to repopulate the cochineal population on her cactus fruit and is able to sell them for a good price. She will continue to work and strive to do her best in order to achieve her dream of giving her children a good education and a profession. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1303414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"cover the costs of her crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-02-28T18:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-30T18:40:01Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela Maritza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3039.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779490}],"funded_date":"2013-03-01T00:57:11Z","paid_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristin Connor","image":1393863}},{"id":532964,"name":"Jamolidin","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0416\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0443 46 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439. \u0421\u0430\u043c \u0416\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0416\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u0431\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e. \u041e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e-\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u0416\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442, \u0438 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441.

Together with his wife Darlina, he is bringing up two children aged three and four. Darlina has been indispensible to running their 1.5 acre cacao farm, and has been helping with activities like cleaning and harvesting. Besides help with maintaining the farm and taking care of the family, she also does local Maya crafts like woven goods from jippi jappa palm. \n\nCacao, the only cash crop in many of the local Mayan communities throughout Belize\u2019s southernmost district of Toledo, is also the sole source of income for the family at the moment. For Roberto, harvesting is his favorite part of cacao farming because it is also the most rewarding, as compensation is immediate. Farmers have the option to either sell their cacao fresh or fermented and dried, providing leeway to develop expertise in processing or to instead focus more on the farming itself. Fresh cacao are the seeds of cacao fruit covered with a sweet pulp that begins fermenting shortly after the fruit is cracked open. The most challenging thing about cacao for this young farmer has been trying to keep the monilia fungal disease from spreading in his farm. \n\nIn the future, Roberto wants to expand the family farm, build a comfortable home and save money to invest in the education of the children. An entrepreneur in spirit, Roberto is looking at business opportunities to create alternative sources of income for the family as well. The couple is requesting this loan to expand their cacao farm by 1,000 new trees, more than doubling the current number. To prepare for the expansion, they will hire five men for seven days to clean the area to be planted, and bag cacao seeds. The first step in planting new cacao is raising a seedling in a bag filled with topsoil to make it ready for transplantation into the ground. Once a seedling has four or more leaves, it is ready for planting, and can be expected to become productive in three to five years after. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1303398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand cacao farm by 1000 trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-28T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-30T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":47.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971176},{"amount":44.73,"local_amount":89.46,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":90.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751701},{"amount":17.22,"local_amount":34.44,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":34.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993442},{"amount":38.9,"local_amount":77.81,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":78.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255611},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":69.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136451},{"amount":0.27,"local_amount":0.54,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":0.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900668},{"amount":90.76,"local_amount":181.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":183.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088549}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T19:35:29Z","paid_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":532872,"name":"Evaristo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evaristo, 48, and his wife Pantiola live in the village of San Antonio, in Belize\u2019s southernmost district of Toledo. They are raising nine children, aged four to 19, three of whom are currently in school and seven live at home. Pantiola is busy taking care of the large family, but also oversees fermentation and drying of cacao. Fermentation stops cacao beans from further ripening and softens their bitter flavor, and drying makes the beans crunchy and further develops their flavor. \n\nWith the help of his children, Evaristo maintains a large cacao farm with around productive 4,500 trees, planted about nine years ago. He initially started to plant encouraged by the arrival of Hershey\u2019s Chocolate in Belize in the early 90\u2019s, but his farm was damaged in the aftermath of the Hurricane Iris in 2001. Evaristo replanted his trees the next season and reached full production again a few years back. A cacao tree typically takes three to five years from the time it is transplanted in the ground to become productive, and continues bearing fruit for decades thereafter. A tree\u2019s productivity is affected by a myriad of factors including tree maintenance, amount of shade, and soil health. \n\nEvaristo is happy with the state of his farm, especially because he\u2019s been able to keep diseases like the fungal infection monilia in check and not affecting his cacao production. While he enjoys all aspects of cacao farming, Ewaristo says cleaning is by far the most challenging, because a large farm like his takes approximately 80 days to clean on his own. Cleaning is the process of chopping underbrush to keep the farm tidy, with healthy airflow and access to the trees for pruning and harvesting. Farmers in the lush tropical lowlands of Belize have to repeat cleaning around three times a year. In the future, Evaristo hopes to have a model cacao farm and to start growing other fruit trees and fresh vegetables. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to hire help to clean around the 4,500 cacao trees, a job that will require five men to work about 25 days on the farm. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1303399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To clean around 4,500 cacao trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Antonio","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-02-28T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-30T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evaristo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":47.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971177},{"amount":47.85,"local_amount":95.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751702},{"amount":24.11,"local_amount":48.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":48.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993443},{"amount":24.23,"local_amount":48.46,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":48.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255612},{"amount":130.06,"local_amount":260.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":262.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136452}],"funded_date":"2013-02-28T23:27:12Z","paid_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":533240,"name":"Pricila Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pricila del Carmen es una joven mujer de treinta y cuatro a\u00f1os de edad madre de dos ni\u00f1os de 2 y 14 a\u00f1os de edad, el mayor cursa segundo a\u00f1o de la secundaria. tiene por actividad econ\u00f3mica la elaboraci\u00f3n de tortillas desde hace 4 anos que se dedica a dicha actividad.

After she got married, her financial problems started. She gave birth to three children and raised them. Her husband was not able to keep a stable job and Nodira did not work. \r\n\r\nThis year, her husband went to the Russian Federation and found appropriate work. The children also grew up and Nodira can do her work. She plans to set up a new business of buying and reselling livestock, as she has a large garden and is able to grow fodder for the livestock herself.

","en":"Mamur is a man of the age of 63. He is married and has three children. His wife is a housewife. Mamur works with growing apricots. In the summer he collects apricots and dries them, and in the winter he sells these dry apricots at the market. \r\n\r\nMamur built a new house not long ago, and he would like to install a stove for winter heating. This winter was very hard for them as their old stove was out of order and could not be repaired. It was very cold. Not long ago, Mamur was told by his acquaintances that \"Arvand\" issues energy-saving stoves on credit through the product \"green credit\". He was very happy that he got such an opportunity to purchase such a stove, with which it is possible to both heat the house, prepare food and bake cakes. His wife was also very happy after she discovered this. \r\n\r\nThey decided to purchase this stove and turned to the organization \"Arvand\". Mamur hopes for support from \"Arvand\" and the realization of his

Sobir plans to use the loan received to purchase building materials and build a big house for his only son. \n\nDespite his young age, Sobir has already planted a few trees, he is raising a son and of course, like a real man, is building a house.

In the mornings, Paulino works as a taxi driver, \"On harvesting days, I stop working in transportation and I take my vehicle to the farm,\" he affirms. \r\n\r\nSince his principal source of income is farming, Paulino has his own plots of land located a few hours away from his house. For this reason, he leaves very early in the morning to work. He has 20 years of experience since he learned this trade when he was a young boy. \"I farmed and had my own animals, but I moved to the city so that my children could study.

She keeps four cows and 80 sheep. Almast has been involved in agriculture for more than fifteen years, and it has become a part of her life. She breeds cattle to get milk which she uses in cheese production. Due to her hard work, her cheese is in strong demand among the buyers. Almast works hard to meet her clients' demand and sustain her family. As agriculture helps Almast to get income and cover her family's daily costs she would like to expand the business.

She is 38 years old and married with four children, aged 4 to 22.  All four of her children currently attend school. Margaret operates a business six days per week selling palm oil, gari and wood from her house. She started her business to improve herself and educate her children.  She says that getting a vehicle to take her while she is carrying her inventory is difficult and is a challenge she faces in the business.  She requested this loan to purchase more palm oil, wood and gari for her business.  In five years, she hopes to be able to own her own shop. She wants to use the profits from her business to educate her children and provide for her family.

He lives with his wife and children, whom he loves a lot.  Despite the adversities he has faced in life, he continues to be closer than ever to his family.  Because of his scarce economic resources Marco only managed to study  up to the fifth year of secondary school, but he would like to have studied the field of human medicine.\r\n\r\nEvery day Marco strives to get his family ahead, which he does with his small and modest car-washing business.  He works about 10 hours a day and can serve up to 10 customers.  He believes he's getting ahead in his business because he's friendly with the customers and because his family is the driving force and best motivation for striving.\r\n\r\nMarco is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help he'll be able to buy a new tricycle to carry the pails of water he uses to wash the cars.

","en":"Edwin, age 30, is a hard-working and very cheerful man. He lives in the company of his wife, Sarita, with whom he has 2 children, Judith and Guillermo. Together with them, he has lived in the home of his aunt for 4 years. Since he was 18, he worked tirelessly in agriculture, since he always took care of his parents. When he started his own family, he thought about obtaining a steady income and being able to live in the city, and for that reason he bought his moto-taxi. Since then, he has been working without rest every day, since he wants to have a house of his own. During these years, it has gone so well for him that he bought another moto-cart, and he taught his wife to drive it, so that they could work together to transport people around the city. Now he works much more, since he has to provide constant maintenance for both moto-taxis. He hopes that he will be able to continue saving and to buy more moto-taxis.

Two of her children are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nFatmata has a business selling refrigerator parts, copper rods, pans, and wood, as well as water and drinks. She works 11 hours per day, 6 days per week at her business. She started this business because she was alone and had to take care of her family. \r\n\r\nFatmata requested this loan to purchase more inventory to expand the water-and-drinks side of her business. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that in five years time, she sees her child be the first in the family to go to university. She thanks you for your support.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1302458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

When she was ten years old, her mother taught her how to weave with mezcal.* She began weaving hammocks and matatas (canvas bags) from maguey* and pita*. Eventually, she began making hammocks with silk thread and poly silk.  Now, she is teaching her children how to weave hammocks.  Her husband works in farming in the morning and weaves hammocks in the evening.\r\n\r\nShe buys the supplies for making the hammocks in a city that is ten minutes away.  Sometimes she travels by car and other times she walks because there is no public transportation.  She travels every fifteen to twenty days, accompanied by her husband or one of her children.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to purchase sand and cement to finish building a retaining wall for her home as the previous one was washed away in winter.  She will also buy fifty pounds of yarn and she will invest the remainder in supplies to remove water from a well that she is building.  Her home doesn\u2019t have potable water and she is currently buying it form private individuals.  In this way, she will have the supplies to continue making hammocks and satisfying customer demand.  In addition, she will have a safer home for her family.

She earns a minimum of PHP 2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business.

She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, for which they are paid a boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nLourdes hopes to have more capital for her growing business and dreams of having a good and peaceful life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She has completely paid back her entire loan and it has empowered her to upgrade her lifestyle and be in better shape. Now, she has formed a group of five members including her. The total requested loan amount is 5,300,000 KHR. Rum whose loan portion is 500,000 KHR will use her loan to pay for labor fees, seed and insecticide. She hopes that this purchase will help her to grow her crops on time and return her double profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1283360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To pay for labor fees, seed and insecticide ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Moung Russey district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-31T08:00:06Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noeurn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doeurng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":5300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1197.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":433.02,"local_amount":1700000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1724862.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364842008},{"amount":229.25,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":913162.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373047274},{"amount":152.83,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":608774.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390696500},{"amount":152.83,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":608774.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942677},{"amount":254.72,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1014624.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420332770},{"amount":127.35,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":507312.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440092003}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T00:19:23Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T11:08:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":521205,"name":"Aminas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 45-year-old married woman named Aminas lives in the Sampov Meas District in Cambodia\u2019s Pursat Province.

He had enjoyed stable finances, but due to his daughter's health problems (an illness inherited from her ancestors: third level epilepsy), don Cirilo has had to bring her to specialized hospital centers that can treat his daughter and reduce the frequency of her epileptic attacks.  Because of the scarce rainfall during the previous agricultural cycle, the subterranean water level in the area has been reduced.   As such, don Cirilo has lost a great quantity of his tomato plants.  The community has restricted water usage to a minimum, which hasn't been sufficient for his crops.  This has caused don Cirilo a loss of income, being unable to selling his products.  For these reasons, his financial stability has suffered an imbalance which has directly affected his ability to acquire the materials and supplies he needs for production, like being unable to buy food for the laborers that he employs.  In order to remedy all of the above, don Cirilo is turning to a loan request.  His goal is to improve his quality of life and to return to the path of prosperity.  He wants to buy oxen to help with the plowing.  He also mentions year after year water quantities have diminished as a result of climate change (global warming).
