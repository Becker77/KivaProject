Years ago, she built a small chicken coop that fits 200 chickens per season.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she is taking out this loan so her husband can use it in his work.  He has crops of rice, corn, and peanuts and at this time needs money to buy fertilizer and insecticide in order to have a better harvest this winter.  She for her part doesn't have many chickens during this time because during this time of year she loses chickens.  For this reason, she doesn't take the risk.  When the chickens are large she delivers them to local traders and stores.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy fertilizer and manure in order to have a very good harvest.  She has been with this community bank since it's opening and is glad for the help that it always gives her with loans.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that her children complete their

This is her first year as a member of the Las Acasias group, though she was a part of another community group previously, but changed groups to be a part of one closer to her home.\r\n\r\nHer goals include continuing her participation in the community bank, and taking advantage of the benefits and support structure there.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6625,"image":{"id":1290384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, fish and other food items for her restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Junin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-03-01T08:07:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-31T08:07:26Z","loan_amount":6625,"lender_count":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Edita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tarcila Marielena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tany Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obdulia Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Placida Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pura Misaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carla Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea Stefania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irina Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesica Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6615.59,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":6625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":661.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":661.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":661.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":661.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":661.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":661.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":661.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":661.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":661.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":661.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1987.5,"local_amount":1984.68,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1987.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355816027},{"amount":1325.01,"local_amount":1323.12,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1325.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364526137},{"amount":1987.5,"local_amount":1984.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1987.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372926906},{"amount":1324.99,"local_amount":1323.11,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1324.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381703965}],"funded_date":"2013-03-11T11:04:27Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:14:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":525181,"name":"6 De Diciembre  (Montecristi) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal 6 Diciembre se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

She is in a common-law marriage, from which she has two children who are 13 and 11 and who are studying in school. Her husband is a farmer. Danny, in order to help her husband with the household expenses, sells all kinds of clothing via door-to-door sales. She works all over the city, three days per week, usually in the mornings, since that\u2019s when her children are in school. She also goes with her husband to help him with his labors in the fields, especially during winter, which is when he does most of his planting. \r\n\r\nShe sells to her clients on credit and then charges them every 8 days. She has been in this business for three years, and thanks to her earnings, they have gotten ahead; the farming activities alone often don\u2019t result in much income. She will use this loan to buy more merchandise, such as pants, blouses, t-shirts, and clothing for the beach, which is what is selling best at the moment. This is her first loan cycle in the communal bank and she likes it because of the terms for obtaining loans.\r\n\r\nHer dream is for her children to finish their studies so they can be sucessful professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6500,"image":{"id":1290389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy pants, blouses, t-shirts, and clothing for the beach.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-03-01T08:07:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-31T08:07:26Z","loan_amount":6500,"lender_count":149,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gissell Johana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tatiana Cumanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamil Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kathy Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Moncerrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Danny Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6493.54,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":811.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":811.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":811.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":811.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":811.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":811.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":811.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":811.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2437.49,"local_amount":2435.07,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2437.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355816028},{"amount":1625,"local_amount":1623.38,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364526138},{"amount":2437.51,"local_amount":2435.09,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2437.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372926907}],"funded_date":"2013-03-05T22:04:42Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:22:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":525281,"name":"Erdenechimeg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erdenechimeg, 49 years old, lives with her two sons, daughter-in-law, and mother in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

She started in commerce 22 years ago, because she saw that there were no stores near where she was living. Thus she got the idea to open her own business, which she saw was going to generate a better income since there was no competition. This has been her first business and she relies on the support of her husband. She sells her products from her home and depends on other income, such as the money that her husband gives her. \n\nNowadays Eddi wants to invest in her store in order to be able to offer her customers a more varied inventory and obtain more income. The new school season is approaching and this is the reason that Eddi is requesting the funding to purchase school supplies, such as notebooks, pencils, rulers, erasers, colored pencils, etc. These are all necessary supplies that she still does not have. She estimates that this loan will be a help because she will be able to stock her business to attract more customers. In this way she will increase her sales and generate more earnings. One of her next goals is to pay off this loan so that she will then be able to return to request another one.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1293974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase notebooks, pencils, rulers, erasers, colored pencils, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-03-01T08:10:52Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-31T08:10:52Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eddi Elena \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531381},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573327},{"amount":56.13,"local_amount":56.13,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":56.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373166012},{"amount":59.32,"local_amount":59.32,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":59.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971824},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837198},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":55.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":55.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860489},{"amount":52.25,"local_amount":52.25,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349196},{"amount":57.25,"local_amount":57.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":57.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901353},{"amount":52.81,"local_amount":52.81,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550512}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T20:42:01Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:14:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":527387,"name":"Qori Chaska De Qollana Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cQORI CHASKA DE QOLLANA\u201d;

Now, she is in need of working capital in order to timely support her cash-crops. Therefore, she formed a group of three to apply for a new loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). This is Neng's sixth time borrowing from VisionFund. Her past loans have been repaid back with success and have improved her standard of living in a gradual manner. This cycle, she and her fellow group members are requesting 2,000,000 KHR each. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy potash and to pay for plowing fees for both cash-crops. She hopes to grow her paddy and generate more income so that she can build a bigger house for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1294289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy potash and to pay for plowing fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-03-01T08:11:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-31T08:11:24Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":6000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":292.29,"local_amount":1150000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1164196.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429641919},{"amount":152.5,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":607407.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479282831},{"amount":114.37,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":455555.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504420528},{"amount":965.84,"local_amount":3800000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3846911.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517698153}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T15:09:26Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T18:14:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jonathan Hiebert","image":852394}},{"id":527548,"name":"Tha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A hardworking local farmer from Thbaung Khmum district of Kampong Cham province, Tha is an 53-year-old widow mother with six children.

Currently, she is in need of working capital to support her crops, and so she formed a group of two to apply for a new loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and the need to work in order to cover costs, Gisella was not able to study, even though she would very much have liked to.  In her spare time, Gisella likes to watch films and, on occasion, she prepares a delicious \"aj\u00ed de gallina\" (a traditional Peruvian, chicken-based dish) to share with her family.\r\n\r\nThrough her own initiative, and with a lot of determination and dedication, Gisella has a small business selling groceries.  She work every day from early in the morning, for around eight hours.  She likes her work and thinks that it is going well because of her good prices and the friendly service she gives to customers.\r\n\r\nGisella is very grateful to Kiva lenders as, thanks to the support provided, she will be able to improve her home.

She is motivated to provide them with good food, health and education. \r\n\r\nTo cope with the increasing demand of her customers, she contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of 20,000 PKR. She intends to use this loan amount to buy raw materials including cloth, threads of different colors, laces and zippers to create a means of increasing revenues so she may be able to generate a stronger source of income. She is currently in her 2nd loan cycle with a good repayment history. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1294921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials including cloth, threads of different colors, laces and zippers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Gujrat","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-03-01T08:13:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-31T08:13:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shabana  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1415},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1457},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1499},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1588},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1635},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1683},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1732},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1834},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1888},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1944}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.31,"local_amount":2872,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3170.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355848652},{"amount":34.22,"local_amount":3042,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3357.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372955690},{"amount":36.26,"local_amount":3223,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3557.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390822569},{"amount":18.93,"local_amount":1683,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1857.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399844483},{"amount":19.49,"local_amount":1732,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1911.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410117718},{"amount":20.05,"local_amount":1782,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1967,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419882959},{"amount":41.87,"local_amount":3722,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4108.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439755393},{"amount":21.87,"local_amount":1944,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2145.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449659878}],"funded_date":"2013-03-01T16:31:20Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T11:49:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":528207,"name":"Salimata","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Salimata  est une r\u00e9sidente du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

","en":"\"Santa Rosa de Lima\" communal bank is a group full of energy that comprises eight members. They are in their fifth cycle of loans with the field partner. Jaqueline, one of the members, was elected treasurer by the others. She is 39, married, and has two children, who are still in her care. Seeing that her spouse's income, earned as a mason, was not enough to cover household expenses, she decided to start her own business, a grocery shop, where she sells basic products. She also sells alfalfa seeds as a way to earn a little more money. She will use the loan in order to buy supplies for her shop, such as groceries, drinks, and sweets. She is happy for the opportunity and thanks the people who made this loan possible. On the photo, Jaqueline is the second person from the right in the back row, wearing light blue trousers and a red shirt."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1295351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries, drinks, and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2013-03-01T08:13:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-31T08:13:19Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salbino Carnacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cipriana Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jannina Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina Rosaura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaqueline Enma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Marielena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Berenice Nathaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustin Paulino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":937.5,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2408.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355803218},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1204.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364511527},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1204.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372916874}],"funded_date":"2013-03-02T08:06:11Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:07:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":528279,"name":"Hai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hai was born in 1985.

Jos\u00e9 is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help he will be able to buy a small stove, which will help him a lot, since the stove he has now is not in good condition. It has imperfections and leaks. This way, he will be able to prepare his food more safely. Jos\u00e9 will keep working to advance.

He is a very friendly, hard-working, and enthusiastic person, who puts all his efforts into advancing his children, since he is father and mother to them. Unfortunately, due to a lack of resources and needing to work, Daniel was unable to study a professional degree, but he would like to have done so. In his free time, he likes to relax and listen to a little music, and sometimes he cooks a delicious roast chicken to share with his family.

He works every day, starting early in the morning, and he may work for eight hours. He is comfortable in his work and believes that it is going well for him because of his good performance and responsibility.

She has faced many difficult times but with much strength and the love of her family, she has been able to pick herself up and keep fighting her battles in life. A year ago she and husband became separated. This continues to be a difficult situation that has greatly affected her two children ages 13 and 15. Since the separation, Luz's ex-husband stopped helping her with their children's expenses, so she is solely responsible for the well-being of her home. \r\n\r\nLuz worked for several years in a beauty salon, where she learned the trade.

Thanks to the seasoning and the good service, the sausages have become famous.  \r\n\r\nCurrently they are looking to improve the production process, with the goal of optimizing resources and eliminating downtime.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan in order to invest in raw materials and a grinding machine.  He hopes that this investment will allow him to improve his family's quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1297913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He also has a small plot of land on which he grows regional products such as cacao, yucca, and other things.  He believes it's going well for him in his business because he serves the customers very well.  He likes for people to speak of the good service he gives them because more customers look for him to buy his products.  Also, God protects him and helps him do things honorably and with respect for others.\r\n\r\nRafael is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because with their help he'll be able to buy school supplies such as books, notebooks, uniforms, and other things, because the school year begins soon in the city.  This way his children will have the materials they need to be able to go to school without any problem.\r\n\r\nHe's going to continue striving to be able to get ahead and continue saving to realize his big dream: \"To give his children an education and a mini-market.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1298898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to buy school supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-01T08:15:46Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-31T08:15:46Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":135.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":138.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":146.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":149.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":157.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":161.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":175.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":181.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":188.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":195.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":203.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.6,"local_amount":135.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":135.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776443},{"amount":53.65,"local_amount":138.46,"processed_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":138.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483256},{"amount":56.6,"local_amount":146.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":146.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889293},{"amount":57.94,"local_amount":149.52,"processed_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":149.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664199},{"amount":60.9,"local_amount":157.17,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":157.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775424},{"amount":127.56,"local_amount":329.18,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":329.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778942},{"amount":365.75,"local_amount":943.88,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":945.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054142}],"funded_date":"2013-03-02T17:34:34Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:15:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":530159,"name":"Alle","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Alle ag\u00e9 de 36 ans abite dans le sud s\u00e9n\u00e9gal depuis 20ans il est dans le couture,avec ce cr\u00e9dit ,il ach\u00e9te une machine 20u pour mod\u00e9rer ses coutures et \u00e9largire son atelier de travail .\nAlle avec son m\u00e9tier de couture ,il supporte les d\u00e9penses de sa famille compos\u00e9e d'une femme et 1 petit gar\u00e7on de 2ans qui est dans le jardin d'anfents et paye la location de sa chambre et son atelier.Il ambitionne avoir son propre terrain dan la ville.Il remerci l'u imcec et kiva\n\n\n\n","en":"Alle is 36 years old and lives in southern Senegal.

","en":"67-year-old Francisca lives in the city of Le\u00f3n and is the mother of five children.  Her business is selling soft drinks made from natural ingredients.  She is grateful for the opportunity she received from Kiva through her previous loan which she used to buy fruit and spices to make her natural drinks.  As an entrepreneurial woman who strives to continue making progress every day, Francisca would like to gain other sources of income which will help her to achieve her goal of improving the infrastructure of her business.  She needs this loan to buy dishes, spoons, glasses, and melamine forks and spoons to sell.  She would like to gradually invest her profits in another type of income-generating business so that she has something else besides selling her soft drinks.
