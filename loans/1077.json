The group is comprised of both women and men whose major activity is farming and small-scale trade. They fall into different categories including widows, single mothers and a few who are married. \r\n\r\nLydia is a widow, mother of  four children. She lost her husband six years back. Her four children are all in school; one dependent helps her in her restaurant business.  \r\n\r\nLydia is mainly a small-scale trader with a small restaurant with running capital of UGX 500,000. She supplements her restaurant business with income from her cotton farm which she resorted to after losing her husband so that she could look after her children and send them to good schools, which she does single-handedly.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy more food items and utensils for the restaurant and invest some in cotton farming.

His plan is to see his children finish school and have a bright future. He also wises to borrow more money in order to buy a piece of land and build a home for his children and wife.

old, married, and is raising 5 children.  Her youngest is a daughter who will soon turn 2.  Salamat has received a higher education and has been working with livestock since 1998.  She also offers shepherd services.  She started her business initially with 30,000 KGS.  Today, in her care, Salamat has 1 horse and 6 sheep.  She brings in around 8,000 KGS a month from the sale of cattle.

","en":"Karagyz is 47 years old, married and has 2 children.  Karagyz grew up in a family of farmers; her parents have been involved with livestock for a very long time.  Two years ago, with their wide range of experience and knowledge, Karagyz and her family begin to work with livestock as well.  Currently, she has a well-developed business and brings in around 10,000 KGS monthly from the sale of milk and other dairy products.

He was born into a large family of farmers.  In his childhood, he helped his father care for a large farm, and in doing so, he acquired many skills.  By profession, Japar is a teacher and has worked for many years in a rural school.  However, since the pay in Kyrgyzstan is very little, the main source of income for him and his family is livestock and farming.  Japar has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 60,000 KGS to buy sheep and fertilizers for his land.  Japar's business plans involve expanding his farm.

She wants to start purchasing and selling cattle since this is a more profitable business and requires less effort.  With this goal in mind, Muhabbat is taking out a loan to buy cattle.  She will fatten them up over a period of a few months and then resell them at a premium.  With the additional profits made possible by the loan, she plans on increasing her herd.  She will also be able to pay for her oldest son's wedding.

He's very energetic and lives with his parents.  He has not yet married and he is unable to continue his studies due to financial limitations.  For this reason, he is trying to earn and save enough money to begin attending a university next year. Shohruh buys young cows, fattens them up for a time, and then sells them at market.  This process takes two years.  With this loan, he plans on purchasing cattle and further expanding his business.  He is grateful to Arvand for their financial support.

He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a water pump so that he may irrigate his vegetable farm.\n\nOscar started his business of farming vegetables for the local market in 2003. Currently he produces fresh maize, cabbage, and tomatoes. While his business is growing at a fast rate, his farm remains small and is limited by the seasons. He is also unable to expand his current crops as he is forced to fetch water with a bucket.\n\nEquipment such as a water pump can be a major boost for many vegetable farmers such as Oscar, as it allows for increased production and more predictable yields due to irrigation. Unfortunately, it is rare to find equipment such as a water pump in such a remote region of the country, and transport to the capital city (two days travel) can be prohibitive. Once Oscar secures a loan, he will be able to get a water pump from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it.\n\nWith a pump, whether in the rainy season or dry season, Oscar will be able to produce and sell a range of produce throughout the year, unlike at the moment where he has a shortage of water during the dry season. The use of a pump will also mean that he can irrigate a larger portion of land in less time and not be restricted by the labor-intensive task of carrying water by hand to his field.\n\nOscar added that when he starts producing more products, he would like to extend his business to be able to serve markets in other nearby communities.\n\nIt is for this reason Oscar is appealing to the Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure a water pump as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1303869,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2844,"youtubeId":"Au8e1Enkglc","title":"Kiva Borrower

She has raised 4 children; her youngest, a daughter, is in elementary school.  Her son is currently working in Russia.  Her husband and son help Kanayim in her work.  She is, by character, a very nice and sympathetic woman.  She is very sociable and energetic.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, the family began working in agriculture.  Now, the family raises cattle and crops.  The gross annual income for the family is around 150,000 KGS.

She is a single mother and head of her family of three children. Her husband abandoned her, so she assumed the responsibilities of the home and of generating enough income to pay expenses, affording her children food and education.\r\n\r\nShe says she began learning the clothing trade at a young age through family tradition, and since taking charge of family obligations, she decided to hire third parties to work in her own clothing shop. Currently, Nora is requesting a loan she will invest in the purchase of a two-needle sewing machine, which will allow her to optimize during times of production and increase revenue.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to see her clothing shop grow, increase sales and generate new sources of employment, especially for mothers who are heads of family and who do not have job opportunities.

She hopes the manure will increase her plantain production and she will therefore invest the gained profit in her restaurant and hopefully her revenue will eventually double. She can then construct a building to house her restaurant in the future instead of renting. She is optimistic about her family's future,  especially now that she will be partnering with Kiva lenders. Her major challenges are a lack of customers, customers who eat on credit and take long time to pay and a limited capital base which has to be shared between sustaining her business and paying tuition.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1302822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"To buy organic manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-03-02T09:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-01T09:30:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91356.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589871},{"amount":0.83,"local_amount":2120,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2213.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993832},{"amount":67.92,"local_amount":172880,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":180499.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040535},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":91356.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831164},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":91356.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689384},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91356.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480527},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":182713,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983398}],"funded_date":"2013-03-02T11:17:33Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T21:12:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jonathan Hiebert","image":852394}},{"id":532578,"name":"Mamie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamie is 43 years old, she and her fiancee live in Congo Town, Montserrado County which has the largest port and is the number one commercial county in Liberia.

She lives in the Sighnaghi District with her husband and a grandson who goes to the local school. She requested loans from local financial institutions several times in order to start an agricultural business, but did not have success. Her loan requests were rejected every time due to low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly retirement pension of Gulo and her husband. Seasonally, the family sells the harvested maize that was grown on the family-owned land. It is hardly enough for the family to cover everyday expanses. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nGulo requested a loan from Credo to start a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up program loans money for business start-ups and \"re-startups.\" It provides access to credit with less rigid conditions for the country's rural poor, who usually do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Gulo will purchase a milk cow. She will place it in the old, empty farm building located in their yard. She will work hard on the farm. She will produce cheese and sell it in the village. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income. Gulo and her husband will be able to spend their senility in a more comfortable environment and rear their grandson to be well-educated as well.

He lives in Zestaponi District, West Georgia, with his wife and four children (three of them are under-aged). Mevludi leads his family's small-scale agricultural business. He runs a family-owned dairy farm, with two calves and two milk cows. Mevludi produces cheese and sells it in the village. In addition, he owns four pigs and sells piglets seasonally. The income is not enough to provide Mevludi and his family with adequate living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nMevludi has requested a loan from Credo to restart his seasonal business. His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with fewer conditions to the country's rural poor for business start-ups and restart-ups. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low incomes, and they often do not have access to credit. With the loan, Mevludi will purchase chickens to restart a poultry farm. He will place the chickens in a shed located in their yard. He will raise them to sell them for a higher price. He hopes that the new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the
