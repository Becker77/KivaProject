Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The store has been profitable project, but it needs more support (capital) to further develop. Several times she has asked for loans from local financial institutions to develop her business, but without success. Her loan requests were rejected each time, because of her low income.\r\n\r\nVera\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, called the Start-up Loan Program. This program provides credit for business start-ups and restart-ups, with soft conditions, to the rural poor who do not have access to ordinary credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Vera will cover the costs of purchasing more inventory, of basic groceries that customers often request. She has already rented a new commercial space, which has a better location. She plans to increase the turnover in her trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Start-up Loan from Kiva, will significantly increase the income of the family. Vera will work hard, and she will be able to improve the living conditions for her family. With this loan, her family will generate enough income to access regularly-available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event that they need

Rosa Alicia already has a wide customer base, since she sells fresh, high quality produce at affordable prices and with excellent service.\r\n\r\nRosa Alicia is an entrepreneurial woman who is dedicated to her work and goals in life, and she is always looking for new opportunities to grow her business and succeed.

He hails from the village of Mirama in the Mbarara district. He grew up without his parents after both of them died when he was at a very tender age. Issac was brought up by his grandmother who also died when he was just 15 years old. He then worked on people\u2019s farms where he looked after goats. Because of his trustworthiness, he was given five goats as a gift, which laid the foundation for his success. He looked after those goats, and they multiplied to become over 30 goats. He used some of his goats to make a marriage offer and to acquire land to plant plantains. Last month he sold more than half of his goats to buy a piece of land for the rest of his goats to graze.

Nagarote is known for its traditional food such as curd cheese and tiste (a beverage made from roasted corn, cocoa, annatto fruit, and sugar.) Lesbia is known to be a person with a great sense of responsibility, which has been demonstrated in her previous loans. \r\n\r\nThanks to her desire to succeed she has as an economic activity a pulper\u00eda located at home.

She is a widow and a mother to her children. She, with the help of her children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nBalbina operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat only home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nBalbina hopes her business will expand and dreams that the time will come when she will no longer need to borrow money. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She is married to Lorenzo and they have children.  She and her husband manage their household while also operating a business.  She is working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEdna operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and then selling them by the piece.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.  She is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan to help her continue in the operation of her business.  She will use the loan to expand her product inventory by purchasing groceries, toiletries, and beverages.\r\n\r\nEdna hopes to expand her business and dreams to have their own house.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, and to repay loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1303459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages for her variety store.

During this season, the prices of building materials are at their lowest, so Natsagdorj wants to purchase building materials now, such as bricks, cement, wood planks, and metals. In addition to repairing the house, he wants to build a garage on his land, because during the winter time, the vehicle left outside becomes less efficient, using more fuel and emitting more smoke to the environment.\r\n\r\nConcerning the above-mentioned reasons, he is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to cover the costs of repairing the house and building a garage. As a result, his insulated and renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, and his newly-built garage will protect his micro van from strong storms and frosts, thus ensuring the efficient operation of the vehicle. All of those actions can contribute to efforts against air pollution, and will give the family the comfortable, warm house they need.

The group is located in Acatlan de Perez Figueroa, a municipality of the state of Oaxaca. Since it is a municipality, it has a lot of business activity because people from the surrounding towns come here to buy the merchandise and goods that they need.\r\n\r\nLuz Yahel, or Luz, as she is called in her community, has had a small grocery store in her home for a little more than two years. She opened her own business because she wanted to work in her free time to contribute to the home expenses, and after speaking with her husband they decided to put a store in their home so that she did not have to leave her home and neglect the children.\r\n\r\nShe said, \"First of all, I would like to thank Vision Fund for believing in us and helping us to create our own sources of employment, which also helps my family.\"\r\n\r\nLuz is 36 years old and only studied in high school. She is married to Eloy, with whom she has one child.\r\n\r\nThis loan from Vision Fund will help her to buy beans, rice, oil, soap, toothpaste, soup, toilet paper, cookies, sugar, salt, canned goods, sweets, and soft drinks to restock her business.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to give her son the opportunity to study a profession and to have a better life. She also wants her business to continue improving and to stock it more.\r\n\r\nThis group sends its thanks to the people who will make their loan possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1302550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy beans, rice, oil, soap, toothpaste, soup, toilet paper, cookies, sugar, salt, canned goods, sweets, and soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-03-03T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-02T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Yahel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angel Maddiel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":393.75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5057.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596103},{"amount":590.63,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":7586.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663531},{"amount":393.75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5057.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048945},{"amount":196.87,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2528.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840110}],"funded_date":"2013-03-03T23:19:37Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":533618,"name":"Ku\u00f1a Rory 2 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo de la cuidad de Encarnaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 en su ciclo numero 4, donde todas las integrantes son mujeres jefas de familia que se esfuerzan por dar a sus familias todo lo que necesitan.\nUna de las integrantes del grupo es la Sra.

Dorcas group. She lives with her husband and seven children in a village. \r\n\r\nIn 2011, she availed a loan from WSDS to start her weaving activities. She weaved traditional shawls and wrap-around skirts for women. In order to supplement the family income she ventured into this activity, which is something she is good at.\r\n\r\nNow she needs a loan to do better with her weaving activities.

He hopes, in future, to be in a position to buy more land to expand his business and increase his output.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1303124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"To buy mulch, pestcides and fuel for running his generator","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-03-03T16:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-02T16:30:14Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zavuga","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":152814.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589883},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":152814.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993844},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":152814.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040547},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":152814.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831176},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":152814.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689396},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":152814.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879715},{"amount":88.68,"local_amount":231341,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":235681.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983408},{"amount":55.66,"local_amount":145210,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":147934.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635545},{"amount":26.07,"local_amount":68000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":69275.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863800},{"amount":59.59,"local_amount":155449,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":158365.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752953}],"funded_date":"2013-03-04T22:50:16Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T13:34:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":533042,"name":"Mamia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamia, age 50, would like to start up a small dairy farm business.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMamia has requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business, and his loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Mamia will start up a small dairy farm. He will purchase a milk cow and a piglet with the loan funds. With the milk from the cow, the family will make cheese products and sell these locally at the market. After they raise the piglet, it will be sold at a profitable mark-up. \r\n\r\nThis new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family income and improve the entire family's standard of living. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1303690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a milk cow and a piglet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Vakevisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-03T16:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-02T16:30:14Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":71.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.61,"local_amount":48.61,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":48.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570268},{"amount":55.68,"local_amount":55.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":55.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968900},{"amount":56.15,"local_amount":56.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":56.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749318},{"amount":58.42,"local_amount":58.42,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":58.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613224},{"amount":59.05,"local_amount":59.05,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":59.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856948},{"amount":922.09,"local_amount":922.09,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:03:50Z","rounded_local_amount":922.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133607}],"funded_date":"2013-03-08T23:58:01Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:03:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":533045,"name":"Jasmin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jasmin is a 24-year-old married woman with two kids from Maribojoc, Bohol.

","en":"Gulnora is a skilled seamstress, having begun sewing in her childhood.  She sews beautiful national dresses for women.  She also skillfully embroiders beads and decorative flowers that she uses to adorn her dresses.  Her talent is masterful.  As a youth, she took lessons from a skilled artisan.  There, she learned all the details of her craft.  As Gulnora herself has said, her teacher was very demanding but managed to pass along her skills and mold her into the talent she is today.  When Gulnora started her family and had three children, the need for income increased and she decided to open her own shop.  Six years ago, she and a few of her seamstress friends rented a space near a market.  initially, Gulnora used a sewing machine that she rented with the space.  But she later decided she wanted to buy a new sewing machine for herself.  For the means to do so, she turned to Arvand.  With their support, she did just that.  Now, with the increasing needs of her family, she wants to buy her own embroidery machine.  With this machine, her small business will be able to survive and she will be able to continue to offer her services to a larger number of clients.  This will allow her to earn enough money for her family and her children's education.  She hopes that this loan from Arvand will help her advance closer to her goals and to move past this difficult time.

His wife supports him in running the business and producing additional income. He has been in this business for the last three years and earns a monthly profit of Kshs 10,000. \r\n\r\nMaurice and his wife are blessed with three children.\r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan in the amount of Kshs 91,000 from KADET Ltd, which he intends to use to start a new barber shop business.

","en":"Davlat is married and lives in Istaravshan, Tajikistan with his wife and two children.  He's a hardworking and honest man. His wife raises their children and does not work outside of the home.  Davlat has worked the last four years buying and selling auto parts; this is the family's sole source of income.

He lives in a village where this sort of work is very important.  He receives a good income from reselling his cattle.  He has big plans for the future and dreams that his children will be able to receive a higher education and that they will find good jobs.  Mahmudjon also wants to build a home for his only son.  He is already thinking of his son's future and hopes that in his old age, his son will be a mainstay.  In order to start building a home, Mahmudjon plans to increase the number of cattle among his herd and therefore expand his business.  Then, with the money he's saved, he will begin construction.

His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBesik is working as a builder on private orders. His family has one milk cow, and Besik\u2019s wife is milking it everyday to make cheese. They sell it locally at the market and get a very small monthly income. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs within the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBesik requested a loan from Credo to start-up his family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor which do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Besik will purchase a mini-bus to transport building materials. He will work on transportation and earn additional monthly income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will help him to develop his business which will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

It has eight members and an executive board, with Susana as president. The members of the group are engaged in various activities, among them cattle trading, baby-clothes sewing, api (a popular drink made with sweetcorn and sugar, usually drunk while eating dumplings) sales, catering, and lamb-meat sales. This loan will thus benefit a group of very small entrepreneurs with diverse businesses. Susana tells us that she has been working with Pro Mujer for two years. She got to know this field partner thanks to a spokesperson, who came to visit her at her house. Susana sells api, a trade she learned from her family, who has been in it for thirty years.

She comes from Managua, in the West of the country. She likes to cook and share with her children a local delicacy, named 'g\u00fcirilas', which are a type of sweetcorn pancake. Due to her lack of financial resources, she was not able to go to university, but she would have liked to study nutrition. Thanks to her enterprising spirit and her desire to get ahead in life, she has her own business: a taxi service. She drives people around the city some twelve hours per day. She is happy to have this business, as this is what feeds her and her children. She needs the loan to perform maintenance on her taxi by greasing some parts as well as changing what needs to be changed: the tyres, the brakes, and the valve.

Also, he runs a dairy farm with four milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. The cheese is sold at the local open market. \r\n\r\nSulkhan has requested credit for the purpose of building a greenhouse. The new business will be an additional source of income for the family, which will allow them to combat the poverty in which they live. \r\n\r\nSulkhan\u2019s loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program offers business start-up capital and re-startup credit with generous lending conditions to the country's rural poor, who often do not have access to credit, as they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Sulkhan will purchase materials for the greenhouse construction (iron pillars and polyethylene covering) and will then construct the greenhouse, where tomatoes and greens will be grown throughout the year. Sulkhan will work in the greenhouse himself. He will sell the harvested products at the local open market. The income of the family will significantly increase, and they will be able to improve their living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1303814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase building materials and construct a greenhouse.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Maghlaki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-03T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-02T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sulkhan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":136.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":147.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.19},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":155.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":158.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":163.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":169.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":173.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":178.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":183.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":188.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":194.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.59,"local_amount":136.48,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":138.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570271},{"amount":90.46,"local_amount":147.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":149.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968903},{"amount":91.99,"local_amount":150.19,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":152.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749321},{"amount":95.52,"local_amount":155.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":157.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613227},{"amount":97.37,"local_amount":158.98,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":161.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856951},{"amount":100.18,"local_amount":163.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":165.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133610},{"amount":103.66,"local_amount":169.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":171.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107210},{"amount":562.23,"local_amount":917.92,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":929.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254783}],"funded_date":"2013-03-05T21:33:02Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T10:25:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":533718,"name":"Maria Auxiliadora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria, una humilde campesina de 55 a\u00f1os, casada, madre de 7 hijos, originaria de Le\u00f3n, fue beneficiada con un cr\u00e9dito, le trajo cambios positivo logro comprar insumos necesarios que necesitaba para sembrar yuca vendi\u00f3 su producci\u00f3n, y fue muy buena venta.

With the received credit, Shota will purchase a truck to transport wood from the forest. The wood will be sold in his village and in nearby villages. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of his

All her life she has worked to take care of her home and ensure the well-being her three children. Three months ago she started a vegetable stand in order to generate more income for her household as her economic condition is currently poor and uncertain due to the fact that her spouse is unemployed at present. \r\n\r\nHer primary goal is to stock the vegetable stand and expand the range of products and services she provides for the standard family basket of goods in order to offer her customers better quality and service. This way she will generate a higher volume of sales. For this reason she is requesting a loan which she will use to purchase vegetables, soft drinks, and pastries. She hopes her business will allow her to improve the quality of life in her home, stabilize the financial crisis her family currently faces, and guarantee her youngest child access to higher

It would help her to complete the orders of her customers on time, which ultimately helps in generating more cash. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1303750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more spools of threads with packs of sequins, pearls and glittering material of better quality.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-03-04T03:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-03T03:20:01Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1062},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1093},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1157},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1191},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1226},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1262},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1299},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1337},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1376},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1456}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.14,"local_amount":2155,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2468.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355848486},{"amount":13.12,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1288.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364557244},{"amount":13.5,"local_amount":1157,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1325.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372955747},{"amount":13.89,"local_amount":1191,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1364.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381735473},{"amount":14.3,"local_amount":1226,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390822626},{"amount":14.72,"local_amount":1262,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1445.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399842973},{"amount":15.15,"local_amount":1299,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1488.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410117772},{"amount":15.6,"local_amount":1337,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1531.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419883017},{"amount":49.58,"local_amount":4248,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4866.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439755448}],"funded_date":"2013-03-04T05:00:29Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:41:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":533174,"name":"Musarat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Musarat is a 56-year-old married woman.
