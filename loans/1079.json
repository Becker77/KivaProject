The main source of income for the family is the small monthly salary Nino's father earns by working locally as a rescue. Besides that, the family runs a small-scale agricultural business. In particular, they grow nuts and potatoes on the family-owned land and sell the harvested products at the local market. \r\n\r\nNino used to run clothing sales business, but her project has recently stopped because of financial problems. She requested a loan from Credo to re-start a clothing sales business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program seeks to provide business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to traditional credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nNino will purchase clothes in the capital city's open market at wholesale prices and resell them in her district for a profit. It will be hard work for Nino, but according to estimates, her business will be profitable because she has enough experience in this field. \r\n\r\nThe trading business will increase the income of Nino's family, and the profit will be reinvested back into her clothing trading business to enlarge her stock and sales volume. Her family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1303867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase clothing for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Aspindza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-04T04:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-03T04:00:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nino ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":33.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":48.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.02,"local_amount":33.87,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":36.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570276},{"amount":23.89,"local_amount":36.76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":39.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968908},{"amount":24.32,"local_amount":37.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":40.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749326},{"amount":25.27,"local_amount":38.89,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":41.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613232},{"amount":25.79,"local_amount":39.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":42.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856956},{"amount":26.55,"local_amount":40.85,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":43.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133615},{"amount":177.16,"local_amount":272.55,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":292.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107215}],"funded_date":"2013-03-05T04:48:35Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:38:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beth Janicek","image":null}},{"id":533741,"name":"Danilo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Danilo un humilde agricultor quien se dedica a la siembra de caf\u00e9, agradece la oportunidad que le brindo el cr\u00e9dito Kiva fue de mucha ayuda, pues llego cuando mas lo necesitaba le permiti\u00f3 invertir en sus siembras,  para el mantenimiento de caf\u00e9 y pagar mano de obra.

He stands out as an enterprising person with a desire to move up in life, as his business has grown so much that he sells to restaurants and in other parts of the country. F\u00e9lix is requesting the loan because he wants to expand his market even more, purchasing vehicles for distribution, and in this way make headway for all of his children, who look to him as an example of self-improvement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1304780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

In addition, Merab\u2019s father is involved in dairy farming and has a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese products. \r\n\r\nMerab requested a loan from Credo to start up a joiner\u2019s workshop. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to countryside rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit he will purchase wooden materials and a joiner\u2019s plane. \r\n\r\nMerab is sure that his start-up business will be successful, as his district is quite popular among tourists. Thus, small hostels are being constructed. Merab will supply them with quality furniture for a convenient price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will increase the income of his family. The family members will then be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1303890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

She lives in the Akhmeta district of East Georgia with her husband, son, daughter and father, who is provided with a retirement pension.\r\nOn several occasions Ketevan has requested a loan from local financial institutions for an agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were always rejected because lack of experience in the business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. All the family members work hard to improve their living conditions. Ketevan is a worker at the local wine factory and gets a small monthly salary. The family has a plot of land where they grow maize. The crops they harvest are sold locally. Ketevan also has a milk cow, whose milk is used in dairy products. In addition, family members harvest grapes on the family-owned vineyard and produce wine for selling. Ketevan\u2019s husband has a tractor and performs agricultural work on the lands of nearby farmers during tilling season.\r\nKetevan is now requesting a loan for her agricultural business. The loan program provides businesses with start-up funding to assist the country's rural poor, who do not have access to most credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan proceeds, Ketevan would like to purchase a fertilizer spreader.

Ramin requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nRamin is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has 2 milk cows and a pig. Besides, he has 500 nut trees and a vineyard with 200 vine trees. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\nRamin requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

His other two children, who are 2 and 7 years old respectively, both go to kindergarten. \r\n\r\nSergelenkhuu has been working as a field engineer for a private business for six years. The house the family lives in has been deteriorating over the years and needs some serious repair.

So he is requesting a loan of 4,500,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials, including but not limited to fiberglass, hardwood floors, glue and wallpaper. During this time of year, the price of building materials reaches its lowest rate so it is a good time to buy these materials. \r\n\r\nAfter the repairs have been made, the family will be able to live with joy and happiness due to having a warm house. This also will enable the family to burn less coal, thereby reducing air pollution. (In Mongolia, air pollution is mainly caused by the burning of coal.)

They sell the harvested nuts locally. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Su emprendimiento surgi\u00f3 cuando trabajando su esposo,  como empleado en una empresa de producci\u00f3n de mechas de trapero, los propietarios de esta, le propusieron que comprara el material y se dedicara a elaborar los productos, garantizando sus antiguos patronos su venta, pues  ellos comprar\u00edan lo producido, y as\u00ed lo hizo en compa\u00f1\u00eda de Malvis, quien dirige todos sus esfuerzos a sacar adelante su peque\u00f1a f\u00e1brica artesanal.

","en":"Since 2001, Malvis, who is 36, has been making flannel strands for mops, using very manual methods. This business has allowed her and her husband to increase their family's wellbeing. They have four children who are ages thirteen to seventeen. \r\n\r\nTheir business venture started when her husband was working for a company that made mop strands and the owners proposed that he purchase the material and make the product himself. His ex-employers guaranteed their product's sales, because they would buy as much as they made, so that is what he did along with Malvis, who dedicates all of her effort to keep her small manufacturing business going. \r\n\r\nThe raw material they need is bought in bales in the city of Bogot\u00e1, and is transformed in their home, where they live and work daily, Monday through Friday from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm. Her goal is to increase production, but she doesn't have the infrastructure to improve their production time. Working capital is another big challenge, because it doesn't allow her make significant enough purchases to obtain discounts for buying large amounts of raw material. \r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a Kiva loan which will be her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to purchase a machine and cotton material, in order to include a new line of mop strands to increase her profits. Her goal for her family is to be able to support each of her children's professional education, so that they can have a very promising

At the age of 17, he moved with his family to the city of Barranquilla. \r\n\r\nSo as not to lose the connection with his hometown, he started his own business, intuitively interpreting the needs of the market segment, how to access the excellent food products produced in Santa Cruz de Mompox, and finally with his own life experience, he managed to transport goods for daily consumption to Baranquilla and sell them in a market. That was how he gained his first experience - selling whey, cheese and corn rolls to freinds and neighbors. \r\n\r\nGradually the quality of the products he was selling got its own results and today he has an established clientele and a good reputation in the market. He has also acquired working capital, which he invests in his business and with the profits, he maintains his home, and has even managed to enter the market of buying and selling cattle which he does in his hometown. \r\n\r\nLately, faced with the acquiring all the products that he sells to meet growing demand, and faced with the necessity to strengthen his cattle business, he has found that his working capital is insufficient to achieve this, so he is requesting a loan to buy cheese, rolls, whey, cookies and a bull. This is the third loan that he will receive from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this assistance, he is able to increase his liquidity, sales and profits.

Zinakan's husband died unexpectedly in 1998, and she was left alone with three children. Since then, Zinakan has married two daughters away. \r\n\r\nIn search of a main source of income for her family, Zinakan has been selling children's clothing since the collapse of the Soviet Union, after having started this business with an amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zinakan's persistent work, she currently has her own selling point at the market. It is at a good location, with a lot of people passing by, and she has 200,000 som (KGS) in turnover. The business brings in around 15,000 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zinakan turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) to increase the assortment of children's goods. Zinakan will invest the income from the loan in further developing her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1305347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To  increase the assortment of children goods for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karakol town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-04T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-03T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zinakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9315},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9579},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9850},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10129},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10416},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10711}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":197.94,"local_amount":9315,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9410.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754928},{"amount":203.56,"local_amount":9579,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":9676.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458955},{"amount":209.31,"local_amount":9850,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9950.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863088},{"amount":664.19,"local_amount":31256,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-27T08:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":31575.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631618}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T00:34:19Z","paid_date":"2013-07-27T08:39:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":533490,"name":"Alaywi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alaywi is an Iraqi client who is 52 years old and has two wives and two children.

in the village Orke, which is in the south of Kyrgyzstan. She is the mother of six children - two sons and four daughters. Tursun is 53 years old, and she was born into a simple farmer's family. Since childhood she helped her mother with the household and loved doing household chores. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing school she got a job at a local collective farm as a laboratory assistant for dairy products. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of collective farms, Tursun and her husband started working with livestock breeding. They started this business with 5,000 som (KGS).

","en":"Mehriniso is a very hard working and purposeful woman. She was born in a rural area and has sufficient experience with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. After school she worked in the field, in order to earn money and help her parents. \r\n\r\nMehriniso especially grows wheat, sweet corn and other agricultural products. She has run this business independently for more than 6 months. She sells the harvest directly to the local residents at a lower price than at the market. With an aim to increase her skills, Mehriniso took part in the training \"Woman Entrepreneur, Get Ahead\", held by the Association of Business Women and \"IMON International\", in partnership with the International Labor Organization. \r\n\r\nThis year, due to unfavorable weather, Mehriniso was not able to get a normal harvest.

He lives in Senaki District with his wife Nato, who is also 49 years old. Several times, Anzor requested loans from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nAnzor and his wife are farmers. They have one milk cow and one calf. Nato milks the cow every day and makes cheese, which she sells locally at the markets. They also have plot of agricultural land, where maize and nut trees are grown. Anzor is cultivating land every spring, before sowing. Harvested products are also sold at the local markets. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nAnzor requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Anzor will purchase cement for his construction block workshop, which is not functional at the moment.

three-year-old son. She lives together with her small family in a brick house which they rent. With the arrival of her little one, she decided to drop the work she was doing at the time, which consisted of the laborious and near constant work of selling clothing, in order to look after their child. Thus their primary source of income was Fredy, who works as a bus driver on provincial routes. As a way of reentering the workforce she hopes to open up a business selling cellular phones, accessories, and calling cards. She believes this is a good business opportunity because there are not many businesses of this type in her town. Her long term goal is to purchase her own vehicle so that both she and Fredy may contribute to household finances. This is her first loan cycle with MFP, and she promises to make punctual payments on her loan as a way of demonstrating her complete gratitude. In this cycle she is seeking 500 nuevos soles to supplement her own money in order to purchase cell phone accessories such as chargers, headsets, and other products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1305573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase telephone accessories.

His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land where they grow citrus and nut trees. Harvested products are sold locally, at the market, and the family gets a small monthly income that is not enough to feed a five-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRecently, Manuchar requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Credo approved his loan request, in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit, with soft conditions, to Georgia's rural poor people, who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Manuchar will purchase a minibus and work on the line. He will transport people between his village and Batumi, and will earn a monthly income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up Loan, will increase the family's income and enable them to have better living conditions.

She lives in Mtskheta District with her husband, parents-in-law and two children who are going to school.  Manana requested a loan for the family business from local financial institutions several times but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The family has two milk cows. Manana and her mother-in-law are milking the cows every day to make cheese which is sold locally at the markets. They also have a car which Manana\u2019s husband and father-in-law are using as a taxi to drive local people. According to Credo's estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nManana requested a loan from Credo to strengthen the family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the credit received, Manana will purchase a car and it will be used as a taxi. Her husband and father-in-law both work in separate cars as drivers to increase the family income. The profit will be used to buy more cows and produce more milk to make cheese. The new business initiative, financed with this Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Makassar is one of the largest cities in Indonesia and has all the problems third world cities have: including a lack of access to safe and affordable drinking.  That is why Sunaani started to sell Nazava Water Filters.  So far she has been very successful: Three times she ordered water filtersand each time all her filters were sold out within a day. \nBecause Sulawesi is an island, the filters need to be shipped with an unreliable and slow boat service which needs almost two weeks to get the Nazava Water Filters to mrs Sunaani. That is why she is in urgent need of more stock. Besides, the shipping costs would be reduce by almost 50 % when she orders a few more boxes. \u201cMany many people here want a filter, but I do not have money to increase my stock\u201d, as Sunaani told to Nazava\u2019s sales manager. \nWith a Kiva loan, Mrs Sunaani can make safe and affordable drinking water available to 1000 people in just 1 month. The loan allows her to buy around 200 water filters for a bigger discount and with lower transportation costs. By supporting Mrs. Sunaani, it\u2019s not only her business that will be boosted but more families will have access to safe and affordable drinking water and these families will also save money and increase their disposable income. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1305550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy a larger stock of water filters and increase the access to safe and affordable drinking water in her region.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Makassar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2013-03-05T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-04T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sunaani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1074.55,"local_amount":1074.55,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1074.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373537267},{"amount":925.45,"local_amount":925.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-30T08:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":925.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381768363}],"funded_date":"2013-03-05T06:50:26Z","paid_date":"2013-07-30T08:49:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":533605,"name":"Abamwe Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet is a married woman aged 46.

Her mother immigrated to the United States with the goal of finding more economic stability and a home.  Ingrid works as a coordinator for social and religious events, and she decorates the locations where the events take place.  Generally, they take place in a well-known hotel situated on the beaches of El Cuco.  She has worked with the hotel since 2009, and her job has provided her the income necessary to maintain her business and to finish her degree in information technology.  \r\n\r\nAll of the supplies and materials that she uses are found in the a city that is 45 kilometers from the city in which she lives.  The temporary workers that she hires are from the beach area, and they have been trained by state institutions and NGOs in customer service.  \r\n\r\nIngrid will invest this loan in her business: $200 for decoration materials and $800 to buy tables and chairs.  With this investment, her teams and services will be of better quality.  Sometimes the tables and chairs that she rents are very worn down, and they don't provide the image, presentation and feel required for such events.  Because of the good job that she does, Ingrid is becoming well-known, and she hopes to grow her business and to provide her services in other high-class hotels.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1305622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy decorating materials and $800 for the purchase of tables and chairs for her business.

His business is small, but it has significant growth potential, because he has gradually built a customer base and his customers refer him to others.  This makes him very motivated to grow the business.  He doesn't have enough working capital to finance his dream of expanding his business, and so this is why he applied for a Kiva loan.  This is the first financing that he has arranged through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With this loan, he will buy printing equipment so that he will be able to respond promptly and effectively to the demands of the market.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"When I was eight years old my father thought it was time to learn to weave on a floor loom, just like he did. My products are associated with the history of Guatemala; for example, our ancestors used to place the tortillas in a square holder woven by the women on a backstrap loom. Now, that same tortilla holder is used as a placemat or napkin. I have taught the art of weaving to more than 80 people and now I dedicate most of my time to designing new colors with natural dyes, innovating weaving techniques and supervising apprentices.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really appreciated your assistance with the first micro-credit, which helped me buy the materials to develop a number of new designs. We were able to pay it off completely and on time. Now, I'm requesting a second loan to buy weaving materials for the handbags we are creating. Thank you very much for your support, as we hope to expand the number of designs we craft for you.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Andres's handwoven cotton scarves and handbags on the NOVICA

It has been a profitable project and the only source of income for him, but also it needs more support to cover the costs.\r\n\r\nMohammad is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing needed stock of basic groceries that customers often request, such as rice, sugar, milk and canned food. This will increase sales and increase Mohammad's income. Mohammad is looking in the future to expand his project to improve his income.\r\n\r\nThe photo of Mohammad is in his grocery store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees.

The financial institutions rejected him because of his low income and poor living conditions.

According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nDavid asked for a loan from Credo to start up a family business, and it was approved within the framework of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program is intended to lend capital with soft conditions to the rural poor, so they can start up businesses. They would not otherwise have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nDavid plans to buy the rights to work on the mini-bus line with the loan, which means that he will not have to pay rent as he is currently doing. He will own the line, and won\u2019t have to share the income with anybody. David should therefore get a higher income than before, and this will significantly improve the living conditions of his family.

She is a very friendly person, hard working and enthusiastic and she dedicates all her energy into getting her son ahead in life, as she is both mother and father to him.

These will help conserve and prepare healthy food.

","en":"Dagoberto is 63 years old and lives in the south of the city where he makes a living preparing and selling fast and fried foods. He started this business two years ago after reading a book about positive mental attitudes, which inspired him to carry out a different activity to his profession.

She is a young woman who still lives with her parents and studies in an \u201copen\u201d high school (an alternative adult school) on Saturdays in order to have time to help at home with the household chores.  She says that it is the first time that she has asked for a loan and that friends of her mother encouraged her to enter the group \u201cLas Azucenas de Pueblo Nuevo\u201d (Pueblo Nuevo Easter Lilies).  They commented to her that they had given that name to the group because in her home her mother has a very big garden with lily flowers.  \r\n\r\nAna, as she is known, put a grocery store in her house about a year ago in order to be able to work during the week and keep an eye on her home and on her younger siblings since her parents go out to work and also to help pay the tuition fees of the high school.  Ana is requesting a loan from VisionFund to stock a little bit more of everything that she sells like eggs, milk, toilet paper, oil for cooking, diapers, sugar, salt, eggs, tuna, napkins, soft drinks, cookies and some candy in order to sell a little bit of everything.  She says that on Saturdays she goes to a store in her town where they sell wholesale and give her low prices.  She says that later on she wants to sell cold cuts and put in different dairy products.  She says that upon finishing her high school studies she wants to go into studying to be an educator because it would be one of her greatest achievements.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Alma Isabel, Gabriela, Marisela, Fabiola, Mar\u00eda Isabel, Irma, Adelina y Jarintzi.  They will invest in the purchase of bedspreads to sell, in the purchase of supplies to make bread, to stock a grocery store, to buy chicken to sell by the kilo, to buy cosmetics and perfumes to sell and to stock shoes for women and men to sell.
