have worked constantly to make their businesses prosper. <p>\r\nThey are a total of seventeen women whose occupations vary from creating fine artwork to selling vegetables and running grocery stores to running a hostel and preparing fast food. <p>\r\nAll these activities demand great sacrifice on the part of these businesswomen, given that their income and earnings are minimal throughout the year, and they must take advantage of those parties that bring in large crowds. For example, the parties of <i>Carnaval <\/i> bring in many consumers as well as tourism, which in the case of the businesswoman who runs a hostel represents a big opportunity to bring in income that will keep her business afloat. <p>\r\nUnfortunately, the competition in this field does not allow our associate to earn enough to be able to invest in improving and remodeling her hostel, much less to be able to expand the facility and be able to bring her guests greater comfort. <p>\r\nFor this reason, these businesswomen need cash to invest in their businesses so that they can compete in the market that will be created by the Carnaval parties and other parties throughout the year. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLas Divinas, ese es el nombre de la Asociaci\u00f3n Comunal de Villa Tejada, que hace m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o y medio trabajan constantemente con el fin de prosperar con sus negocios.<p>\r\n\r\nUn total de 17 mujeres cuya ocupaci\u00f3n var\u00eda, desde la elaboraci\u00f3n de artesan\u00edas, pasando por la venta de verduras, tiendas de abarrotes, hasta la atenci\u00f3n de un hostal y preparaci\u00f3n de comida r\u00e1pida.<p>\r\n\r\nTodas estas actividades demandan gran sacrificio de parte de estas socias, puesto que sus ingresos y ganancias son m\u00ednimas durante el a\u00f1o, y deben aprovechar aquellas fiestas que mueven grandes masas. Por ejemplo las fiestas de carnaval generan gran movimiento consumista, y al mismo tiempo generan turismo, lo que en el caso de la socia que posee su hostal representa una gran oportunidad para generar ingresos importantes para mantener vivo su negocio.<p>\r\n\r\nLastimosamente la competitividad en el rubro no permite que nuestra socia genere los recursos necesarios por no poder invertir en mejoras y refacciones a su hostal, menos en la posibilidad de ampliaci\u00f3n de infraestructura, mucho menos en gastos que generen mayor comodidad a sus hu\u00e9spedes.<p>\r\n\r\nPor tal motivo, las

from Tanzania! Jane M. is 38 years old and from Mwanza. She is married with two children who are 6 and 10 years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependants whose parents cannot care for them. \r\n<p>\r\nJane has been running a stationary business since 2003. She has demonstrated her business savvy by placing her stationary shops, stalls and tables strategically close to post offices, bookstores, schools and universities. She works at the business for 8 hours per day, 6 days per week. She is assisted by one employee. Jane currently earns about $300 USD from her business per month. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to buy stationary equipment like a scanner, computers and a printer. In the future, she plans to open a new stationary store. Jane thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Although she lives in her parents' house, she doesn't give up on the dream of some day having her own home.  For ten years she has sold meals, which she does in front of her home every day from 6:00-11:00 p.m.  Her customers are her neighbors, who come over hoping to eat something that Kelly has made.  Her job tends to be dangerous on the weekends due to the parties that happen.  She earns a lot of profit, but she risks being robbed by thieves.  This is why she hopes to put a restaurant in her parents' house so she can stop working at night and prepare food in the morning that she can sell throughout the day.  In the time that she has worked with Microfinanzas Prisma, it has been a period of new challenges because her group is very demanding about making punctual payments.

Her eldest son, 17, lives in a village with his grandmother. Her second son is 15 and her daughter is just four and half years old. Her and her husband hold interesting occupations as toastmasters in various feasts and banquets during weekends. Previously, her husband used to work in an entertainment centre; now he is an art director in a vocational school. \r\n\r\nThey have already taught the basics of their occupation to their middle son. Now he occasionally assists them during banquets. They enjoy doing their job because it provides an income and gives them a lot of free time during the week. Saving little by little, they have able to buy audio equipment and speakers. They understand to survive the competition they constantly have to seek ways to improve the quality of their services. Gulmira hopes to obtain a loan to buy a video camera as it has become essential to organize feasts and parties. In the near future, they plan to organize a band and buy sound equipment for their son so that he is able to work separately. \r\n\r\nGumira has three loan partners: Gulsaira, Zinagul and Maria. Gulsaira, 42, is a widow with two children. Since the collapse of Soviet Union she has been engaged in commerce near a hospital. Now she plans to sell foodstuffs at school. She needs a loan to purchase goods and foodstuffs in order to increase turnover. With the return, she would pay for her daughter\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nZinagul, 44, is a mother of five children. Besides being a housewife, she helps her husband raise the livestock. Zinagul needs a loan to buy a milk cow in order to sell milk.\r\n\r\nMaria, 50, is married and has six children. Her husband and son raise cattle while she manufactures traditional articles. In her spare time, she helps her husband look after cattle. Maria wants to obtain a loan to open up a shop as there are few of them in the area.\r\n \r\n  ======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

With the loan, he will buy some goats and resell them at a good profit. Hussainia knows that her brother-in-law has been doing this business for many years and he has good experience in this field so he will utilize the loan money in a positive manner and improve his business conditions. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application. In the previous loan year, she has built a good credit behavior and attended every meeting. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is Hussainia.

Mar\u00eda says that this is a painful situation as she struggles to raise her two small daughters by herself. Alexis sends money from his job every month. He emigrated to Spain in search of work since there were few job opportunities in Paraguay and he was forced to take extreme measures to get ahead.<p>\r\nWith the money her husband sent, Mar\u00eda set up a general store in her house. In this way she generates extra income without having to leave home and without neglecting her children, who are still small.<p>\r\nSince the income from the store is good, Mar\u00eda would like to invest more into it and for this reason, she is asking for a loan with which to buy a greater quantity and variety of merchandise, such as: handbags, candles, wallets, toys, shoes, jewelry, cushions, vases, sheets, and other things that her customers have requested on various occasions.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Z. de 28 a\u00f1os de edad esta casada hace 8 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Alexis G\u00f3mez de 36 a\u00f1os, el matrimonio tiene dos hijos, uno de 6 a\u00f1os que ya va a al 1er. grado en una escuela de la ciudad y el otro m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o de 1 a\u00f1o.<p> \r\nHace 4 a\u00f1os Alexis est\u00e1 trabajando en Espa\u00f1a, y viene  una vez al a\u00f1o a visitar a su familia, Mar\u00eda cuenta que es muy dolorosa esta situaci\u00f3n, pues ella sola debe luchar con sus hijas peque\u00f1as para salir adelante.

She is 42 years old and is one of 8 members of the Santa Rosa D. Yanacoto group comprised of members that engage in various types of work. Carmen began selling AVON products (beauty products such as perfume, talcum powder and cologne). It took approximately 1 year for her to gain customers, during which time her income improved, and needing to buy products to sell, she had the opportunity to participate for the first time in Edaprospo, through a friend. She invested her first loan in buying more AVON products. She now sells food, sweets and sodas at a place she rented in a College of Education. Like with all business, she started with small quantities of merchandise, but her income soon improved due to regular sales.  This current loan will be invested in the purchasing of merchandise: 3 cases of soda, boxes of cookies, candy, gum, sausages and boxes of yogurt.  She has in mind plans to open a restaurant in an area where the public passes by and of course to offer a better life to her children.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jacqueline Demeranville, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":545864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 3 cases of soda, cookies, candy, sausages and yogurt ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-06-12T07:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bonifacia  Freforia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benito Oswaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2582.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617163},{"amount":450,"local_amount":1275,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1291.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831498},{"amount":450,"local_amount":1275,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1291.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098039}],"funded_date":"2010-07-05T15:38:34Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacqueline Demeranville","image":1016015}},{"id":207744,"name":"Khursheed's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khursheed is very supportive of her family.

She earns her living by operating a general store and buying and selling dried fish. Her common-law husband Vergelio, who is 49 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  She has three children who are between 23 and 32 years old. Marieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Marieta is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

Being an entrepreneur at a relatively young age, Katlyn strives to do her best to improve her business and to provide for her two children who depend on her. One of her children is studying in elementary school, and the younger one is not yet of school age. Katlyn lives with them in Munting Ilog, Silang, Cavite.\r\n\r\nKatlyn runs her own sari-sari (variety) store seling to people in her community.  She is able to balance both being an entrepreneur and a single mom. She also manages to attend weekly fellowships and trainings in CCT* as a community partner. Through her sari-sari store, Katlyn is able to serve her community by meeting their needs with quality and affordable products. Every month she earns around Php 7,000.\r\n\r\nBecause she is in need of help to empower her in sustaining her business, Katlyn decides to seek a loan Php10,000. She plans to use this loan to purchase quality brands for her store. She intends to buy sacks of rice, boxes of canned goods, instant noodles, and soft drinks which are sought after by customers in the hot weather of the country. Katlyn acknowledges that this loan will greatly help her in sustaining not just her business but also her family.\r\n\r\nLike many micro entrepreneurs, Katlyn struggles with customers who do not pay their debt. But because her goal is to grow and become sustainable, she works on ways to handle this difficulty.

Vahshad region. He is 22 years old and despite a young age has six years experience in the animal husbandry. He buys young calves, feeds them and then resells on the market. All this process takes about 50 days. This business provides good income, and at this time due to winter the prices for cattle have fallen and he wants to get a loan to buy calves at a cheaper price. In the spring he will be able to sell them and make profit. He will pay off the loan within 12 months.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

Leonida's name is the official name of this borrowing group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Leonida owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling breads, cakes, and cookies to members of the local community. Leonida has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leonida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services. She wanted to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Leonida has successfully repaid a previous loan  from ASKI. Leonida is now requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make her baked products for sale. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Leonida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 46 years old and married with two school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling pork meat in the local community. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Josephine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her fifth loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Estefania, Amulung, Cagayan. He is 43 years old. Ariel is married and has eight school-aged children. To earn an income for his family needs, he engages in a transportation business operating a motorcycle. Being in the business for 5 years, Ariel already has many customers thus making him earn at least 4000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ariel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ariel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to repair his existing vehicle for better service. Ariel is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tires and other accessories. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Ariel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a married woman and has 3 children who are between 5 and 10 years old. They live southwest of the city where she has a business selling varied merchandise, such as clothing for women and men, shoes and accessories.

Her main customers live around the neighborhood and also are employed by various companies.\r\n\r\nHellen\u2019s dream is to turn her business into a large distributor of products where people find whatever they need and she can sell it at wholesale, for people to resale every day, as she is doing today.\r\n\r\nAt this time she plans to take advantage of the holiday season at the end of the year to increase her sales and to earn much more income, because her customers have made requests to which she wants to respond but she does not have enough cash flow to do it. This is the reason for which she is asking for a Kiva loan, her first financial funding under the wing of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy Christmas decorations, party dresses,

However, the upcoming Christmas season opens the doors of hope. \r\n\r\nDue to the high demand for piglets (between zero and six months old) during this season, Sebastian needs 700 soles to finance the food for his piglets and sell them at a fair price for his investment. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":218392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Invest in pig food and sales to prepare for the Christmas season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2008-11-06T17:20:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebasti\u00e1n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-20T20:11:05Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-01T08:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9929358},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854216},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393101},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084850}],"funded_date":"2008-11-06T20:11:05Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T17:46:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":75826,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace A. is married and has 4 dependents.

Alice decided to work extra hard to assist her husband in bringing up these children, but along the way she encountered some challenges such as death and ill health. She saw GHAPE as an opportunity to assist her in improving her livelihood. She was trained and given a loan in 2004.\r\n \r\nThis will be Alice's fourth loan from GHAPE; she became a member in 2004. She has been quite successful in the past with her business due to her location (right on the main road), the quality of her products, and her reasonable prices.

She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan to buy tomatoes, spices, palm oil, piglets, and repair her old pig stye. She plans to use the profit from the loan to further her children's education in higher institutions of learning. This business of Alice's will help her community by supplying food to them and will also help those in her community to reduce their distance to the market to buy the type of goods she is selling.\r\n\r\nAlice prefers to receive a loan from GHAPE because the method of repayment is comfortable and convenient, and because of the social services and training GHAPE also offers.  \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

She lives with her two children, and is separated from her husband.  As a young woman, she studied cosmetology and at the end of her studies she got a spot in a beauty salon in the market in her city, where she has worked for 7 years.  Thanks to the great diversity of beauty products that she offers in the market, the people never stop coming to make purchases from her.  Gloria works every morning making combs and brushes, and she really enjoys this, above all during the end of the year because of the number of school parties that there are in the city, which generate a larger income.  But she doesn\u2019t enjoy doing haircuts for the men because they are not creative, as compared to the haircuts for the women.  She wants to install a beauty salon in her home and so stop paying rent for her location, money which she would invest in the ambiance of her own shop.  Gloria has been working with PRISMA for 7 years, time that has helped her reinforce her working capital and enter into friendships with the members of her group.

Having lacked the chance to attend school for societal reasons, she soon got introduced to income-generating work, notably buying and selling Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), bracelets, embroidered fabrics, bed sheets, necklaces for children, etc.  Massouko has been improving in her niche market for thirty years now.  \r\n<p>\r\nWanting to do better in satisfying her ever-growing customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso over six years ago.  After four solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her area (Association JIGUISSEME de Sanoubougou I), she is now on her seventh individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy 10 outfits of embroidered fabrics, 10 bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>, 60 bed sheets of different grades, and a hundred-some necklaces for children.  Supplies of goods are gotten in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso) and then are sold at home or door-to-door to customers composed generally of women, cash accepted and credit at times.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 200,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest

Adhiambo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Scholastica Adhiambo O. is a 32-year-old mother of two children, ages 11 and one, and is married to a businessman. Her family lives in Nyalenda slum in Kisumu. She sells new clothing, purchased from Kampala in the town center at Lake Market. On average, she sees four to five customers a day. She hopes to use the loan to purchase more clothes to stock her shop with.\r\n<p>\r\nScholastica's main challenge is a lack of customers because citizens here in Kisumu are facing hard economic times. Scholastica says August to September are the times when she sells the most clothes. She likes running her own business because she is able to do things herself and nobody controls her. When asked who makes better entrepreneurs, men or women, she says women. This is a common answer, even from the men here in Kisumu because, as Scholastica says, the women care more for the children.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Scholastica saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Scholastica responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

Aileen has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Aileen joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aileen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock to raise & sell in the future. Aileen is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Aileen from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Pelepesite has 3 years of experience in this business.  Pelepesite needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Pelepesite joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Pelepesite's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Pelepesite are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending

He is 35 years old, married, and has 3 children ages 14, 10 and 5.  All attend school.  He attended school through the 12th grade but did not continue due to a lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family, and supports his parents who live with him.  \r\n\r\nHe left Chokwe for the Boane district of Maputo when he was still very young. He attended school and grew up there, and still lives in this area.  He has worked for the security company G4S for more than 6 years.  He does not have any employees and receives a salary of 4.375.00 mt per month, which he uses for household expenses and saves a bit in his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe has never had loans in other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku thorugh work colleagues who are also Hluvuku customers.  This is his third loan, in the amount of 23.000.00mt which he will use to purchase construction material (porcelain bath fixtures, cement, etc.) to continue building his home.  The prior loans were for 9.000.00mt and 13.000.00mt for the same purpose.  He promises to pay this loan as agreed in order to have access to others.  In the future he plans to request more loans to continue his home improvements and to open a hair salon as a way to increase his family's income. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

She is 42 years old. Narcisa is the group leader of a 21-member group taking out a loan from ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Narcisa M.' Group.\r\n\r\nNarcisa is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Narcisa owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Narcisa is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Narcisa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Narcisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. Narcisa is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Narcisa from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":535281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products to sell in her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sta.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

There he manufactures sportswear such as sweatshirts, shorts, T-shirts, and other items.  Sergio started in this trade by working different jobs for a small business near his house.  In his free time, he also helped produce this type of clothing.  This is how he learned the art of sewing.  His employer encouraged him to pursue this business independently and now he has his own operation located in a basic structure.  Sergio currently dreams of acquiring industrial machines so that he will be more independent because he currently pays to have each garment produced.  His main challenge was being able to access funding from credit institutions, but now that is a thing of the past.\r\n<p>\r\nSergio is requesting a Kiva loan, which is his first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  This will enable him to build a credit history.  He will take advantage of this opportunity to buy fabrics and supplies wholesale so that he can get special discounts.  These materials will be used to manufacture sweaters and shorts in mass quantities so that he can generate a return on his investment.  Sergio sells his goods according to order.  He is able to compete in the marketplace due to the unmatched quality of his products.

As he said, adjusting to this \u201cnew country, new place, new work\u201d was an amazing process and a learning experience. Javier now owns a successful landscaping business in South Florida and has three employees.\r\n\r\nWith this loan from Accion USA, Javier will buy a new lawn mower and other equipment that needs to be replaced.

He's very much sought after by his clientele thanks to the quality of his products.\r\n\r\nTo meet an ever-increasing customer demand, he decided to join Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso, approximately one year ago. He has already obtained two loans, which were both repaid without problems.\r\n\r\nHe's seeking his third loan in order to buy 10 pairs of \"Ferardine\" shoes, 5 \"Abacos\" vests, 5 pairs of shoes, a dozen belts, 15 pairs of trousers of various quality, and 10 different shirts.\r\n\r\nHe gets his supplies in Bamako, and resell as a traveling salesman, for cash and on credit, in the various professional institutions in Sikasso, and often as far as Baguin\u00e9da, on the road to S\u00e9gou.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he foresees turning a monthly profit of XOF 200'000 (ca US$ 400), to be used mainly to help paying the family expenses and repay the loan. He will reinvest the remainder in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":921186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy 15 pairs shoes, 5 vests, a dozen belts, 15 pairs of trousers, and 10 shirts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-11-17T15:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boubacar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874364},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283186},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:23Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424694},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139961},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756938},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251714},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410756},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448937},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502710},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51124.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268390}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T18:10:16Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":363527,"name":"Katana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Katana is a married man with four school going children.

Like many men in this area, the husbands have all been fishing since they were boys.  Two of them, Mr. S. Math and Mr. S. Ousman, were fishing at the time of the loan interview.  They do not appear in this photograph.  They are requesting this, their first group loan from Maxima, to buy fishing nets, a second-hand motor for one boat and for general boat repair costs.\r\n<p>\r\n1- Mr. S. Tol (aged 45) and his wife (center couple in image) married in 1989.  They have six children, three of whom study in the village school.  One son fishes with his father.  His wife takes care of the children and household as well as sells the fish her husband catches.  They are saving to buy a car that they will then use as a taxi. They are requesting a loan from MAXIMA for US$300 and will use this money to buy fishing nets and a second-hand motor for his fishing boat.\r\n<p>\r\n2- Mr. S. Math (aged 39) and his wife (far right of image) married in 1990.  They have four children, two of whom study in the village school.  His wife sells green papaya salad at the afternoon market along the lane that runs through their village.  They are requesting a loan from MAXIMA for the first time for $US100 and will use this money to buy fishing nets.\r\n<p>\r\n3- Mr. S. Ousman (aged 44) and his wife (far left of image) married in 1986.  They have six children, two of whom study in school, two of whom have stopped studying and two of whom are physically disabled.  His wife describes the disability as \u201ctheir arms and legs don\u2019t work\u201d.

She makes them with a colleague inside the shop she has installed on the second floor of her home. But in order to make these various items she has to buy a variety of materials. So she leaves early in the morning to the metal stores to acquire what is needed and in this whay when they arrive at her shop she busies herself in designing large quantities, which later will be sold in various places in the jungle where Diola usually travels.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their business equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, which enables them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":290585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy lumber for making furniture.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valeria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613673},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010752},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233038},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664829},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105541}],"funded_date":"2009-04-01T12:24:22Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":100418,"name":"Lona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lona I.  is currently in the business of selling fish and onions and is requesting a loan to open up a shop.

She is 27 years old. Zisa Belen is married and has an infant. To make a living, Zisa Belen owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling specialty products in the local community. Zisa Belen has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 1,500 PHP per month for these activities.\n\nIn 2011, Zisa Belen joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Zisa Belen is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase hair pins, combs, celphone accessories, bracelets and other products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Zisa Belen from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has lived with  Cesar, her husband, for 20 years. They both have 4 children. but they only live with 3 of them in their house located in the community of Cayan. Hard work is her motto, and America puts a lot of effort into her farmland. For 10 years she has planted potatoes, peas and olluco on her own land. After fertilizing, she sells them in the wholesale market of the city of Tarma. According to her, what she thinks is the most difficult thing is transporting her product, since the sacks are very heavy and they tire her out a lot. She plants twice a year and what she likes the most is harvesting, since the buyers themselves go to her land, and thus she avoids having to transport to the market. She also raises Holstein cows, which are dairy cows. She makes cheese with the milk they produce. Every weekend she receives earnings, since she sells 4 cheese molds to a dairy product merchant. She also has 3 pig that she is raising to sell for meat. Now she is planning on planting 20 sacks of potatoes for this season. Her dream for the future is to buy new land to increase her crops. She belongs to the \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d community bank and this is her ninth loan with MFP, where she hopes that your support for her work will continue.

She became a member and obtained a loan to grow her business. Her business grew to a new level and she applied for other loans.
