Beatrice hopes that in the future she will be able to add more money to the business. \r\n\r\nBeatrice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Norah is 18 years old and lives in the town of Hima in the Fortportal region of Uganda. For the past 11 months, Norah has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells maize, rice and coffee. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Norah has requested a loan of 600000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to look after the family and add more commodities in the shop to be sold to her clients at a good price. This will help Norah to generate greater profits and enlarge the business. Norah hopes that in the future she will be able to add to the business. \r\n\r\nNorah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

The 23 of them, 17 women and 6 men, are farmers in Kakamega South District. Farming inputs will be delivered to Judith on credit, consisting of the necessary materials to plant \u00bd acre of maize, millet and sorghum. Judith first enrolled with One Acre Fund during the 2007 Long Rains and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. Judith joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and grow enough food for the family.\n\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Judith was only able to harvest 2 bags of maize per 1 acre, but last year, she was able to harvest 18 bags per 1 acre!

Mariam is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kaliro, in the Iganga region of Uganda. For the past three, Mariam has been working hard to manage her clothing sales business. She sells clothes for both children and adults. \n\nTo help expand her business, Mariam has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for sell, which will help Mariam to improve her standard of living and generate greater profits. Mariam hopes that in the future she will be able to boost the business. \n\nMariam is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1299463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

is 50 years old and lives in Pakwach, Uganda. He is married and has 6 children; with 5 of them currently in school. For the past 6 years, Anthony has been working hard to manage his stall, which sells flour. \n\nTo help expand his business, Anthony has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to improve on the business and buy more produce such as maize flour to sell. It will also help Anthony generate greater profits and help generate income. Anthony hopes that in the future he will be able to expand the business. \n\nAnthony is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

She is married to Juan Carlos and they have two young daughters, who are their reason for living.  Isabel is the owner of a dwelling built from adobe blocks where her family shares daily experiences. From a very young age her life has been tied to farming and, together with her family, she produces organic cacao. Since she became an adult she has had the responsibility of keeping her parcel of land under cultivation and of doing plantation maintenance where it is necessary to perform the tasks of weeding and pruning the trees in order to obtain quality cacao crops. In order to speed up the work involved, she wants to hire a local work force. Consequently she has approached Microfinanzas Prisma for a loan in order to have the necessary capital. \r\n\r\nIsabel has long range plans that include purchasing a vehicle to facilitate transport of her crops to the city, thus lowering her transport expenses. She currently needs S\/. 1,000 in order to hire workers and finish weeding her fields so that she can reap good cacao beans.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1306191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-05T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-04T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":106.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117.03},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":120.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":129.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":140.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.54,"local_amount":106.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":110.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869038},{"amount":46.81,"local_amount":117.03,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":121.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577879},{"amount":48.35,"local_amount":120.88,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":125.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530110},{"amount":99.26,"local_amount":248.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":257.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975141},{"amount":51.84,"local_amount":129.6,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:14Z","rounded_local_amount":134.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996409},{"amount":111.2,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:08Z","rounded_local_amount":288.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352318}],"funded_date":"2013-03-08T19:27:00Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":533948,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of two children, Delia works hard to support her family.

tranquila las personas son muy amables platican que en el mes de febrero hay un carnaval donde toda la gente se divierte al m\u00e1ximo algunas de ellas participan en dicho Carnaval. El nombre del grupo lo eligi\u00f3 Don Mateo porque una de sus hijas se llama Mar\u00eda Isabel y de cari\u00f1o le dicen Chabelita. Son personas muy trabajadoras pero sobretodo muy alegres.\n\nMar\u00eda Isabel, hija de Don Mateo tambi\u00e9n pertenece al grupo, platica que tiene 29 a\u00f1os en la actualidad vive en uni\u00f3n libre con el se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 Alejandro juntos han formado una familia con tres ni\u00f1os de los cuales van a la escuela. Isabel est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para comprar ropa nueva como pantal\u00f3n, su\u00e9teres, camisas, ropa para bebe, ropa para ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as etc. Isabel lleva ya tres a\u00f1os con la actividad la inicio porque quer\u00eda ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar. Isabel argumento \u201cMis ni\u00f1os eran muy peque\u00f1os y yo no pod\u00eda conseguir un empleo ya que no pod\u00eda dejar tanto tiempo a mis ni\u00f1os solos, as\u00ed que para m\u00ed fue m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil iniciar a vender ropa\u201d Isabel platica que solo inicio con $500 pesos ahora est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar m\u00e1s ropa la cual la compra en Toluca, para despu\u00e9s venderlas en las comunidades cercanas caminando, considera una muy buena manera de vender porque si puede tener m\u00e1s clientes, porque si solo se estableciera en un mismo lugar no tendr\u00eda las mismas ganancias como las que est\u00e1 teniendo actualmente. Isabel cuenta que su \u00fanica dificultad es cuando sus clientas se tardan mucho tiempo en pagarle y es cuando no salen muy bien sus ganancias pero de ah\u00ed en fuera nada grave, esto no la limita a tener grandes sue\u00f1os como el que sus hijos terminen una carrera profesional donde puedan realizarse y tener una mejor calidad de vida, tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda mejorar su vivienda para sentirse mas c\u00f3modos. Isabel y los integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy contentos y agradecidos con VisionFund y KIVA por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado porque al igual que Isabel ellos tambi\u00e9n podr\u00e1n invertir en sus actividades como Don Mateo invertir\u00e1 en su vulcanizadora, Ana Lilia invertir\u00e1 en ropa y finalmente Sebasti\u00e1n en material para construcci\u00f3n.\n","en":"The \u201cLas Chabelitas\u201d group is located in a calm community with very friendly people. They say that in the month of February, there is a carnival in which everyone has a lot of fun. Some of them participate in this carnival. Mateo chose the name of the group, because one of his daughters is named Mar\u00eda Isabel and they affectionately call her Chabelita. The members are very hardworking people, but above all they are very happy.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel, Mateo's daughter, also belongs to the group. She is 28 years old and lives in a common law marriage with Jos\u00e9 Alejandro. Together they have started a family with their three children, who go to school. Isabel has applied for this loan to buy new clothing, such as pants, sweaters, shirts, clothing for babies and children, etc. She has already been in this business for three years, because she wanted to help her husband with their household expenses. Isabel says, \"My children were very young and I was unable to work because I couldn't leave them alone for a long time, so it was easier for me to start selling clothing.\" Isabel says that she started her business with only 500 pesos.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for this loan to buy more clothing in Toluca, which she will then sell by walking around the surrounding communities. She considers this a very good way to make sales because she can have more clients. If she only established herself in one place, she would not have the same income that she currently has. Isabel says that her only difficulty arises when her clients take a long time to pay her, and when her income is not very good. However, this has not been serious and it has not kept her from having big dreams, such as her children finishing a professional degree so that they can fulfill themselves and have a better quality of life. She would also like to make improvements to her home so that the family is more comfortable.\r\n\r\nIsabel and the group members are very happy and grateful to VisionFund and Kiva for this loan. Like Isabel, they will be able to invest in their businesses.

Neliberta, 48, is a very smiling person. She has been married to Alejandro for 29 years. Together they have made a family with their four children, who are studying. \r\n\r\nNeliberta has been raising oxen and pigs for two years. She started this business because she wanted to help her husband with their home expenses and their children's school expenses. She had also noticed, since she was a young girl, that the majority of people in her community had animals to sell. Neliberta has applied for another loan from this institution to buy more feed for the pigs and calves which she has at home. She says that she has not sold any of her animals, which is why she still has not earned an income, because she would like to raise many animals in order to sell them when she really needs the money.\r\n\r\nShe is very pleased because thanks to her previous loan, the number of pigs and oxen she owns has increased little by little.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nTamar requested a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tamar will buy clothing and dishes to sell. Tamar plans to buy at wholesale prices and then resell at a higher price. This will increase the income of the family and she will improve living conditions for her children. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1305397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy clothing and dishes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Saeliao","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-05T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-04T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.69},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":94.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":96.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.65,"local_amount":76.24,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":78.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861459},{"amount":44.78,"local_amount":71.64,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":74.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570294},{"amount":46.68,"local_amount":74.69,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":77.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968927},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":76.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":78.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749345},{"amount":49.49,"local_amount":79.17,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":81.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613251},{"amount":50.56,"local_amount":80.91,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":83.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856975},{"amount":52.13,"local_amount":83.4,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":86.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133633},{"amount":54.01,"local_amount":86.42,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":89.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107233},{"amount":232.12,"local_amount":371.39,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":384.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254804}],"funded_date":"2013-03-08T19:38:24Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T10:25:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":534039,"name":"Mary Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Ann is 29 years old and married with one daughter.

This is the only source of income for the family and it is hardly enough to pay for their food. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nEkaterine has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d on account of their low incomes. With the loan, Ekaterine will start a clothing business. She plans to purchase clothing in Turkey at wholesale prices and then resell the clothes to her neighbors at higher prices. This will increase the family's income. The new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, could significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1305425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start a retail clothing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tbilisi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-05T23:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-04T23:00:06Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ekaterine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":63.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":61.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":63.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":64.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":66.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":68.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":70.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":72.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":74.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":76.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.47,"local_amount":63.47,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":63.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861460},{"amount":58.15,"local_amount":58.15,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":58.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570295},{"amount":60.34,"local_amount":60.34,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":60.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968928},{"amount":61.39,"local_amount":61.39,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":61.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749346},{"amount":63.56,"local_amount":63.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":63.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613252},{"amount":64.81,"local_amount":64.81,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":64.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856976},{"amount":66.58,"local_amount":66.58,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":66.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133634},{"amount":68.72,"local_amount":68.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":68.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107234},{"amount":70.28,"local_amount":70.28,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":70.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254805},{"amount":222.7,"local_amount":222.7,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":222.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440018972}],"funded_date":"2013-03-09T01:45:54Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:41:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joy Adams","image":1247614}},{"id":534029,"name":"Miguela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Miguela.

Her long-term plans are to build her home with good-quality materials, which she hopes will improve her quality of life and that of her young son.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1306294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-05T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-04T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":106.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117.03},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":120.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":129.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":140.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.54,"local_amount":106.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":110.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869043},{"amount":46.81,"local_amount":117.03,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":121.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577884},{"amount":48.35,"local_amount":120.88,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":125.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530115},{"amount":99.26,"local_amount":248.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":257.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975146},{"amount":51.84,"local_amount":129.6,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":134.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996413},{"amount":111.2,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":288.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352322}],"funded_date":"2013-03-06T03:00:33Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":534577,"name":"Maira Marisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maira, est\u00e1 solicitando un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo, para continuar invirtiendo aun mas en el negocio, se comprara ma\u00edz, sal, aceite, le\u00f1a, quesillo, repollo, gaseosas y otros productos que sean necesarios para que el negocio pueda seguir brindando un buen servicio.\nElla comenta que el pr\u00e9stamo anterior le permiti\u00f3 mejorar su condici\u00f3n, crecer y tener los materiales necesarios para trabajar, en su familia considera que su situaci\u00f3n ha mejorado teniendo m\u00e1s ingresos. \n","en":"Maira is seeking a new loan so that she can continue to invest in her business.

Do\u00f1a Lucy es una mujer muy entusiasta, alegre pero sobretodo muy trabajadora ella se dedica a la crianza de cerdos, bueyes, pollos, guajolotes y patos desde hace 22 a\u00f1os justo cuando se caso con el se\u00f1or  Margarito.

They chose this name because they meet in Lucia's house, and she has a corn mill, which is why they thought of naming their group this way.\r\n\r\nLucy, as she is affectionately called, is 42 and has been married to Margarito for 22 years. Together they formed a family with five children. Only one of their daughters is still studying and therefore dependent on them; the other four children are already independent. Lucy is a very enthusiastic and happy woman, but above all she is very hardworking. \r\n\r\nShe has made a living raising pigs, oxen, chickens, turkeys, and ducks for 22 years, since she married Margarito. Lucy says that she started this business because she wanted to help her husband with their household costs. She became even more motivated when the institution offered her a loan, which they said was to invest in her animals. Now she is applying for a loan to buy more pigs and calves. \r\n\r\nShe says that she doesn't have any difficulties in her work, because she already has plenty of experience with the animals. She has received two training sessions about raising animals, one from the institution and one from the government. Lucy said: \"I like my work very much because I can see how the mothers give birth to their baby animals. Once we had a sheep who gave us twins, but she wasn't able to give birth to them and we had to help her with the techniques we learned in the training.\" \r\n\r\nLucy is very happy and grateful to VisionFund because thanks to the loans, she has been able to invest in her animals. With her earnings, she has been able to finish building her house. Her house only had two rooms, but now it has four rooms and a small living room.

His wife, after completing the housework, heads over to the store to help with the orders and assist customers.  \r\n\r\nHis desire to start a store came from experiences in his childhood, as his parents sent him to spend holidays with his cousins family and they had a grocery store.

Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has two milk cows. Irma and her mother-in-law milk them every day to make dairy products. They also own a vineyard and an agricultural plot of land where maize is grown. Vladimer cultivates the land and harvests the grapes himself. The family has been in this business already for 15 years. All the produce is sold locally at Zestafoni markets and they have a small monthly income which is not enough to feed six family members . According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma requested loan from Credo to start up the family business which was stopped recently, because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Irma will open a Georgian bread bakery. She will rent a place and seeing as using wood for fire will be more expensive, she will install gas pipes. Irma\u2019s husband is a baker and he will be baking the bread himself.

The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-start up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the loan, Khatia will rent a trading counter at the local market in the Tkibuli district, purchase clothes at wholesale price, and then sell them for retail price. Khatia will use the profits to reinvest in the same business. This new business initiative, financed by the Kiva start-up loan, will help this young girl start her own business and improve the living conditions of her family.

We proudly follow the traditions, incorporating contemporary teachings and designs to face new challenges. Our creations are totally handmade with love and quality. For us, embossing leather is a family tradition. My father inherited it from his father, and handed it down to us. When he was very young, my father learned to work with leather, making saddles primarily for fine Peruvian paso horses. Later he established a small workshop, where he achieved such a perfection that soon his products, totally handmade, gained great acceptance and prestige.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to give you all a big hug for supporting our work.

Su capital de trabajo para comprar maquinarias que satisfagan el requerimiento de su mercado, no es suficiente y esta es la raz\u00f3n para acudir a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 3 lavadoras y algunas mercanc\u00edas que requiere para cumplir con pedidos. Su credikiva proyecta ser exitoso porque lo realiza en el marco de su experiencia de mercado y para responder oportunamente a su clientela que muchas veces se va de su negocio sin obtener respuesta al servicio. Su mayor desaf\u00edo consiste en lograr ahorrar lo suficiente para alg\u00fan d\u00eda tener su propia casa y genera aun mucho mas bienestar a su familia. \n\n","en":"Mariela lives with her husband and two daughters who are 2 and 13 years old. She lives in the south west part of the city, where she has a shop which offers washing machine rental services. She has also acquired various goods to sell to clients who initially come in to the shop for rental services. \r\n\r\nShe has been providing services and selling goods for 4 years, since her shop first opened. Looking to generate income to support her household, mainly for her children's expenses, she set up her business and managed to keep it going over the years. Her strong work ethic - she works 13 hours a day, everyday of the week - has enabled her to move forward with her business and create new ways of buying and selling, taking every opportunity to respond to the demands of a client base that is continually growing. \r\n\r\nShe doesn't have enough money to buy all the machinery she needs to satisfy client demand, which is why she is requesting a Kiva loan. It is her first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy 3 washing machines and other goods that she requires to fulfill her orders. \r\n\r\nShe expects the Kiva loan to be successful because it will be used in the context of her business where she has ample experience and because she will be able to satisfy her clients who many times have had to leave empty-handed because she cannot keep up with demand. \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is to save up enough money to be able to buy her own house one day and to be able to improve her family's well-being.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1307040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery

This work allows her to generate enough income to maintain her household as she is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the health and credit training classes. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":1307063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-03-06T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-05T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genova\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melissa Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leydy Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelia Zenobia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arminda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23232.32,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2598.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2947.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2947.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2947.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2947.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2947.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2947.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2949}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":377.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":428.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":377.55,"local_amount":2598.92,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2608.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625411},{"amount":428.17,"local_amount":2947.4,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2958.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021368},{"amount":428.18,"local_amount":2947.4,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2958.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809176},{"amount":428.17,"local_amount":2947.4,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2958.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669246},{"amount":856.35,"local_amount":5894.8,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915012},{"amount":428.17,"local_amount":2947.4,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2958.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197651},{"amount":428.41,"local_amount":2949,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2960.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153425}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T07:53:21Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T11:14:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":534313,"name":"Bita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bita is 54 years old.

She is married to Michael and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nIrenea operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 12,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nIrenea hopes that her variety store will become a grocery store and dreams of having more customers.

He started this job in 2004 after failing to find formal employment and yet he had to meet the growing needs of his family. Abudu mainly deals in town service transportation.\r\n\r\nAbudu\u2019s dream is to have his own taxi so that he will be able to earn higher income such that he can provide the best for his family and also start up small businesses for his late brothers\u2019 wives.\r\n\r\nHis major challenge is working for people who do not pay him well which makes it hard for him to adequately meet his family needs.

goal in life is to give her children a better way of living and to send them to school to finish their college education. \r\n\r\nLucila is in her forties. She is married and blessed with four children. She is sending two of her children to school. They are in college and elementary school. Her two oldest children already finished their college. Lucila\u2019s husband is farmer and a tricycle operator as well.\r\n\r\nLucila has run her sari-sari store business for 14 years.

Eighteen years ago, she began making handicrafts and leather goods, a profession she started learning when she took a weaving class at a religious school when she was 10.

People began to take notice of her merchandise, and over time she bought equipment for her house, including an over-stitch machine. Her friends recommended her, and she has built a market that supports her. \r\n\r\nCarmen makes a variety of artesania, leather goods, painted frames, mulit-use items, underwear,  biscuits, and even special foods in her workshop. She sells for cash and also offers credit terms of one month.

She is applying for her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy leather, acrylic boards, steel knives, a millstone, grinders, glues, fittings, hemp, and frames.

Shafoat got married after finishing a secondary school.  Not having pursued a higher education, she was left without any type of profession.  She started having issues with money after giving birth to her children.  Her husband was involved in farming, but his income was barely enough for living.  Shafoat became involved in farming after the children grew up.  Currently, she needs more money than ever before because her children grew up and have to get married.  With the goal of obtaining a new source of income, she decided to start her own business in animal husbandry.  She completed the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained a certificate.  Shafoat came to IMON to obtain a loan in the amount of 2500 somoni to buy livestock.  She awaits your kindness because her family budget and children's future depend on this new business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1305854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy livestock and start a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-03-06T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-05T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shafoat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.11,"local_amount":0.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":0.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510314},{"amount":549.89,"local_amount":2499.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2614.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915601}],"funded_date":"2013-03-06T23:29:52Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":534366,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is 49 years old, married, with one child.

Thanks to Rakhiyabu's persistent work, she was able to grow her business to have two dairy cows and twenty sheep, and yield about 8,000 som from sales of milk and dairy products and reselling livestock.  In order to further develop her business, Rakhiyabu requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a year-old calf for fattening up because this year's prices are low, but expected to rise.
