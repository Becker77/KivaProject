Single and without children, Issouf lives in a traditional family in Tagouasso - Kadiolo (in the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nIssouf excels in the buying and selling of electronics such as mobile phones and their accessories. He has a booth so that he can properly conduct his business. Issouf's experience has earned him a good reputation in his field and he receives a large number of orders. In order to purchase the supplies to satisfy the demand of his customers, Issouf has begun working with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He is on his first loan cycle.\r\n\r\nThis loan will enable Issouf to buy a dozen mobile phones, as well as face plates and pre-paid phone cards. He purchases his supplies in Bamako and retails his merchandise for cash at his shop in Loulouni. His clientele is composed of both men and women.

","en":"Toktokan is 58 years old and a widow. In search of a source of income for her family, Toktokan started her business of livestock breeding and field crop cultivation in 1996, with a starting sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Toktokan's persistent work, her business with livestock today brings in around 9,500 som (KGS) in monthly income. Currently she owns 2.4 hectares of land, 3 heads of cattle and 20 sheep and goats. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Toktokan turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of livestock and for fodder.

For the past 4 years, John  has been working hard to manage his bar, which sells soft drinks and alcohol. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, John  has requested a loan of 2000000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more drinks such as beer, wine and spirits to sell. This will help John generate greater profits which will help generate income. John hopes that in the future he will be able to continue to improve the business. \r\n\r\nJohn is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like John who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1306123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She also has a commercial space at the local market that she is renting out. Additionally, the family is persecuted, so they get a monthly income from the government. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.  <p>\r\n\r\nGulsunda requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. With the received credit Gulsunda wants to rent a small place in the center of the city to open a shop where she will sell souvenirs and other such products. She will buy at wholesale prices and sell with price markups. This will increase her monthly profit. Gulsunda will use part of the profit to develop her business and another part to provide better living conditions for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1306145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Souvenir Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to rent a shop to sell souvenirs and other such products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Senaki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-07T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-06T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulsunda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":104.58},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111.32},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":113.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":117.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.43},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":122.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":129.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":136.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":144.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.58,"local_amount":104.58,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570306},{"amount":111.32,"local_amount":111.32,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":111.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968940},{"amount":113.13,"local_amount":113.13,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":113.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749358},{"amount":117.26,"local_amount":117.26,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":117.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613264},{"amount":119.43,"local_amount":119.43,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":119.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856987},{"amount":934.28,"local_amount":934.28,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":934.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133645}],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T18:32:11Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:04:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":534494,"name":"Ratha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ratha is a 49-year-old housewife; her husband is a truck driver.

Mr. Abou gets his supplies from market wholesalers prior to selling them at retail.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. Abou expects to turn a monthly profit of 100,000 CFA francs, which will be used to contribute to the family expenses and to pay the interest on his loan; the rest will be invested in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1306884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase assorted goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougoula Hameau ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-03-07T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-06T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922997},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636553},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030042},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819542},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678435},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924085},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207312},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419971983},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624652},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":40173.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850689}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T18:36:50Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessalyn Pinneo","image":603028}},{"id":534515,"name":"Sulai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sulai is 42 years old and lives in the town of Namutumba in the Iganga region of Uganda.

She has been doing this work for eight years, at one of the markets in her town. Her goal with this loan is to invest in working capital and to stock her clothing business. Leydy's work routine is to work ten hours a day so that some day in the not-too-distant future she can obtain better income. Leydy is grateful for the help that Kiva lenders are offering to people with scarce resources in poor countries like Nicaragua, so that they can work with

Her crops are marketed and sold on a small scale in the local market and to some buyers who come to the place where she lives from other nearby regions.\r\n\r\nSandra is currently requesting help to purchase supplies like fumigation pumps and natural fertilizers to help keep her crops healthy and free of diseases like coffee rust and other infestations that deteriorate the entire crop.\r\n\r\nHer goals and her dreams are to be able to continue giving her children a better education, as this will be the weapon that they can use to defend themselves against the challenges of life; to be able to keep moving forward so that each of them can achieve their dreams and goals; and to pass on the best teachings of all: respect for God, education, and the principles that are the basis for success in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1307192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase supplies like fumigation pumps and natural fertilizer for her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"concepci\u00f3n, santa barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-03-07T07:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:01Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Marixa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":12667.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530535520},{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12667.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542499072}],"funded_date":"2013-03-08T18:47:43Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":534616,"name":"Junalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Junalyn; she is 29-years-old and a resident of Silang, Cavite Philippines.

Married and the father of 5 children, he lives in a nuclear family in Kadiolo - Noumousso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). He has been buying and selling plastic shoes for over 6 years. His experience in this line of work has earned him a good reputation and he gets orders from everywhere. He is therefore asking for support from the microfinance institution Soro Wiriwaso in order to have the resources necessary to satisfy his customers, and is on his first loan. This loan will enable him to buy 600 pairs of plastic shoes. He gets his supplies from the Republic of the Ivory Coast, a country bordering Mali. When the shoes get to Mali, he sells them at the markets of Kadiolo and Loulouni, for cash and often credit, to a client\u00e8le made up of men and women. Thanks to this loan, he expects to make an average monthly profit of 105 000 francs. Part of the profit will allow him to cover the interest payments on his loan, and part will be reinvested in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1306917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy plastic shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kadiolo ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-03-07T12:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-06T12:00:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamadou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":58585.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636557},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":58585.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819546},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":58585.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924089},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":58585.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419971985},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":58585.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850691},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":58585.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459219877}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T02:55:26Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:35:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":534638,"name":"Reymoor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Reymoor is 31 years old and single.

Married and the father of 2 children, he lives in a nuclear family in Noumousso, Kadiolo (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). He has been buying and selling cereals and food products for 6 years. His experience in this line of work has earned him a good reputation and he receives orders for cereals, particularly corn. He therefore decided to work with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to have the resources necessary to satisfy his customers, and is on his 7th loan cycle. The previous loans have been correctly reimbursed.\r\n\r\nThis loan will enable him to buy 5 tons of corn and one ton of groundnuts. He gets his supplies from the neighbouring villages in Kadiolo, and stores the products in his shop. He sells them for cash to a client\u00e8le made up of men and women from Sikasso and Bamako. Thanks to this loan, he expects to make an average monthly profit of 110 000 francs. Part of the profit will allow him to cover the interest payments on his loan, and part will be reinvested in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1306930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy 5 tons of corn and one ton of groundnuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kadiolo ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-03-07T12:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-06T12:40:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lassine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100432.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355923001},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":100432.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636559},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100432.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030046},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":100432.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819548},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100432.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678439}],"funded_date":"2013-03-10T14:30:51Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":534644,"name":"Leonila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonila is a married mother of three, who works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business which sells purified drinking water in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from motorcycle transportation.

She is a very friendly, hard working and enthusiastic person who strives to provide for her children since she is both their mother and father. Unfortunately, because of  a lack of financial resources and because she has had to work since she was very young, Rosa was not able to go to school to become a cosmetologist, something that she would have very much liked to do. In her free time, she likes to listen to music and sometimes she likes to spoil her children by making a delicious dish of carapulcra.\r\nOn her own initiative and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Rosa has a small business selling fruit. She sells different fruits depending on the season and works about 8 hours every day. Rosa thinks that things are going well because she offers affordable prices and friendly customer service.\r\nRosa is very grateful for the Kiva micro loans as they have helped her to buy larger quantities and different varieties of fruit such as mangoes, apples, grapes, etc.  She has also been able to stock her business and serve her customers better and therefore, continue working and striving for her biggest dream, owning her own home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1307315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"purchase fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-07T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-06T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Albina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":72.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":74.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":80.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":84.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":87.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":95.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.54,"local_amount":67.79,"processed_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776489},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":68.44,"processed_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":72.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483323},{"amount":29.33,"local_amount":72.2,"processed_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":76.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889360},{"amount":61.92,"local_amount":152.43,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":160.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775559},{"amount":32.79,"local_amount":80.68,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":85.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778999},{"amount":34.14,"local_amount":84.05,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":88.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054189},{"amount":35.73,"local_amount":87.94,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":92.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819115},{"amount":37.06,"local_amount":91.24,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472099},{"amount":38.69,"local_amount":95.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":100.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694619}],"funded_date":"2013-03-08T01:42:20Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":534758,"name":"Benedicta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benedicta is a 42-year-old married woman from San Miguel, Bohol.

her main reason for living.  She is very friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic.  She dedicates all of her efforts to the progress of her son, since she is his mother and father.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, she wasn't able to study her desired career, law, due to a lack of financial resources and having to work.  She would have liked very much to have studied.  In her free time, she likes to listen to music and sometimes she cooks a delicious dish, ceviche, to share with her family.\r\n\r\nDue to her own initiative, great effort, and dedication, Katherine works at a small business selling groceries.  She works every day for about 10 hours and she believes that it is going well for her due to the good prices she offers and the friendly service that she offers her customers.\r\n\r\nKatherine is very grateful for Kiva loans, since thanks to the help offered, she will be able to buy a display case and groceries such as rice, sugar, milk, soups, drinks, etc.  In this way, Katherine will better stock her business and will be able to have more customers.  In this way, she will continue working and striving to accomplish her biggest dream of having her own house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1307312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"buy a display case and groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUARAZ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-07T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-06T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katherine Maryuri Vanes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":140.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":138.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":145.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":149.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":156.78},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":161.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":180.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":188.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":194.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":202.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.35,"local_amount":140.26,"processed_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":141.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776488},{"amount":53.52,"local_amount":138.11,"processed_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":138.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483322},{"amount":56.45,"local_amount":145.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":146.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889359},{"amount":57.8,"local_amount":149.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":149.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664261},{"amount":123.16,"local_amount":317.83,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":319.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775557},{"amount":429.72,"local_amount":1108.97,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778998}],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T19:02:49Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":534776,"name":"Remedios","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remedios is a responsible mother who lives at Solana, with her spouse and three school-aged children.

Maura farms for a living, growing vegetables such as rue, oregano, and chamomile, which are plants that do not need much tending, investment, or time.  \r\n\r\nShe says that her business is constant, as every time her crops get big, she cuts them, ties them in small bundles, and sells them for 50 cents each.  She also tells us that growing this kind of plant is simpler because when they grow, you can cut them and they grown back, so you do not have to spend money on fertilizers and labor, among other things that were a constant concern for her in years past.  Furthermore, the profits she makes are worthwhile because she has reliable customers in the city of Lima, where she sells three bundles of rue or chamomile for 2 soles, which is double the price in Tarma.  This will be Maura's second loan with Kiva, whom she thanks for placing its trust in her.  She promises to make her payments on time.

In 2005, she and her husband started their own business with 70,000 KGS.  Now, under her care, she has 13 head of sheep and 4 calves.  Fattening and selling cattle brings in 10,000 KGS a month for the family.  In order to further expand her business, Zoya has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy cattle and 25 sheep.

Regrettably, due to lack of financial resource and the need to work at a very young age, Dora was not able to go to school and become a professional, something which she would have very much liked to do.  In her spare time she likes to prepare various soups and stews to share with her family.\r\nWith a lot of determination, dedication and thanks to the support of her brothers, Dora works her small field where she grows yucca.  She works about 7 hours every day and believes that she is doing well given her responsibilities and experience.\r\nDora is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, through their help she will be able to purchase fertilizer and herbicides for her crops.  This way she plans to have a good harvest which she will be able to sell at a good price.  In this manner Dora will continue to work and strive to achieve her dream of owning a juicery and slowly getting ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1307708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer and herbicides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-08T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-07T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora Belen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3049.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695505}],"funded_date":"2013-03-10T14:08:59Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Bobbit","image":null}},{"id":535355,"name":"Julio Cesar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El sauce un peque\u00f1o municipio donde se ha caracterizado como una zona ganadera, es aqu\u00ed donde vive  Julio. \n\nJulio cuenta con su propia actividad ganadera, donde su principal actividad es la producci\u00f3n de leche, pero para esto el cliente necesita darle una buena alimentaci\u00f3n balanceada a su ganado  anud\u00e1ndole para sobre vivir en la \u00e9poca de verano, por condiciones de pasto no cuenta con una buena alimentaci\u00f3n. \n\nHoy en d\u00eda se entero que Ceprodel Y Kiva apoyaba a este tipo de persona, por tal Raz\u00f3n Solicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de: de pacas para la alimentaci\u00f3n de ganado ya que con esto ser\u00eda de mucha importancia para poder mantener la producci\u00f3n de leche y as\u00ed darle una mejor vida a sus tres hijitos que tanto ama y estima. \n\n Agradece Ceprodel y Kiva, para que estos le sigan dando la mano amigable para seguir adelante en su vida familiar. \n","en":"El Sauce, a small village in an area known for its cattle ranching, is where Julio lives.
