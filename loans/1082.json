It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAmiran requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Amiran will renovate four rooms on the second floor of their house.

Tereza hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nTereza  is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small-scale entrepreneurs like Tereza who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1306977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

She was born in a rural area which has good conditions for livestock and agriculture. \r\n\r\nFor several years, she has been engaged in raising crops. Her husband Odiljon helps her to run the business. Mainly, they grow barley. Last season, however, they did not get a good harvest.

","en":"Shohista is a kind and motivated woman. She is 25 years old. She is not married and lives with her parents. She was born in a rural area and has sufficient experience with raising livestock and crops. \r\n\r\nShe signed a contract with a dekhan farm land lease, where she will grow cotton. (In Tajikistan, \"dehkan farms\" are midsized peasant farms that are legally and physically distinct from household plots.)

Also he rents an automobile to local people who provide taxi services with it. He is requesting a loan of 6,500,000 MNT to purchase an automobile that runs on natural gas. A main advantage of a natural gas vehicle is that its emissions are cleaner: there are lower emissions of carbon and lower particulate emissions per equivalent distance traveled. Also it wastes less fuel. So purchasing this automobile is both beneficial to him and to the environment. Mr. Batjargal is a very hardworking individual who wants to improve his family's standard of living for his mother. His mother\u2019s only wish is to see her son living happily.

After the fall of the USSR and the collapse of its collective farms, Gulmira started her own business with livestock, with a start-up sum of 20,000 KGS.  She now has 2.5 hectares of land where she has a farmyard and where she also grows beans and perennial grasses.  She has a monthly income of 6,000 KGS from selling cattle and her crops.  In order to expand her business, Gulmira has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 KGS to buy sheep.

years old, married, and raising two children. Her older son is studying at university, and her daughter goes to school. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, Kadyira began in 1995 to engage in raising livestock and growing crops. Having started this business with three heifers for 9,000 KGS, through hard work Kadyira today has on her farm two cows, one calf, and a horse, which bring in a monthly profit of 12,000 som. Concluding that this business is profitable, Kadyira approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep for fattening and resale, and a cow to increase revenues through selling milk. \r\n\r\nKadyira plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her farm.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"When I was 13, in 1936, I went to work for a neighbor who crafted saddles. In 1954, I went to Lima in search of a better life. I saw a newspaper ad for a specialist to sew hemp by hand and was hired. The workshop crafted leather furniture, and, after a month, I took the place of the master craftsman when he retired. Today, my sons work with me. However, I've gone back to the traditional handmade techniques I learned at the beginning. I create the designs that once took us out of extreme poverty and opened a new path for us in this world.\r\n\r\nPlease receive a hug from across the miles as my way of thanking you for your selfless contribution to this microcredit loan.

This will provide them with more security and well-being so that Milagros can continue working and making an effort towards her dream of owning a furniture store.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1307895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase materials to plaster and paint her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-08T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-07T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160.97},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":176.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":180.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":189.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":194.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":202.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":212.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":218.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":228.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":235.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":245.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":255.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.78,"local_amount":160.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":162.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483334},{"amount":68.84,"local_amount":176.52,"processed_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":178.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889371},{"amount":70.35,"local_amount":180.39,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":182.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664271},{"amount":150.04,"local_amount":384.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":389.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775579},{"amount":220.88,"local_amount":566.37,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":573.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819124},{"amount":25.94,"local_amount":66.49,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472105},{"amount":89.01,"local_amount":228.21,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":230.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694625},{"amount":91.98,"local_amount":235.85,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":238.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450390703},{"amount":95.56,"local_amount":245.03,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":247.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067234},{"amount":99.62,"local_amount":255.44,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":258.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880179}],"funded_date":"2013-03-10T23:13:34Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:16:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":535015,"name":"Gordon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gordon is an artisan from Ghana who specializes in hand-carved African masks and sculptures.

She loves her family very much. Rosa is a very kind, hardworking, and enthusiastic person. She and her husband work extremely hard to help their family get ahead. Unfortunately, due to financial hardship, Rosa had to begin working at a young age, so she was not able to study Agronomy like she would have liked to. In her free time, Rosa likes to make clothing, and on special occasions she cooks the delicious Pachamanca (a traditional Peruvian dish) to share with her family. \r\n\r\nBy her own initiative and with much hard work and dedication, Rosa has a small business raising and selling birds such as ducks and chickens. She also works as a field hand.

A pulper\u00eda is a small store which sells edible goods in small quantities, such as shampoo and coffee packets, rice, beans, sugar, milk, eggs, tiste (a beverage made of cocoa powder and cornmeal), juice, and soft drinks. Rosa's routine is to work for about 12 hours per day offering her merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this loan is to invest in working capital so that in the not-so-distant future, she can earn a better income. Rosa Elena is grateful for the help which Kiva lenders give to people with limited resources in poor countries such as Nicaragua, so that they can have decent working conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1307179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He mostly grows tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes and grapes.  Vladimir's farm is large, and he does everything himself.  It's clear that he understands the value of money.  This winter, heavy snowfall caused one of his greenhouses to collapse and it now urgently needs to be restored.  Vladimir remembers the night it happened, he didn't sleep for fear the structures couldn't withstand the weight of the snow.  At first, everything was fine, but in the morning it became apparent that he was right.  Now he needs funds to rebuild it.  He plans to use 24,000 grivens from Kiva to prepare the greenhouse for spring and the beginning of the season.  Vladimir has a lot of free land.  With time, he plans to build several more greenhouses, and then to install a heat source in them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":1307114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to rebuild his greenhouse.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Velikaya Znamenka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.441667 34.345556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-03-08T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-07T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":2975,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vladimir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1487.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1487.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1487.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-27T08:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":12063.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589775},{"amount":1487.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":12063.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399834149}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T22:59:36Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T13:21:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Blake Griffin","image":1939381}},{"id":535072,"name":"Flor De \u00d1ustas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cFLOR DE \u00d1USTAS\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Copacabana, est\u00e1 compuesta por doce integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Amalia es la Presidenta.

She herself has been working as a chairman at one branch of a building company. Also she rents a 54-square-meter field to a cosmetic product selling company. The house the family lives in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. So she is requesting a loan of 2,600,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as fiberglass, bricks, concrete and planks. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable and warm place. In addition, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution by emitting less smoke. The borrower is a very hardworking and trustworthy individual who cares deeply for her

Galina has lived her whole life in Velikaya Znamenka, once working on a farm as a milkmaid, then in the cafeterias of state farms, and only began seriously farming her own land when she could find no more work.  She has turned to Kiva for financial assistance since during the growing season, she needed to install a boiler for heat which costed 17,000 grivens.

Due to this, they set up the business once again, which consists of selling fried plantains and cashew nuts. \r\n\r\nThey travel three times a week to the city's market, which is 20 kilometers from their home, to buy plantains, cashews, oil and plastic bags to store the nuts and the plantains. Regarding the nuts, they buy them in large quantities and store them, since they are a seasonal product and they have to store quite a lot in order to satisfy the demand throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from the Campo Foundation is to buy a greater quantity of cashews. Since Jos\u00e9's wife has been sick, they found themselves without cash to buy the nuts, although it is the production season for this crop. Thus, they need the money in order to buy a lot. Jos\u00e9 sells the nuts inside the local buses, and his wife sells at the bus stops.\r\n\r\nHis desire is to pay off all his debts, since he obtained a loan to build the house in which they currently live, and to have a quieter life, since he is a former military man.

Since 2009, Salamat has farmed and worked with livestock, having started her business with 20,000 KGS.  Today, under her stewardship, she has 10 sheep and 2.5 hectares of arable land where she grows beans.  The income from selling livestock and her vegetables is around 150,000 per year.  With the goal of further developing her business, Salamat has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 20,000 KGS to buy 5 sheep that she can fatten and sell.  She plans on using the income from the loan to improve her farm as well as to build a barn for the animals.

Her younger brother works in Turkey, on an employment contract, and he sends her financial aid each month.\r\n\r\nThe family's house has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. So, Zulbayar is requesting a loan of 6,500,000 MNT to purchase hardwood flooring, lumber, vacuum-insulated windows, cement, bricks and wallpaper. After the repairs financed by the loan, the family will live in a comfortable, warm place. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, thus contributing to Mongolia's efforts against air pollution by emitting less smoke. In addition, at this time of year the prices of building materials reach their lowest level. Purchasing them now will save a lot of money.

Otgonbaatar, 32 years old, lives with his family in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in a traditional Mongolian ger (portable felt dwelling) on his relative's yard. His wife works as a cook at a restaurant. Since 2011, he has been providing transportation services using his own truck between Ulaanbaatar and other cities. Before this business, he had been working as a driver at a private business. His son goes to elementary school and is in the fourth grade. Recently he purchased a second-hand natural gas vehicle that needs some parts updated and changed. Also, his home lacks some necessary daily-use appliances. He is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to cover the costs of purchasing home appliances such as a vacuum cleaner, a washing machine, and a sofa, as well as spare parts for his automobile. As a result, his family can live in a more comfortable place and he can work enthusiastically. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better

Now he works as a driver at a private business entity where also his wife works and holds the position of general manager. Using his previous loan from our organization, he completed building his rental house. Now he is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to install an electric heater and encase his house's roof with metals. Installing the electric heater will stop the usage of the furnace, in other words he will not burn coal as a fuel. Burning coal is considered to be main factor of air pollution in Ulaanbaatar according to survey. Also, fortifying the roof with metal will protect the house from strong storms and frosts, ensuring that the house will no longer lose its heat through the ceiling and roof. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who concerns greatly for his living environment and renters. If the area surrounding the house has poor air condition, it will not attract room-renters to his house.

She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their family's everyday needs.\r\n\r\nPrescilla maintains a direct-selling business. She sells different health products and apparel from Purple Networx. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with one month to pay. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and the difference provides the profits that dealers earn as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and residents of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Prescilla is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan to buy purple corn juice, optimum cleanse, optimum power, and different apparel as well as additional supplies and merchandise. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPrescilla hopes to expand her business and dreams that her youngest child will finish his studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She operates a food stall. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings when all of the family members are at home to eat. This is not only a case of tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for just one or two people when buying cooked dishes costs less than raw food.  \r\n\r\nFlorence has decided to remain single and she manages her own house while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue running her business, Florence is requesting a 25,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy more raw ingredients like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nFlorence dreams of helping her loved ones and other people. She hopes to be stronger in facing challenges in life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organised into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

For the past 5 years, Aidah has been working hard to manage her vegetable stall, where she sells vegetables. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Aidah has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase vegetables to sell, and will help Aidah to generate greater profits and increase the income level of the family. She hopes that in the future she will be able to be more productive. \r\n\r\nAidah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She lives in Chiatura District with her husband, Zurab, and two children who are going to school. Zoia requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family owns a small agricultural plot of land which Zurab cultivates and sows maize. The harvested product is sold locally at the market, and the family has a very small monthly income. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nZoia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Viola is 20 years old and lives in the town of Mangajo in the Luwero region of Uganda. She is married and has 2 children, with 1 of them currently in school. For the past 4 years, Viola has been working hard to manage her business, which sells mobile phone accessories. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Viola has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more phone accessories such as phone chargers to sell, and will help Viola to generate greater profits and earn money to put her children through school. Viola hopes that in the future she will be able to sell a large variety of accessories. \r\n\r\nViola is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Leone. Having repaid her last Kiva loan successfully, Sia is humbly requesting a new loan of 5,000,000 Sierra Leonean leones in order to further expand her business. Her first Kiva loan made a very huge impact in her business and personal well-being. She was able to make more sales, earn a better profit, and repay the loan. Sia also used the profit she made to buy a plot of land for the future construction of a house and a motor-bike taxi.

She learned the skill of making clothes 40 years ago. She worked in many different workshops where this trade was carried out. It was there she perfected her skills. Later, she left in order to work for herself from home and look after her children. \r\n\r\nAfter separating from her husband, she took on all the household responsibilities. As a result she needed to work more hours so as to have enough income. At present she works for third parties. Her greatest challenge is to get new clients to ensure that her productivity does not drop and in that way affect her economic circumstances. Her work has enabled her to provide her three children with an education.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to increase production. For this reason she is requesting a loan which she will invest in the purchase of supplies, such as fabric, which will enable her to generate higher income and improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1308638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

He\u2019s not the type of man to wait around with his arms crossed so he has decided to use his old truck and offer transportation services to people in distant communities.\r\n\r\nOne of Juan\u2019s goals and dreams is to be able to use the upcoming loan and quickly change his vehicle so he can expand his business and offer a much better service. He is seeking a loan to invest in his scrap business and repair his truck which urgently needs some work. He is very grateful for the support that is given to poor countries like Nicaragua.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1307280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy

She, with the help of her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMa. Ana operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 12,000. She will be utilizing the loan to pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken, vegetables, and products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMa. Ana dreams of her business being successful and hopes to give her children a good education. She meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1307978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken, vegetables, and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-03-09T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-08T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

He's married and has children.  His wife is a homemaker and is need to raise the children since they are still little.  Ilhomjon is a carpenter who has made furniture for a profession for the last 15 years.  He has many clients and has a good reputation among friends and relatives.  He loves his work and takes pride in it.  In his free time, Ilhomjon works with livestock, fattening animals to sell.  It's the furniture-making, however, that is his main source of income.  He dreams of buying a car since it is difficult and expensive to rent vehicles to carry logs and new tools.  With this goal in mind, he has turned to Arvand for a loan since he doesn't not have enough funds to buy the car outright.  He relies on the support of Arvand since purchasing the car will make it much more convenient to deliver orders and to buy raw materials for his

Since 2010, he has grown watermelons and cantaloupe.  His wife and his two children (aged 32 and 26) help him with his work.  The growth of his business began by planting melons.  Ivan has decided to purchase plastic sheeting to cover his greenhouses, and drip hosing for irrigation.

She is married to Mario, a driver, and is a mother to their children. She, with the help of her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\nPriscila operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to cook food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\nPriscila hopes to expand her business and dreams to live a long life to guide her children. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1308019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken, vegetables and products needed to prepare her food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-03-09T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-08T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2034.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355782052},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3390.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488940},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2713.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894566},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2034.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381669610}],"funded_date":"2013-03-10T00:20:18Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:38:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C Pettersen"}},{"id":535536,"name":"Chanbothrey's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chanbothrey is 31 years old and a rural resident from Kandal province.
