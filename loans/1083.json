He is married, and has two children aged six and three; both are school-going children. He has three additional dependents, who live with him to be fostered. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Michael established his assorted timber (boards) business. He began his business because the civil war in Sierra Leone made him unable to further his education. After the war, he decided to learn carpentry. He worked with his boss for some years and the money he got was used to open a small workshop. The workshop has now grown into a bigger one with some modern machines.  \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about SLL 2,150,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan of the amount of SLL 5,000,000.

She is pictured with her hand raised. Gambhini is the featured member of Thambalkhong Mayai Leikai Group. She runs a variety store in her village. She started her business with a very small amount of capital by selling paan, local cigarettes, candy, toffees, dried tobacco packs and vegetables like potatoes, onions and garlic. Her variety store is a winner in the village. People gather around the clock to buy things from her. Gambhini is very prudent with her daily expenses, so she has been able to save and restock with rice, sugar, vegetable oil, detergent soaps and detergent powder. Gambhini\u2019s only son, who is 17 years old, also helps her run the variety store when he is on vacation.\r\n\r\nGambhini joined the group savings and contributes monthly. She is delighted to share this because she used to admire the other group members who were in a position to have savings in the group whereas she was not. With the upcoming loan, she wishes to stock more supplies in the store and hire someone to run errands for the store.

He provides all of their basic needs and is paying their tuition from the little income he earns from their family business.<p>\r\n\r\nRobert started a retail shop business in 2005 as a way to support his family and to improve their social status. This has helped him to support his children and those of his late brother in school, hence brightening their future. His major challenge is lack of sufficient capital to boost his business and at the same time look after his family.<p>\r\n\r\nHe has managed the shop for such a long time because of his good customer service and his positive work attitude. He dreams of growing his enterprise by opening up other outlets to increase his income and also see that his children and dependents get quality educations.

She got married at a tender age, but she wanted to be actively involved in business, so with a few resources from her husband, she started selling scrap and some electrical appliances. She will use the proceeds of her loan to buy electrical appliances. She has challenges, such as the theft of metals around the village, coupled with buying fake metals which aren\u2019t easily sold. Despite all the challenges she goes through, she cannot leave the business because she has to take care of her young children, as her husband's meager resources are inadequate.

She will continue her chicken selling business and will try to do some savings with the group members.

She is poignant about this and hopeful to come into a solution in the future.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, Premita will contact the cloth retailer, deposit a security, and purchase plenty of supplies for tailoring. Her future plan is to get two or more sewing machines and hire an additional tailor for more productivity. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are engaged in wood businesses and jewelry businesses.

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Aftar is one of the many Iraqi women who are working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\n\nShe has five years of experience with small, home-based sewing and tailoring work, making dresses for women and children as well as household items based on orders by her customers.  She would like to improve her work and increase the type of services as well as the level of creativity in her work in order to be able to offer a greater variety of options to her customers.  She would like to buy an overlock machine and nice, good quality fabrics and raw materials.  To pay for these purchases, she took a loan from Relief International-Microfinance Iraq.  \n\nRelief International-Microfinance Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor and who are thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan.  Groups consist of three to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses and for her child's school fees. \r\n\r\nKurniasih operates a food stall. It is open from 10 to 12 AM, and she can get about 80,000 IDR every day. She sells Seasoned Chicken that is already half cooked. The chicken is chopped and boiled in a pan that contains seasonings such as ginger, lime leaves, lemongrass, etc.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 1,000,000 IDR loan. She will be using the loan to buy 40 chickens. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Kurniasih hopes to expand her business, send her child to university and to make a pilgrimage to mecca. Her obstacle in running this business is that the price of chickens is not stable, especially on Big Brother Day and New Year's.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1308166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy 40 chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cawang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":189,"posted_date":"2013-03-11T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-10T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kurniasih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kismiyatin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-29T08:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":411485,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364843345},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-25T08:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":411485,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048681},{"amount":21.25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-03T09:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":205742.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381839899},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":514356.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698254},{"amount":39.96,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-01T09:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":411485,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.54,"payment_id":399944655},{"amount":19,"local_amount":190800,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":196278.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.27,"payment_id":410227758},{"amount":32.52,"local_amount":329500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-26T09:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":338960.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.49,"payment_id":419991652},{"amount":39.63,"local_amount":419900,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T10:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":431956.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.98,"payment_id":429644343},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-30T09:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":246891,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.58,"payment_id":439871999},{"amount":19.47,"local_amount":199800,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-22T08:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":205536.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.76,"payment_id":449761211},{"amount":72.05,"local_amount":720000,"processed_date":"2014-03-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-22T08:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":740672.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.45,"payment_id":459242158}],"funded_date":"2013-03-11T21:54:16Z","paid_date":"2014-03-22T08:56:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":536085,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marina is 52 years old and married with two children.

She loves them all dearly and they provide her main reason for living.  She is a very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who, like her husband, devotes all her efforts to providing for their family.  Unfortunately, due to lack of financial resources and because she had to work from a very early age, Clara was not able to study.  She would, however, have loved to study for a professional cookery qualification.  In her free time, she likes to stroll with her family around the welcoming and sun-drenched streets of her city.   Acting on her own initiative, and with tremendous effort and commitment, Clara works in her small shop where she sells groceries and drinks.   She works daily for between 9 and 12 hours and believes that she does well on account of her good prices and the friendly way in which she serves her customers.  Clara is very grateful to Kiva lenders, whose help enables her to buy merchandise, such as rice, sugar, beans, oil, sweets and soft drinks, amongst other things.  This means that Clara will keep her shop better stocked and cater for her customers and, as a result, will be able to continue working and striving to realise her great ambition of providing a good education for her children and seeing them become successful professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1307722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-11T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-10T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":69.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":95.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":99.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.74},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.74,"local_amount":61.86,"processed_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":64.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483327},{"amount":27.93,"local_amount":69.82,"processed_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":72.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889364},{"amount":28.58,"local_amount":71.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":74.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664265},{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":75.53,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":78.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775565},{"amount":31.04,"local_amount":77.59,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":80.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779003},{"amount":32.33,"local_amount":80.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054191},{"amount":33.99,"local_amount":84.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:52:43Z","rounded_local_amount":88.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819119},{"amount":35.1,"local_amount":87.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":91.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472102},{"amount":36.79,"local_amount":91.96,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":95.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694622},{"amount":119.29,"local_amount":298.23,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":309.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450390699}],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T10:26:44Z","paid_date":"2014-02-21T09:41:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":536095,"name":"Aster Jhane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aster Jhane, age 22, sells vegetables and frozen foods to earn a living.

is 27 years old. He lives with his parents and sister in Telavi District. Several times, Sandro requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have seven milk cows and 11 calves. They produce dairy products to sell locally in an open market, at a good price. Sometimes, they slaughter a cow and sell the meat. But, the income is too small and it is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nSandro's loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Sandro will purchase calves. After purchasing additional calves, he will be able to expand the cattle herd and increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She has raised six children. Ainur's children are grown up, and she lives with her son who helps his mother in the household. Ainur has fourteen grandchildren. \r\n\r\nIn search of a source of funding for her family, Ainur started her business of livestock breeding already in 1990, in the period of the collapse of the Soviet Union, after having used a starting sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Successfully working within the sphere of livestock breeding and field crop cultivation has given very good results. Ainur also grows fodder, which lets her provide fodder for her livestock and gives and additional income from the sale. Ainur grows potatoes on her field too, next to the fodder. She owns 3.0 hectares of land and three heads of cattle.

","en":"A happy father, loving husband, breadwinner and good teacher, Mengnikul was born in a remote town outside of Kishlak. Even during his childhood he wanted to become a teacher. At that time, he walked sheep and cows with his father. He counted, multiplied, and divided out the livestock. Hence, his childhood games and rhymes turned into a profession. Mengnikul was able to realize his dream and become a teacher. \r\n\r\nMengnikul has eight children. He would not have been able to survive and provide for them with only a teacher's salary. So, he had to start raising cows for extra income. He says, \"If it weren't for this occupation and the suitable location, my family would have starved and I would not have survived that.\" To his good fortune, he received a loan from MDO \"Arvand\" a few years ago. By using the loan wisely, he was able to escape the endless circle of problems and the matter gradually worked itself out. \r\n\r\nMengnikul now has a few heads of cattle, but he needs one more cow and additional sources of income to purchase feed. His children have grown and as the years go by he needs to increase his income. He really wants his children to enroll in university after high school so that they will have a bright future. With such intentions in mind, Mengnikul again turned to MDO \"Arvand\" for a loan to purchase livestock. He hopes that MDO \"Arvand\" will help him again during a difficult moment so that he can realize his current plans. As a teacher, he knows what hard work means. Mengnikul never forgets about his students and teaches them well. You could say that he is a role model for his students and children.

Despite his age, he has already managed to create his own small farm. He has about 25 sheep and seven cows. He has 17 years of experience in animal husbandry. He is married and has five children. Animal husbandry is his main source of income. His cows and sheep provide his family not only with milk, but also with their \"daily bread\". \r\n\r\nHabibulo takes his profession very seriously. He spends a large portion of his time in the pasture where he takes his sheep to graze. He has big plans for the future. He wants to build a home and send his son to the city to study. However, his financial circumstances don't allow him to bring his dreams and plans to fruition. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, last year an unfortunate event occurred - some of his sheep died due to flooding and disease. Habibulo pulled himself together and continued on with his work. His wife helped him a lot. She milked the cow, sold the milk, and did the shopping with the income they earned. Now Habibulo is saving and being economical. As the father of five children, he tries to ensure that his family does not go hungry. \r\n\r\nUpon finding out about loans, Habibulo turned to MDO \"Advand\". He would like a loan to purchase livestock and livestock feed at the right moment. He hopes that Arvand will support and help him to recover from his loss. Habibulo, his children, and his wife thank you in advance for your help and understanding.

She is a mother of 2 young daughters with whom she lives in her own house together with her husband of many years. Roc\u00edo sells candy and pastries for a living from the door of her home. Additionally she has various rooms in her home which she rents to have more income. She has been in the pastry business for more than 10 years and does it with the help of her children. The window works for the sale of sweets, which was followed by snow cones, but the climate in the zone is very changing and that does not help for the successful completion of sales. As a business woman she is already seeing the way of being able to generate income with another type of investment. What she likes about her job is that it provides good income and she is able to be at home with her children.

He is married and lives with his wife in Bolnisi District. Levan has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where haricot beans and potatoes are grown. Besides that, Levan works as an artisan in the wood workshop and gets small monthly income. It is hardly enough to feed for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nLevan requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved as one from a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan programme envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Levan plans to open his own workshop, where he will prepare different kinds of wooden furniture.

He installs gas systems in cars and gets a small monthly income which is rarely enough to feed the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nMamuka requested a loan from Credo for his business. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Mamuka will purchase gas containers and a special system for installing the gas in cars, and to have this in stock since he already has orders. Mamuka hopes the business will be successful as he is experienced in his business and has a large number of satisfied clients. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will give Mamuka the chance to develop his business and to provide better living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1309830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase gas containers and a special system for installing the gas in cars.

Alexei is a hardworking, calm, steady person and a good farmer.\r\n\r\nIn this area, growing vegetables in greenhouses is the main type of business for many and in the summer there is a lot of competition.  Alexei installed heating in his greenhouses in order to get an earlier harvest and to start selling earlier.  \r\n\r\nRecently Alexei bought a plot of land nearby and decided to build two greenhouses there.  He built one but does not have enough personal funds for the other.  Alexei is asking for a loan of 24,000 hryvnia.\r\n\r\nAlexei has expansion plans.  He plans to build two more greenhouses and install heating there.

They also have a coffee nursery and sell part of the crop to cover maintenance costs and use the other part for home consumption.  She was able to get an elementary education but could not continue.  Her parents taught her from a very early age to work the land.  Evangelina and her husband believed that through years of hard work and by saving their money they could one day have their own farmland so as not to have to rent land.  They now own a patch of land about 15 minutes from their house, and they walk to it every day.  This allows them to be able to supervise their crops and keep animals, birds and plant disease away.\r\n\r\nEvangelina is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers and other products for maintenance of her corn and bean crops, as well as the coffee nursery.
