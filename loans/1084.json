The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Kakhaber will open a Georgian bread bakery and start his own business. He will bake bread to sell at a good price. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Now she is applying for a new loan through KIVA as she wishes to add items that quickly turn over to her inventory.

Esther plans to buy towels, bedding, multipurpose tools, household items etc. \r\n\r\nIn the future Esther would like to have her own store selling a range of merchandise.

They decided on this name because they are very devoted to this saint as in Mexico he is known as the saint of difficult or impossible situations. They live in a sugar-cane growing area, and their community is the location for the IRSA sugar factory which produces molasses from sugar cane.\r\n\r\nThe following women are members of the group:\r\nMarisela--sells clothing\r\nClaudia--sells popsicles\r\nHilda--sells Mexican snacks\r\nEsperanza--sells soft drinks\r\nReyna--sells Mexican snacks\r\nTeresa--sells Mexican snacks\r\nNicolasa--sells Mexican snacks\r\nFrancisca--sells Mexican snacks\r\n\r\nMarisela is one of the members of the group. A year ago she started selling clothing to her friends and neighbours. She notes that when she started out, it was difficult as she had no customers and she didn\u2019t know if she could earn a profit. However, even though it was a difficult time, she did manage to find customers and gradually her customer base grew.\r\n\r\nEven today she continues to sell from door to door, and sometimes her customers seek her out to make special orders, or when there is a fiesta, they want to buy something simple from her to give as a present.

The businesses that the members of the communal bank carry out are varied, such as weaving blankets, braiding blankets, making rubber sandals, making \u2018picos\u2019 and \u2018chuntillos\u2019 [rustic tools], selling sweets, and running a neighborhood store\n\nThe loan they will take out will benefit small business owners, one of whom is Alicia. She says that she joined Pro Mujer six and a half years ago on an invitation by one of the group\u2019s credit counselors who went to visit her at home. Currently she has a small business selling sweets. She says she launched this business ever since she entered a school as a caretaker. \n\nThe loan that Alicia will take out is to increase her working capital (through the purchase of sweets) that she will get from the fairs in the city of El Alto, and later, sell in her fixed store location. This type of work allows her to generate resources to take care of her home as well as she can. She is married and has four children. \n\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the health training. \n\nIn the photograph, Lucila is missing since she was at a doctor\u2019s appointment in the clinic.

He lives in Makhinjauri District with his wife, son, daughter in-law and two grandchildren who are going to school. Temur requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTemur has a three-flour house. His whole family lives on the second floor of the house and the third floor is rented seasonally. That\u2019s the family's only income which is not enough to feed its six members. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTemur requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's  rural poor. They do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Temur will renovate the first floor which can\u2019t be used for living now. After renovating, he will be renting it out seasonally.

She is a hard working, happy, and enterprising woman. For more than 6 years she has worked in the sale of plastic molds for food, cosmetics, and shoes by catalog. \r\n\r\n\u201cI like this activity. It has always been something that creates an income and it is nice knowing people. I visit my friends and I earn money. The loans that they have given us have helped me to put the money all together and with one go allowed me to supply products. Later I rearrange products and I get ahead. \u201c\r\n\r\nShe completes her sales house by house with her friends and neighbors from the community.  Across these 6 years she has gained good clients that have helped her to sell more and have good earnings. \r\n\r\nShe began this work because she wanted to work and earn her own money, but without neglecting her household.  They invited her to sell by catalog and she decided to try it out.  She ended up liking sales.  \r\n\r\nShe will invest this loan in the purchase of cosmetics (nail polish, lipsticks, liners, shades, makeup, deodorants, and perfumes), variety of shoes, and dishes. \r\n\r\nMiran is 41-years-old, she only studied in High school, and is married to Daniel who works as a teacher. They have two daughters.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to be able to rent a space where she can sell her products, but without leaving her sales made by going to homes.  Also, she would like that her daughters be able to study a professional career.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group: Paulina sells at a food shop, Vianey Del Carmen sells at a food shop, Juana

She lives in Ozurgeti District with her husband, her two infant children and her parents-in-law. Nino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were always rejected because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard, a plot of land where 400 nut trees are grown and a milk cow. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Nino will rent a place to open a plastic shop. She plans to purchase stock of plastic dishes to sell in her shop. Nino will work as a saleslady and will do her best to increase the income of the family.

Kenya. Washington is pictured on the right of Mwichina Group with his hand raised. Washington is pictured amongst the eight men and four women of his group. His loan will allow him to plant \u00bd an acre with sorghum, millet, and maize. Washington first enrolled with One Acre Fund during the 2011 Long Rains and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season.

She has been in this work for one year. She works with the support of her daughter and her son-in-law, who help her in placing the wood in other cities. She learned to do this work a little while ago, since in the past she sold chickens, but she decided to change to the forestry sector because she thought that she would receive better earnings in it. She likes her work, since it gives her time to do other activities in her home. Every day she is more convinced that the activity in which she is working is very good, since she has many regular customers who wait for her products. At this time she is applying for 4000 PEN, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support to continue increasing her working capital.

The group is located in a small town in Indonesia called Cilacap. The group consists of 15 people. Their businesses include selling bed linens, wallets and handbags; selling snacks; selling fried snacks and soy milk; opening a small diner; selling phone credit, LPG, pastries, and vegetables. Because they have been a group together for a long time, they are very close to each other and always look out for each other. When one of them was sick, they collected donations to help pay for the medical expenses and they visited her often.\r\n\r\nIntan II Group is headed by Turyati. Turyati is a single parent with two children \u2013 one still in school. Turyati has a business selling various items like bed linens.

","en":"Karen is 29 years old and lives in the south of the city with her husband and their three children aged between four and 13. She has been working in retail for six years after learning the trade from her mother, who also worked in retail and used to give Karen merchandise to sell. Once she was ready to work on her own, Karen got a loan which she used to buy merchandise, and, little by little, she formed her own clientele who now maintain her business. She uses the income she earns to contribute towards household expenses. She mainly sells women\u2019s clothing, comforters, towels, and underwear to her customers who pay her on credit. Her working day begins at 9 a.m. and ends at 4 p.m., after which she concentrates on the housework. Her main customers are the people from her neighborhood and their contacts, who have gradually become her loyal customers and allowed her business to grow. She is currently requesting a Kiva loan, her first funding from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy household goods, underwear, and other clothing to create more income to pay the household expenses. Her aim is to ensure her children's education so that they are successful and her and her husband can feel satisfied with their work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1310236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy household goods and clothes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-03-12T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-11T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karen Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1170000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85612},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87610},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89654},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91746},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":93887},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96077},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98319},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100613},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":102961},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":105363},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":107822},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":110336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.56,"local_amount":85612,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":85730.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498050},{"amount":48.67,"local_amount":87610,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":87731.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527887},{"amount":49.81,"local_amount":89654,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":89778.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928629},{"amount":50.97,"local_amount":91746,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":91873.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705777},{"amount":52.16,"local_amount":93887,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-26T08:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":94017.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968071},{"amount":53.38,"local_amount":96077,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":96210.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817265},{"amount":54.62,"local_amount":98319,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":98455.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323536},{"amount":55.9,"local_amount":100613,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":100752.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082774},{"amount":57.2,"local_amount":102961,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":103103.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062148},{"amount":179.73,"local_amount":323521,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":323969.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731845}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T07:51:17Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geraldine Pugh","image":null}},{"id":536297,"name":"Naa Aku","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naa Aku is a 36 year-old woman married to Theophilus, a 41 year-old trader.

He is married and lives in the Baghdati District with his wife, two infant sons, and parents.

His loan requests were always rejected due to low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities.  In particular, they have 3 milk cows, a pig, and a vineyard.  They sell cheese products and wine locally.  It is hardly enough to provide food for the family.  According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrakli\u2019s loan request to Credo was approved in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages the provision of credits with soft conditions to country rural poor.  This group does not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d due to low income.  \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Irakli will build a greenhouse.  Irakli plans to sow tomatoes and greens in his greenhouse, which will be sold locally at a good price.  This will increase the income of their family.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

One of their children, thanks to his own efforts and that of his parents, already was able to be admitted to a particular school of the best quality. \r\n\r\nAlex inherited the business of stockbreeding from his older brothers, with whom he went to the town fair since he was a boy. As his business has grown, today he requires a loan so that his animals can be well taken care of, and be sold at a good price in the town's fair. He will use the loan to buy cleaning supplies, vitamins, and food which allow the cattle to stay healthy, and so that there are not complications upon offering them to buyers. His dream is to have a home of his own. Little by little the dream is taking form. Currently he already has a plot of land which is the start of obtaining this dream. On this land he will start the construction of his home. The land where he currently lives belongs to his mother and he wants to have something of his own that his children can inherit.

He lives with his wife and three children in their house.  The oldest son is 14 years old, the middle is 11, and they both attend a school; the youngest daughter is 5 months old.  The wife and older children help Sergei with the work.  They primarily grow tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes.  A large greenhouse fell this year due to snow.

born in the city of Kapan and lives together with her husband and daughter in the Getishen village of the Syunik district.  Her son is working in the Russian Federation and often helps his family in Armenia.  Karine is 47 years old.  She has been involved in agriculture for almost 20 years.  She and her husband have land in the Getishen village, bees, cattle and rabbits.  Karine sells the agricultural products, which her family works hard to produce, in the cities of Kapan and Kadjaran.  She has acquaintances, friends and family, who help her with selling agricultural products because they have stores in Kapan and Kadjaran.  Karine has been diligently involved in beekeeping the last few years.  She read a lot of literature about bees and researched how to correctly care for them in order to obtain quality and ecologically-clean honey.  As Karine confessed, one has to first love bees and have a lot of patience to get a good result.  Karine needs a loan in the amount of 700,000 Armenian dram to purchase bees and hives to develop her beekeeping business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1309249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Kapan of the Siyunik district.  She studied to become an economist at the Kapan construction college.  Liana got married at an early age.  Liana is now 37 years old and a widow; her husband died in a car accident.  Liana has a son, who lives with her along with her parents.  Liana's mother is ill, and father teaches at the Kapan construction college.  Because Liana is raising her son by herself, she does everything to make sure that he grows up to be a deserving citizen of his country, obtains good education and lives happily and without difficulties.  After her husband's death, Liana opened her own business and has been selling food products, clothing and dishware in a leased store in Kapan for almost four years.  Once a month, she buys merchandise at wholesale markets in Yerevan and resells it at her store in Kapan.  She already has many customers, who prefer to buy clothing, dishware and kitchen accessories from Liana's store.  She is very happy that her hard work can support her family, help her father with the household and pay for her ill mother's treatment.  Liana worked with Kiva in 2009, and this is her second loan, with which help she wants to purchase a large inventory of spring merchandise from Yerevan and many kitchen accessories and dishware.  A large Christian holiday of Easter is coming up, and she hopes to make a good profit from holiday sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":1309259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She grows potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, eggplant and many other vegetables in her garden, and also many fruits.  But Juleta especially cares for chickens and turkeys.  She has a large chicken farm near her house, where she keeps many chickens.  She already has many customers, who buy eggs and chicken meat right from her house.  Her husband helps his wife to sell fruits and vegetables at markets in Kapan during his free time.  Juleta decided to increase the number of chickens and buy feed for them for the spring period and this is why she is requesting a loan in the amount of 200,000 Armenian

Wafa and her husband work full time jobs to cover the family's needs, but the income is still not enough.\r\n\r\nWafa is requesting a Murabaha loan from FATEN to help her cover the costs of purchasing a new refrigerator and washing machine. This will allow her to improve the living conditions for her family.\r\n \r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She lives in Senaki district with her 25-year-old husband, Zviad, and two infants. Inga requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her family business startup, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\nThe family has one pig and nine piglets, which are to be sold as meat. Also, they own an agricultural plot of land. Zviad cultivates the land and sows different kinds of vegetables. Harvested products are sold locally at the markets and the family gets a small monthly income. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n<p>\r\nInga requested a loan from Credo to start up the family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provisions of business startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Inga will purchase a milk cow. She will milk it to make dairy products and sell it at the local markets. Inga hopes to develop their farming to have more income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Startup loan, will help her to significantly improve their living conditions and to be able to provide for her children's

So she would like to encourage those who lend money to people like her to continue since it truly makes a difference."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1310041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-03-12T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-11T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":176665.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356589904},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":166666,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":176664.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993869},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667.01,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":176665.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040574},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166666.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":176665.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831199},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":166668,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":176666.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689414},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166665,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":176663.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480555}],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T16:21:48Z","paid_date":"2013-09-20T09:07:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":536365,"name":"Gabriel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gabriel is a sixty-year-old tailor in Mariakani, Kenya.

Her favorite part about the microforestry program is integrating with KOMAZA staff and working in a farmer group.

Her business is located in the outskirts of the city and her main customers are businesswomen, domestic housewives, and other community members. Adama is hardworking and she works seven days a week and 10 hours a day to earn about 1,200,000 SLL every month.

She is native to Le\u00f3n, a place that is located in the western zone of the country. She is known for being a hard-working and responsible woman with a desire for personal self-improvement. Unfortunately, because of a lack of economic resources she could not pursue her studies, since from a very young age she had to work to help with home expenses.\r\n\r\nThanks to her spirit and her desire to come out ahead she has a convenience store situated in her home.

He\u2019s married and has four children one of which is school age.  He\u2019s currently employed as a maintenance man.  He starts work every day at four in the morning sweeping one of the city\u2019s main streets and despite earning so little he does his job with enthusiasm because it allows him to provide daily bread for his home.  He thanks God for having a proper roof to live under and a job because many people in Nicaragua have no jobs and not even enough to eat.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s asking for this loan from Kiva lenders through Ceprodel to buy medicine and to have some medical tests done because he\u2019s not been feeling well recently and he wants to be better to do his job better.  He\u2019s very grateful for this support from lenders who from the kindness of their hearts lend daily to people of limited resources all over the world which is a blessing from God.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1310336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical

esfuerzo, termin\u00f3 la escuela primaria en su ciudad natal Riobamba y luego se traslad\u00f3 para buscar mejores oportunidades con su familia. Trabaj\u00f3 desde muy joven, pues sus escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos no le permit\u00edan seguir prepar\u00e1ndose con la educaci\u00f3n secundaria. Luego de esto, el obst\u00e1culo m\u00e1s grande que \u00e9l ha tenido que atravesar es la separaci\u00f3n de su esposa con quien tuvo 5 hijos, quienes ya son adultos y tienen su vida independiente.  En la actualidad Mart\u00edn vive solo en la Parroquia Chig\u00fcilpe a 15 minutos del centro de Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Esta parroquia tiene varias viviendas de cemento y mixtas de madera con cemento. Tiene un r\u00edo que es muy visitado y en donde los turistas y habitantes practican varios deportes y adem\u00e1s tienen la oportunidad de conocer una cultura ts\u00e1chila que suele contar sus leyendas a los visitantes en medio de una fogata y camping. Santo Domingo que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nMart\u00edn gracias a un amigo aprendi\u00f3 la actividad de panadero y la ejerce por cuenta propia desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, este trabajo que demanda mucho sacrificio, fue el sustento para su familia  y para que sus hijos puedan educarse dignamente al menos hasta conseguir el bachillerato. Actualmente el menor de sus hijos, soltero y mayor de edad, le brinda ayuda en la panader\u00eda con la elaboraci\u00f3n del pan y la venta en el local y a domicilio. Invierte en este negocio por lo menos 6 horas cada d\u00eda desde antes que salga el sol para tener el pan listo y fresco para las primeras ventas de la ma\u00f1ana. En estos d\u00edas su hijo y \u00fanica ayuda en la panader\u00eda, ha tenido algunas complicaciones de salud, sin embargo Mart\u00edn no ha dejado de elaborar el pan que tanto gusta a sus clientes. Ahora requiere un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en el mantenimiento y reparaci\u00f3n de su horno, pues de esta forma evitar\u00e1 que \u00e9ste se aver\u00ede y le causa demoras en la elaboraci\u00f3n de pan como le ha estado sucediendo. Mart\u00edn espera realizar este tipo de mantenimientos cada a\u00f1o para evitar p\u00e9rdidas y que as\u00ed sus ingresos mejoren y poder mejor su estilo de vida para tener una buena vejez. Mart\u00edn agradece la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva para que personas alrededor del mundo ayuden a financiar este proyecto y tambi\u00e9n agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa porque es su primer cr\u00e9dito y se ha sentido muy c\u00f3modo con la atenci\u00f3n y asesor\u00eda que all\u00ed le han brindado. ","en":"Mart\u00edn, 61, sets an example of hard work and effort. He finished elementary school in his birth city of Riobamba and later moved in search of a better opportunities for his family. He started working at an early age as lack of money kept him from going to high school. Besides this, the greatest challenge he had to overcome was separating from his wife, with whom he has five grown, independent children.\r\n\r\nMart\u00edn lives alone in Chig\u00fcilpe parish, about 15 minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. Here business is very active since the area has become a commerce link between Ecuador's mountains and coast. There are cement and cement-wood houses in the parish. The river attracts many tourists and residents, who practice a variety of sports and have a chance to know the Ts\u00e1chila culture while listening to tales as they sit around a fire or camp. Santo Domingo has the third largest population in the area. Farming, raising livestock, fishing, and manufacturing are the largest industries.\r\n\r\nMart\u00edn learned to make bread from a friend and has been working for himself for 15 years. The work demands sacrifice and has been his family's source of income and has allowed his children to study at least through high school. His youngest son is a single adult and helps Mart\u00edn in the bakery, making bread and selling in the shop and delivering to homes. He works from sunup for at least six hours each day so that the bread is ready and fresh for the first sales of the morning. His son is his only help in the bakery. Mart\u00edn has some health problems, but he hasn't stop making bread that his customers love.  \r\n\r\nHe needs a loan to repair and maintain his oven so that it doesn't break down and slow down production, as it doing now. Mart\u00edn expects to do this type of maintenance every year to avoid losses. This way his income increases, and he can live better now and in his later years. Mart\u00edn is grateful for Kiva loans that provide financing for projects around the world. He also thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for his first loan. He is happy with the service and counseling he has received.

His biggest challenge is 'Low financial resources to boost agricultural production.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Tuiyobei, chamuit\". He will use the loan to buy a chaff cutter and a water tank.\r\n\r\nJohn was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Knew about Juhudi from neighbours and friends.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How I can use funds from the MFI to acquire assets for agricultural purposes.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', John replied 'Will purchase a chaff cutter and a water tank to be used in dairy production.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. John owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, electricity, TV' but does not have 'solar power, running water, sewing machine, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

Norayr has a higher education; he graduated from Yerevan Political Institute with a major in mechanical engineering. Norayr lives with his wife and two daughters in their hometown Kapan. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Norayr works in the Kapan Municipality. However as Norayr admitted, with his salary it is very difficult to adequately support his large family and therefore he decided to engage in business. \r\n\r\nNorayr has his own premises in Kapan, where he organizes a variety of business seminars and often rents the place for such events. He considers that Kapan needs these kinds of premises as this is a growing city with a huge potential, and he is certain that his conference room will soon host major seminar and workshops, which will focus on the development of Kapan and the Syunk district. \r\n\r\nNorayr needs a loan of 1,000,000 Armenian dram to complete the repair work on his conference room.

She is married and has three beautiful children. Recently, her husband left for Russia to earn money and in order to buy a ticket Matluba had to sell cattle. Her husband promised to send money as soon as he found a job. But while her husband is not sending money, Matluba on her own needs to earn a living for herself and her children. \r\n\r\nHer household has a few head of cattle. They can not be sold for now because they are not sufficiently fattened. Therefore, she turned to Arvand to get a loan for the purchase of cattle.

is Lorna. She previously accessed a 10,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help in her personal, house hold and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 10,000 PHP to buy more merchandise like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics needed in her business. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nLorna dreams of expanding her business and hopes to have a good life with her family.

She will use it to buy materials and supplies such as clothing, thread and accessories, with which she will provide beautiful finishing touches to all of the garments, as requested by her best customers.

","en":"Holmirzo applied to MDO Arvand for a loan in order to increase his livestock. HE has been raising livestock for 30 years. He is 61 years old, but, in spite of his age, he works tirelessly. He is married and has three children. The children have already started their own families and help out their parents as much as possible. At present \n\nHolmirzo has run out of feed for his livestock. HE cannot sell livestock right now; he needs to keep feeding it until the summer starts.

He is employed as a guard in one of his village's workshops.  However, his main activity is animal husbandry, which he does from home.\r\n\r\nAlihon is seriously involved in raising sheep. Every four to five months, he takes a couple of sheep to the market, he sells them at a good price, and then immediately buys another couple of lambs to be fattened.  He also shears sheep and sells their wool.  With the sheep's wool, Alihon's wife also makes balls of yarn; in that case the wool is sold at a higher price.  Alihon tries very hard to keep his business in good financial balance.\r\n\r\nAlihon is now planning to buy more lambs to be sold at a premium during the upcoming national holidays.  He will save his profits towards retirement and also to give a dowry to his grandchildren.  He really hopes to receive some support from Kiva, in order to be able to realize his projects."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1306064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Asht","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.666667 70.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-03-13T03:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-12T03:30:01Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alihon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":142.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":147.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":152.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":157.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":162.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":168.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":174.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":179.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":186.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":192.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":198.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.29,"local_amount":137.83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":139.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863731},{"amount":30.28,"local_amount":142.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":143.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572680},{"amount":31.31,"local_amount":147.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":148.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971450},{"amount":32.37,"local_amount":152.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":153.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751965},{"amount":33.46,"local_amount":157.49,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":159.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616039},{"amount":34.61,"local_amount":162.83,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":164.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859912},{"amount":35.77,"local_amount":168.35,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":170.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136658},{"amount":36.99,"local_amount":174.06,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":175.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900856},{"amount":38.24,"local_amount":179.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":181.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550041},{"amount":122.68,"local_amount":577.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":583.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774268}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T15:08:24Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":536626,"name":"Pene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pene is 56 years old, married and has six children.

Her work starts at 7:00am when she purchases all the ingredients she will need to make her delicious meals.  She receives customers at the end of the day.  She serves the meals in front of her home.  She has a couple of tables set up there, a kitchen and everything she has prepared to offer her customers.  She has had this business for more than seven years, and she runs it with the help of her mother.  What Ruth likes best about her work is that it is comfortable; she is independent and can use her time as she pleases.  She hopes to continue with this phase of growth, as she has grand plans for what she considers to be a very profitable business.  At this time, she is requesting S\/. 1000 soles (USD $400).  Ruth is grateful for the opportunity and the confidence that has been placed in her with the loan.  She also promises to punctually comply with her repayment plan.  With the requested sum, Ruth will purchase the ingredients and supplies she needs to continue making her meals.  She will also add some tables and chairs to her set-up, which she needs in order to accommodate more customers.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1311141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ingredients and kitchen supplies.
