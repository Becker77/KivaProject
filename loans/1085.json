Presently, he and his wife live in the village of Nor Arajadzor, near Kapan. Grenik is 67 years old, a pensioner, and a happy grandfather. He has a son and a daughter, who already have their own families.\r\n\r\nDespite his age, Grenik cannot imagine his life without his favourite work. He graduated from a technical college as a mechanic. He has been working as a tractor operator\/mechanic since then, and his services are in great demand. Grenik has his own tractor, which he uses to earn a living. While his wife works in their garden and takes care of their livestock, Grenik uses his tractor to work their neighbours' fields from morning til night. Grenik also has his own plot of land where he cultivates wheat and barley.\r\n\r\nDespite the hard work, Grenik is glad to be able to take care of his family without the help of his children, despite his advanced years, and takes pride in the fact that he occasionally gives his children a hand with their household chores.\r\n\r\nGrenik's tractor is very old and needs a major overhaul. It is already spring, and Grenik has many work orders. He is in a hurry to repair his tractor in time for the spring sowing. Grenik is requesting a Kiva loan of 800,000 Armenian dram to purchase spare parts for his agricultural equipment and to carry out major repairs on his tractor."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1309555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

engaged in agriculture on his plot of land in Kapan. With his own hands, he has built a plastic-covered greenhouse where he grows herbs and vegetables such as parsley, radishes, coriander and onions. He sells fresh herbs year round at Kapan's markets, whereas sometimes bulk purchasers buy his herbs directly from his greenhouse. Armenak considers greenhouse cultivation of vegetables and herbs to be a very profitable agricultural activity as the profits far exceed the investment. That said, taking care of the greenhouse is hard work, and Armenak admits that it is necessary for him to love his work to get a good harvest. He constantly reads various technical literature about greenhouses and dreams of constructing a large technologically advanced greenhouse, with drip irrigation and a modern heating system, but currently lacks the funds and technical know-how to make this happen.\r\n\r\nArmenak lives in the city of Kapan together with his wife, son and daughter. His wife is a librarian, and in her spare time she gives her husband a hand in the greenhouse and also helps him take care of their cows and chickens. Armenak has post-secondary education as an engineer, but since there are no jobs available for him in Kapan, he prefers to work in agriculture.\r\n\r\nArmenak needs a loan to purchase plastic film covering for his greenhouse, as well as fodder for his chickens and cows."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1309589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastic covering for his greenhouse and fodder for his chickens and cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2013-03-13T09:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-12T09:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armenak","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":16150},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":14670},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15480},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15330},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15440},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15950},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15970},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":16180},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":16480},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":16700},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":16860},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":17080},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17460},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":17510},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17860},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":18030},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18280},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":18570}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.95,"local_amount":16381.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":16811.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355901765},{"amount":36.1,"local_amount":14438.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":14817.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364613405},{"amount":39.25,"local_amount":15700,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":16112.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373009606},{"amount":37.78,"local_amount":15110,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15506.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381795374},{"amount":41.65,"local_amount":16660,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":17097.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390658181},{"amount":37.95,"local_amount":15180,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T16:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":15578.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399903936},{"amount":516.32,"local_amount":206530,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T17:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":211956.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410185697}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T14:10:42Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T17:33:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":537327,"name":"Nong Taaba Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme SYLVIE est responsable du groupe NONG-TAABA.

She lives with her parents and sister in Kapan. Her sister is a student. Her father does construction work and her mother has worked in clothing sales for many years now. \r\n\r\nAs it is difficult to support a large family in a small town like Kapan, in 2012 Anna decided to try her hand at business. She has been renting a stall and selling women's clothing at the Kapan fair for a year now. Before opening her own business Anna helped her mother in her stall and hence knows well the difficulties of the business. She already has regular clients not only in Kapan, but also in nearby villages. The secret to her success is that she is young and understands fashion trends well. She brings new clothing to Kapan from wholesale markets in Yerevan every month. \r\n\r\nAnna uses the profit from her business to help her parents support the family and her sister pay for school. Anna needs a loan of 2700 Armenian dollars to purchase spring and summer clothing in Yerevan for her stall in Kapan.

She lives with Eduardo, her husband. They have three young children, who they bring up in the house that they inherited from her parents. \r\n\r\nTheir land is located one hour from town, so they built a small home close by to look after their agricultural land and crops- potatoes and corn. They still don't have their own land, so they rent large areas for a year, and for this reason they don't have to worry about paying the rent monthly. \r\n\r\nAlongside her husband, Rosa cares for, fertilizes and waters the plants.

They like life in the country and for the time being, they will continue to work and save to buy their own home. This is Rosa's second loan with Kiva. She is grateful for the opportunity given, since she can improve her work. For this reason, she promises to make her loan repayments on time.  Rosa will invest 1500 soles in buying organic fertilizer, to nourish her next crop of corn and other agricultural produce.

He has worked in the Kapan ore processing plant for many years. He completed the Kapan technical school with a specialty in mining. Tomik lives with his wife in Kapan while his daughter and son live and work in Yerevan. They help their parents in Kapan. \r\n\r\nTomik's profession is very dangerous and harmful to human health. Although he has always loved his trade and happily worked as a miner despite the difficulties, Tomik is no longer so young and he decided to start working in another field. He and his wife have opened their own shop in Kapan. Tomik's wife purchases clothing at the wholesale markets in Yerevan and brings them to Kapan to resell. According to Tomik, it is more advantageous to work in sales than in mining in Armenia. Hence, he is satisfied with his new trade. \r\n\r\nTomik needs a loan of 1,000,000 Armenian dram in order to renovate his small clothing shop in Kapan. He is hoping for help from Kiva.

Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Irma will rent a counter at the local market and purchase flowers at wholesale prices. She and her sister will then sell them with a price markup. The profit will be used for reinvesting and buying more flowers. As they are both experienced in this field, Irma hopes the business will be successful.

Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Anastasia will purchase a sewing machine and materials for sewing bedclothes. She has a basement in her house, which will be used as a workshop, so she will not have to pay money for rent. The bedclothes she makes will be sold locally at the markets and among her villagers. As Anastasia won\u2019t have too many expenses except buying materials, she hopes the business will be profitable. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family, and Anastasia will be able to provide a better life for her

He lives in Batumi, West Georgia with his retired father, Guri, who is 75 years old.

His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only sources of income for the family are Guri's monthly pension and a small salary of David's, who is working as an artisan in a private building company. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nDavid requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received loan, David will buy all materials needed to renovate a flat. After the flat is renovated, he plans to rent it out. Because of tourism development in Batumi, David believes that renovating this flat will help him to earn more income.

Having raised seven daughters who are now all out of the house, Juan and his wife Sabina take care of the household and the farm together, hiring outside help when necessary. \n\nJuan first got into cacao via a community cacao-farming project. A group of San Jose villagers mobilized into a community to request a land concession from the government on the condition of cultivating cacao in an agroforestry system. Agroforestry refers to a system of land use that involves a combination of agriculture and natural forestry, whereby cash crops like cacao are grown alongside timber trees, conserving the environment and providing a source of income for farmers.  \n\nCacao has been instrumental for the family to be able to meet their needs. For many Mayan villagers, it is the sole source of income, bringing liquidity to communities that traditionally barter for the goods and services they need. According to Juan, the best thing about cacao is that as long as you are able to work it, it brings in money. Cacao is a tree that once productive continues to yield pods for decades, on the average some 50 years. The most challenging part of growing cacao for Juan is harvesting, because it takes up a lot of time and effort, and is a very messy process.  Cacao pods house about 35 seeds surrounded by a sweet pulp. Harvesting cacao means cracking the pods open to scoop out the seeds, which can then be processed or sold fresh. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to hire help in the community to clean the cacao fields and for harvesting.

This helped her to purchase a variety of merchandise to meet her customer\u2019s demands and earn a bit more money so she could take advantage of each commercial season. She is currently applying for a Kiva loan to buy shirts, pants, shorts, shoes and chickens so that both of her businesses can continue to grow together and to be able to save and invest her profits.

36, and his wife Sarita are raising two children in the village of San Jose in Belize\u2019s southernmost Toledo district. A son of a cacao farmer, Benito got inspired to start his own cacao farm and started by planting 500 trees six years ago.  \n\nHaving been exposed to cacao farming from an early age, Benito has taken a liking to it and says that he enjoys everything that goes into cultivating this crop. Cacao is a permanent crop, so once planted and productive, cacao trees continue producing an average of 80 pods a year for decades onward. Maintaining the trees healthy requires cleaning the underbrush about three times a year, and pruning annually to keep production levels high. The hardest part of cacao farming for Benito is fighting monilia \u2013 an infectious fungal disease that makes the pods turn black and spreads through their pores. To prevent infection, farmers harvest the infected pods and stow them away from the trees. \n\nBesides cacao, the family grows rice, corn, beans and plantain for home use, and sells some of it locally. Benito is requesting this loan to do routinely cleaning of his farm and to bag 1,000 seeds for an expansion. Cacao is planted by first raising the seed in a bag filled with topsoil and then transplanting it into the ground. Cacao seedlings are ready for transplantation when they have four leaves, about six months after they are bagged.

She lives in Tsnori District with her 52-year-old mother and retired grandmother. Nino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is the monthly pension of Nino\u2019s grandmother. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Nino will cover the costs of purchasing her stock of basic groceries. She owns a small commercial space where she will start a grocery store. As Nino doesn\u2019t have to pay rent, the business will be more profitable and with the profit she plans to increase the turnover in her trade business gradually. Nino will work hard and she will be able to improve the living conditions for her family. With this loan, her family will generate enough income to access regular available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market in the event they need them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1310661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Gocha and his father harvest grapes to make wine, which they sell locally at the markets. They earn a small monthly income, which is the only source of income of the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGocha has requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Gocha will purchase melon seedlings. He and his father will cultivate land to sow the melons to harvest and sell locally at the markets. The profit will be used to reinvest in the same business, and Gocha will sow more melons, which will increase the family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will give Gocha a chance to look after his aged parents and to provide better living conditions for them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1310686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase melon seedlings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Bakurtsikhe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-13T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-12T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gocha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":518.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133677},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":518.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107273}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T21:40:21Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":536726,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of ten children, Susana works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business that buys and sells fruits and root crops in the Philippines.

They have five children, age 4 to 42, one of who lives in with the family. The older children have jobs in the city and one is also a cacao farmer. \n\nVicente started growing cacao 27 years ago with a group of farmers that got a land concession to start cultivating cacao in an agroforestry system, growing cacao among timber trees that provide the necessary nutrients and shade for healthy production. They planted the cacao communally and divided it into parcels once the trees became productive. Cacao trees typically take three to five years to start producing pods, depending on the soil, shade and genetics. Vicente manages a two-acre farm with about 650 trees. \n\nFarming cacao is a little hard, says Vicente, however he likes that it is a permanent crop with harvest seasons that come and go for many years. The most challenging part of cacao farming is the constant battle with diseases, he says. Cacao farms in southern Belize are subject to monilia, an infectious fungal disease that makes pods black and spreads from its pores. \u201cIf you don\u2019t check often, the disease spreads up,\u201d Vicente told Maya Mountain Cacao in English, his second language after his native Maya Mopan. \n\nIn the future, Vicente hopes to expand his farm, something he has been planning but lacking capital to start. Cacao farm expansion requires hard work and time, starting from clearing the land for planting, raising seedlings in bags for six months, lining the land to map out where the plants will go and finally the transplantation into the ground. Moreover, cacao trees take three to five years to become productive, making expansion a long-term investment. For the meanwhile, Vicente is requesting this loan to clean and prune his two acres of cacao. Cleaning means clearing underbrush surrounding cacao trees to clear access to them for pruning and harvesting. Pruning is the process of cutting non-productive branches to increase yields in the coming season. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1312051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"Hire help to clean and prune cacao.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-03-13T21:40:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-12T21:40:22Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751703},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993444},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255613},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136453},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900669},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088550},{"amount":50.5,"local_amount":101,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":101.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673288},{"amount":24.5,"local_amount":49,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":49.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467959963},{"amount":50,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180745}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T23:27:20Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T13:07:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":536790,"name":"Ruzanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruzanna is from the Siznak villagein the Syuniq region of Armenia.

She paints ceramic objects which decorate home interiors and sells them on credit to a customer base that she has created little by little since beginning her business. She still dreams of growing, but she needs to improve working conditions, because they affect her family. For this reason, she is requesting a loan from Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to move her workshop to a space behind the house. Through doing this, she will see a difference in her family's peace of mind.\r\n\r\nHer aim is to have a trading post in a special place where art and the artist converge, so that there is a place in

For the past three years, Ahmad has had a grocery store selling different types of groceries. It has been a profitable project, but not enough to cover the necessary costs. He would like to develop his business by buying a new laptop and start selling units for mobiles to his customers.\r\n\r\nAhmad is requesting a loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing a new laptop. This will increase revenues and increase Ahmad's income.\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Ilian helps her clients improve their personal image through hair treatments and styling services such as straightening, haircuts, color treatments, manicures and pedicures. She works from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays as well as on weekends and holidays in the seasons where business is thriving.\r\n\r\nIlian's goal for the future is to see her son finish studying a professional career and be successful. Currently, she is requesting her first Kiva loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in order to buy a styling chair, mirror, and beauty products to set up her shop and attract customers. She wants to make sure her clients find her salon a comfortable place with excellent service so that they return. This is exactly what makes her Kiva loan a good investment.

She lives in a traditional family setting with other couples and their children.  She is a resident of the Hamdallaye neighborhood of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nSira left school at a very young age, and she got involved in small retail alongside her mother who was selling condiments.  After learning from her mother for several years, she now works alone and sells rechargeable phone cards.  She has been involved in this activity for seven years and has many customers.\r\n\r\nEager to meet her customers' demand, she joined Soro Yiriwaso seven years ago.  Having duly repaid 14 solidarity loans, she is now taking her first individual loan which will be used to buy rechargeable phone cards.

Her husband has been working at the department of urban development for five years. Her son has recently begun working as a driver at a private business entity. She herself has been working as a janitor at a high school for eight years and before this job, she worked for twenty-eight years at a public service organization. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve her family\u2019s living standard, she wants to build a house on her son\u2019s yard.  Compared to a Mongolian traditional ger, the house will be more spacious and better at heat preservation. She is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT to purchase cement, bricks and planks to build a house. As a result, in harsh winter time, the family can live in a more comfortable and warmer place. The most important aspect of building a house is that it enables the family to burn less coal thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution by emitting less smoke. The borrower is very hardworking individual who strives for better future.

Her son is a fourth year student at a railroad college and her daughter is first year university student. She herself has been working as a machine operator at a printing company for seven consecutive years. For twenty years, her husband has been working in an electric grid servicing company as an electrician. The automobile the family has been using for transportation has been deteriorating over the years and now it is out of service. She is requesting a loan of 3,100,000 MNT to purchase an electric vehicle.  \r\n\r\nEnvironmental advantages of electric vehicles include, and are not limited to: it releases almost no air pollutants at the place where they are operated. In addition, it is generally easier to build pollution-control systems into centralized power stations than retrofit enormous numbers of cars. Electric vehicles typically create less noise pollution than an internal combustion engine vehicle, whether it is at rest or in motion. Electric vehicles emit no tailpipe CO2 or pollutants such as NOx, NMHC, CO and PM at the point of use. In conclusion, based on above mentioned advantages, purchasing of electric vehicle will contribute to the efforts against air pollution, as well as can be used as an income generator for the family by using it for a taxi service. The borrower is one of the trustworthy clients of our organization and used her previous loan for its very purpose and paid each installment debt on the due dates.

His wife also works at the same company as a member of the construction armature crew. His eldest child is five years old and youngest child is three years old. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of 3000000 MNT to purchase building materials, such as planks, cement, bricks and metals to build a house on his land. In doing so, the family can live in a comfortable and warm place, where they will burn less coal; thus contributing to efforts against air pollution by emitting less smoke. \r\n\r\nAlso, at this time of year, the price of building materials generally reaches its lowest rate and purchasing building materials now will save large amounts of money for him.

Taking advantage of her husband's 20 years of experience, Patricia opened a butcher shop in a family-owned locale through a joint venture with her husband.  They sell meat and disposable products.  The business grew little by little and even though she worked elsewhere, she helped her husband out part-time.  But it got difficult to care for her child so she decided to quit work and dedicate her time exclusively to the business.\r\n\r\nThe experience from her husband and his family was the most important, positive factor in strengthening the business.  Today, their growth expectations are higher than they were before because they are in a good location with a lot of vehicle traffic that will help increase sales.  Their competitors are stores that sell less quantity of the same products at a higher price, so that means their shop has more customers.  This is exactly why she is requesting a CrediKiva loan, her first from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  It will be used to buy beef, poultry, pork and fish in larger quantities in order to supply the increased daily demand.  She also will buy disposable plates, cups and other products at discount prices.  She will offer better prices to the customers and earn a higher income from the sales volume.  This is the reason for the investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1312020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

She makes and sells bread and has been a bread baker for more than 8 years. Her bakery is located in the community of Zanja Honda. This loan is her second cycle in the institution. She used the previous loan for her business. Julia will use this loan to buy ingredients such as flour, yeast and lard to make the bread. Her reason for asking for this loan is to buy the ingredients wholesale, since it is cheaper to buy in large quantities. Julia faces challenges in her business, such as getting more customers and in this way generating more income. She is going to use the profits to offer a better quality of life for her family. Julia feels happy and grateful with the institution for the support it has offered to her and to all of the other members of the group, because they are people who work very hard to get their families ahead.

She wants to reinvest in her business and in the coming years she would like to expand this business. She says that she is planning to ensure a happy future for her family with the profits.

growing tomatoes and cucumbers on his own land in the village of Vodyanoye.  This has been his profession for 12 years.  He has three plots of land.  The  income from his garden is around 350,000 griven annually.  Dmytryi needs a loan of 24,000 griven to install heating in his greenhouses and to purchase a boiler.  Next year, he wants to use his heated greenhouses to plant vegetables earlier.  Last year an unfortunate mishap landed Dmytryi in the hospital when his sleeve caught in his motorized ground-tiller.  It dragged him along the ground and he hit his head on a pipe and lost consciousness.  He woke up in hospital in Kiev.  Although he had to spend 60,000 griven on his recovery, he's fortunate to not have any permanent damage.  This accident unfortunately happened during the spring, when there was much work to be done in the garden that he was not able to do.  Although his friends helped, the crop was too late and Dmytryi had to sell his car.  This year is much better.  He has purchase another car and continues to work.

She is married and the mother of a three-year-old son. She lives with her family in her own home. Her work consists of purchasing bunches of plantains from the communities surrounding the city. Then she sells them from her home and at times she sells them on the street to her neighbors, friends and relatives. She always has fresh, high-quality plantains. She has run this business for about three years. She enjoys her work because she can earn extra income and thus contribute to household expenses. She believes it is profitable because her products are in high demand.

It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nKhatuna requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nSince her husband has a rich experience in this field, she decided to start their own bakery. With the received credit, they will buy all the needed equipment to bake Georgian bread. Khatuna thinks that the business will be profitable and they will be able to increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She has four children of the ages of 8, 12, 19 and 20. She lives in her own home where she lives comfortably with her children. Lecy's work consists of selling food during the nighttime but she goes out to the market very early to get the freshest chicken and vegetables and prepare the best dishes she can and sell them outside of her home. Among the dishes that are found here are \"salchipollo\" (a hot dog and chicken dish), \"salchipapas\" (a hot dog and french fry dish), fried chicken and other snack foods that are common where she lives. She has a hot dog truck which she uses for work. She has had this business for about four years. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is that it gives her time to carry out her household chores and not neglect her children who still need her care. It is going well for her; she now earns almost double her investment. She would like to have a grocery store in the future so that she can generate greater earnings from her home. With the amount requested of 1000 soles, she wil buy tables, chairs and some supplies and ingredients including plantains, flour, rice, etc. She is thankful for the financial support that is brought to her so that she can continue working.
