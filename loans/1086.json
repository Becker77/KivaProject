Her loan request was rejected every time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for her family is the small incomes of her husband and son. Both are working as artisans: they repair cars and receive a small daily income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMaradi requested loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and who are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Maradi will purchase all the needed equipment for the grocery store that she plans to open, in which she will work as a sales lady. This will increase the income of the family.

three wonderful girls.  After finishing university with a degree in history, she started a career as a history teacher. However, the main source of the income for her family has been her livestock business which she has run for 7 years.  She started this business with 12,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, today she has 1 calf, 10 sheep and 1 horse.  Nurzada also farms a half hectare of land with her husband where they grow beans.  Each year, the family earns around 150,000 KGS from their crop and reselling livestock.

great capacity for work.  She's a widow and has only one reason for living, her son Maycol, 18.  She has a house made of quality materials where she shares her family experiences.\r\n\r\nInitially she sold food in the wholesale market in her town, which enabled her to start building her house.  As time went by she managed to set up the first floor of her house and later she opened her grocery store.

She lives in a remote village in southern Kyrgyzstan.  Like many families in the area, Kanyshai and her husband farm, garden, and fatten livestock.  They started their business with only 2,000 KGS after the fall of the Soviet Union.  Kanyshai raises bulls, and the sale of meat products brings in around 9,000 KGS each month for the family.  With the goal of further developing her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 60,000 KGS to buy additional animals to resell.  What's left of the loan she plans to use to buy fertilizer and seeds to plant in the spring.  She plans on using the income from the loan to build a barn for her livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1311387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a cow for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Syrt village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-15T04:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-14T04:40:01Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.54,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanyshai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":30482.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013969},{"amount":615.96,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":30482.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.54,"payment_id":467830738}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T13:57:52Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T10:23:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Blake Griffin","image":1939381}},{"id":537325,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is a 32-year-old married woman and a mother of two children ages 12 and 7.

But the tension between them escalated and caused them to continually debate what type of music they should be creating. \n\n\u201cThe band wasn\u2019t making the type of music I really like,\u201d Tiaffo says, so he left the group to produce others\u2019 music. \u201cI thought it would be a good way to make money,\u201d he says. He then opened Excelsior Media Concern, a media production company that creates and produces beats and music videos.\n\nMost media producing companies in Tiaffo\u2019s hometown of Little Rock focus only on rap.  His company does much more.  \u201cIn addition to rap, we work with pop, gospel, and other types of music,\u201d he says.\n\nThe flexibility of creating his own schedule and having a job that allows him to express his creativity attracted Tiaffo to becoming self-employed.  \u201cIt was a matter of taking my strength and passion and just doing it.\u201d\n\nStarting out, he didn\u2019t know much about creating and producing music, other than the fact that he loved it.  Most of what he learned was hands-on trial and error. The self-taught Tiaffo says he read a lot of books and articles on how to properly obtain his goal of making music and music videos for a living.\n\nWhile researching the industry, Tiaffo read about Accion Texas Inc. in Black Enterprise Magazine. He later applied and was approved for a loan. \n\nFor the last four years, Tiaffo has been the sole employee, but he plans to hire a small team later this summer. \n\nHis website, www.tiaffo.com, is where he houses some of his beats. Tiaffo also showcases some of his own original music on his ReverbNation profile:

well, they\u2019ll be loyal.  But before he could work, his parents taught him to be respectful and treat people the way he wants to be treated.\n\nTherefore, high morale is what makes Cell Phone Accessory Store a successful venture.\nKevin not only offers cell phone accessories such as car chargers, batteries, cases, Bluetooth items, and stereo headsets \u2013 he also repairs broken screens, is an authorized Cricket Communications dealer, and provides utility bill pay.\n\nOriginally from Helena, Arkansas, Kevin and his wife decided to move to Little Rock in 1997 for greater work opportunities.  He has owned his new business for about a year and a half.\n\n\u201cWhen I came up with the idea to open an accessory store, I dealt with customers who just wanted to fix a problem \u2013 mostly trying to find accessories for older phones. We have a lot of customers who want only the basic phones. That makes our store a lot more unique. We offer accessories for every carrier. We\u2019re not biased on the type of items we have.\u201d\n\nHe says he enjoys the profitability that comes with being an entrepreneur. \u201cI run my store just as I want to be treated,\u201d he says. However, Kevin\u2019s main goal is to earn financial freedom and to better provide for his family so they may continue to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nCurrently, Kevin has two employees. As the business continues to grow, he\u2019ll hire more.  He plans to cap his staff at 15 employees. His major goal is to open multiple stores. Before he gets to that point, he\u2019ll need to expand his customer pool, which means increasing his inventory.\n\n\u201cI did a ton of searching for lending companies,\u201d Kevin says. \u201cThen a customer came in and mentioned Accion Texas Inc. about a year ago. I applied for a loan, but decided not to go through with it because I was doing fine. With the type of cash I was asking for, I decided to hold off.\u201d\n\nLater, when he did need a loan to ramp up his business, he remembered Accion and ventured into the Little Rock office to re-apply \u2013 and was approved.\n\nHis loan will help to purchase more inventory, and therefore, increase the potential for more sales. \u201cI try to make sure I have everything. I only keep one or two of each product at a time,\u201d Kevin says. \u201cOther wireless stores send their customers to me if they don\u2019t have an item. Once the customer gets in, they find out we offer utility bill pay and cheaper accessories. As I continue to make profit, I can stock two or three products. I can use the capital to purchase more of what I need.\u201d\n\nWithout the loan, Kevin wouldn\u2019t be able to serve as many customers. \u201cClients don\u2019t want to wait, especially if they need something immediately,\u201d he says. The Accion loan helps him stock multiples of everything, keep his customers happy and, most importantly, keep up with his competition. \n\nWhile he is currently working on a website, check out his

appears in her Kiva profile. Eman is a married woman from Jabalia. She lives in a simple house with her husband and two sons. Her husband works for a low wage, which is not enough to cover the family's needs. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 2,517 USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing new living room furniture in order to improve the living conditions in her house. Taking this loan will offer Eman comfortable furniture so she can enjoy living in her house.\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She grows vegetables in her paddy fields and sells them in the market place. Her produce includes yams, pumpkins, cucumbers, corn, beans, peas, etc. The bowl in the picture contains the seeds and small plants of vegetables which she will grow.  She\u2019s been in this business for the past 30 years, since she lacked education and capital to start a big business like running a variety store.\r\n\r\nShe looks forward to this Kiva loan to buy piglets to raise and sell to make good money. She will also continue her vegetable-selling business besides raising the piglets. Tingjahat\u2019s only wish is to provide education for all her grandkids, which she failed to accomplish for her kids, due to poor financial conditions of the family. She hopes to get a profit by selling the fully grown pigs and send her grandkids to a good institute.

After getting together enough investment capital she was able to start selling organic fertilizer and other farming supplies. She has been working on her business for 5 years and since then has been able to consolidate and convert it into a good business, thanks to commercializing bird guano and natural fertilizers that are in high demand in her area. \r\nShe is thankful for her work because it is easier than working in the fields but still requires a lot of effort because occasionally she needs to travel to Lima to supervise the transfer of her orders. She needs working capital to be able to continue growing her business she is coming to this financial institution. Her long term goal is to purchase a vehicle in order to move her product. She needs 400 dollars in order to purchase more organic fertilizer and then she will sell it to local farms. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1312883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase organic fertilizer.

","en":"Ziyodajon is a very hard-working and determined woman. She began sewing at an early age. After finishing school for the day, she used to sew dresses for girls and women of her village. When she graduated from high school, she was unable to attend university because her parents did not have the financial means to pay for her studies, so she was left without post-secondary education. After getting married, she sewed dresses for her female relatives and in-laws free of charge. As she has completed the course \"Get Ahead\" which was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, she now wants to turn her skills into a business. She will provide sewing services out of her home to local citizens, and her sister-in-law will assist her in running the business. Ziyodajon is seeking a loan of 2,000 US dollars to buy a sewing machine. She is waiting for your kindness.

forty two years old, married and has three children.  In order to start providing a source of income for her family, she started a business with livestock.  She began this business with only 5,000 KGS after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Today, it brings in around 17,000 KGS each month from the sale of milk and meat products as well as from the resale of cattle.  She now owns three cows.  With the goal of adding to this number, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 135,000 KGS to buy an additional cow and a horse.  She plans to reinvest the income provided by the loan back into the business by continuing to buy more animals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1311726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a milk cow and a horse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Jilga village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-15T16:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-14T16:50:01Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1372.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1477.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1372.22,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":65558.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013970},{"amount":1477.78,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":70601.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552913}],"funded_date":"2013-03-15T21:30:05Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Blake Griffin","image":1939381}},{"id":537471,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is taking out another Kiva loan of KES 50,000 to boost her business.

She began her business to assist her husband in the running of the home, since her husband's salary is not enough. Her business is located in the outskirts of the city and her main customers are women. Working seven days per week and 16 hours per day, she earns about SLL 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000.

She struggles with financial security.  Financial support will not only help her stay afloat, but will help her children get on their feet.

She resides in Kanibadam. She is married and is raising two children. Her spouse works as a private carpenter in town and this is his main income. Muborak herself is engaged in selling women's clothing and bags in the central market. She started this activity two years ago. At first, she could not manage a very big inventory, but after she found out about lending at Arvand she decided to take a loan to increase her inventory. One of her very first loans helped her very much. During the time she was borrowing from Arvand, she acquired her own store.  \r\n\r\nHoping for a brighter future for her children, she works day and night. With the new loan, Muborak plans bring a new range of women's clothing and to expand her business.

Oksana has her own business. Oksana has a shop and sells products made from wooden rods. She also deals in wedding decorations for rooms and cars. All that she has, she has achieved on her own. Her husband divorced her because of her inability to have children.

","en":"Nurjamal is fifty two years old, married and the mother of two children.  After the collapse of the USSR, she was given a plot of land.  She is the main source of income for her family and has worked with livestock since 1995.  She began her business with 15,000 KGS and thanks to her hard work and perseverance, today she owns one cow and 1.2 hectares of land where she plants beans, potatoes and strawberries each year.  Her business brings in around 180,000 to 200,000 KGS each month.  With the goal of further developing her business, Nurjamal has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 130,000 KGS to buy one cow.  This will allow her to increase her revenue from the sale of milk.  She plans to use what's leftover from the loan to buy sheep to increase her income from reselling animals.  With the funds received next fall she plans to build a new home.
