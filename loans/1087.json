He therefore took the money to finish up his house so that he can be able to reduce his expense for renting.\r\n\r\nHis major challenge is inadequate capital to expand and at the same time buy feed, more pigs to increase their number on his farm and meet the family's needs.\r\n\r\nHis neighbors commend Acleston as very hardworking, determined and a dedicated ambitious farmer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1312413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials to finish his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rubaga Road","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-03-16T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-15T05:10:03Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Acleston","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":505997.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993877},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":505997.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040581},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":505997.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831207},{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1517991.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879730}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T08:55:15Z","paid_date":"2013-10-20T09:19:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":537801,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is a 53-year-old woman who is married with six children.

The main business of her family is animal husbandry and crop growing. In 2011, she decided to get into the area of fattening and re-selling cattle with a start-up capital of 70,000 Kyrgyzstan som (KGS). Today, her farm consists of 3 dairy cows and 1 horse and brings in a monthly income of 15,000 som. For the purpose of further developing her farm, Sairakan has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 115,000 som to purchase cows. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to invest in future expansion her business.

She was educated in a vocational high school. She now sells men's and women's clothing at the central market of her city. Her goal in life is to improve her living conditions, to send her children to a good university, and of course to expand her business. She is very kind, sociable, intelligent and energetic. She began her business in 1995 with a start-up capital of only 1,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Today, she has a turnover of 70,000 Som. For the purpose of further developing her business, Kulnara has now approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 Som to increase her turnover by expanding her range of goods. She will use the income generated by this loan for the future development of her business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1312384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase goods to increase the assortment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul town, Jalalabad region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-16T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-15T06:50:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4630},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4579},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4693},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4811},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4931},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5054},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5180},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5310},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5443},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5369}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.23,"local_amount":4630,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4645.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458963},{"amount":96.16,"local_amount":4579,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4594.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863100},{"amount":98.55,"local_amount":4693,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-28T08:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4708.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631628},{"amount":101.03,"local_amount":4811,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4826.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495528},{"amount":103.55,"local_amount":4931,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4947.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743762},{"amount":214.91,"local_amount":10234,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10267.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013972},{"amount":111.51,"local_amount":5310,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5327.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777048},{"amount":114.3,"local_amount":5443,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5460.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426850},{"amount":112.76,"local_amount":5369,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5386.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552914}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T00:54:15Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":537811,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilyn is 31 years old and has one child.

She is unmarried and has no children. Her brother helps her to run her business. This is the 12th time that Anarkhan has approached our bank for a loan. All her previous loans were used for their intended purposes and were repaid on time without any violations. During her dealings with the bank, she has shown herself to be a responsible and enterprising person, capable of running her business well and investing finances appropriately. She is recognised as a person of authority by her neighbours, colleagues and acquaintances, and enjoys a reputation of being approachable and friendly. Anarkhan also has a stable salary from her job as a leading expert for a social fund. She started her farming business in 1996 with her savings of 8,000 Kyrgyzstan Som. Her farm now consists of 6 head of cattle and cash assets of 6,000 Som. In addition to animal husbandry, she grows cotton on a 1.4 hectare plot of land. For the purpose of further developing her business, Anarkhan has come to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 Som to purchase cows and to plant cotton, corn and clover. She has a small home-based shop that is temporarily closed, and she intends to use the income generated by this loan to renovate it and get it running again. Anarkhan has accumulated many years of business experience and knows the ins and outs. Her long experience and her optimistic attitude to life encourage her to achieve new goals. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1312393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cattle and to prepare for spring field work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Komintren village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-16T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-15T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":291.28,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarkhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":36000},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":42000},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":42000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":757.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":883.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":883.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":730.44,"local_amount":36000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":36190.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.06,"payment_id":459019380},{"amount":775.41,"local_amount":42000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":42221.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":108.34,"payment_id":595435811},{"amount":727.87,"local_amount":42000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":42221.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":155.88,"payment_id":636160926}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T18:30:44Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:41:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":537816,"name":"Mamlakat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamlakat is kind and smart woman.

a very good teacher.  He works at the school in his village, he has 30 years experience and he loves children.  His small salary notwithstanding, Nurmehamed works and teaches his pupils; he is a hard-working man.  He spends his mornings at the school and in the afternoon he raises livestock.  He has a few sheep.  Because of his good location in the village, he decided to raise livestock and earn extra money on which to live.  Nurmehamed has already been raising sheep for a few years.  With this extra work, he is building a house and kitchen on his plot of land.  The money from his livestock business helps him with his building work.  As Nurmehamed says himself, \"not all at once, but little by little the sale of each sheep helps the building project and I hope that soon I can finish the bedroom and kitchen for my wife.\"  At the moment, Nurmehamed needs extra money.  He wants to buy small lambs and feed for them.  With this goal in mind, he has turned to Arvand and he hopes that he will find support and the resolution to his problems."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1312038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-03-16T09:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-15T09:50:07Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" \u041d\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":325.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":332.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":342.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":332.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325.1,"local_amount":325.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":325.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774270},{"amount":332.87,"local_amount":332.87,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":332.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673408},{"amount":342.03,"local_amount":342.03,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":342.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144209}],"funded_date":"2013-03-19T04:01:01Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:36:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":537828,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma is 46 years old and married with five children, one of whom is in school.

","en":"Aigul is a 37-year-old wife and mother of four. She has worked in a bakery for many years, but she cannot feed her family on this income alone. Hence, she has also worked in crop farming for 15 years. Her initial investment in this business was 15,000 som. Thanks to persistent work Aigul is able to rent a 3 hectare plot of land where she plants beans.

She is from Managua. She is single and a mother with one child, who is an adult now. She works in sales, selling clothes and tortillas. \r\n\r\nDue to her economic situation she was only able to complete her 5th year of secondary education.\r\n\r\nShe started her small business at 19 years old. She needed a way to support herself and to be independent, with a means of generating income herself. At the start it was difficult because she sold very few clothes and shoes. Then she decided to set up another business selling tortillas in order to earn some extra income. At present, together with her daughter, they have managed to keep the business stable. \r\n\r\nThe earnings she has made from the business have enabled her to make improvements to her house. She has other sources of income, such as money that one brother sends her.\r\n\r\nYelba is requesting this finance to buy flipflops, shorts and swimsuits, and also to buy corn and firewood. She considers that the loan will be of great help to her because it will enable her to buy all the products that she does not have in stock, with the aim of increasing her sales and meeting her customers\u2019 needs. Her future plans include expanding her business to obtain better earnings. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1313026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy flipflops, shorts and swimsuits, and also to buy maize and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-03-16T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-15T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yelba Meyling \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573391},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373166074},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971887},{"amount":84.51,"local_amount":84.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837254},{"amount":82.15,"local_amount":82.15,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":82.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860545},{"amount":583.35,"local_amount":583.35,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":583.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349247}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T11:29:28Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:00:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Carey","image":1216324}},{"id":538191,"name":"Adilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adilia, de 45 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada con Alejandro quien se dedica al transporte y es padre de sus hijos.

It\u2019s located about two kilometres from their house, and they walk there every day.\r\n\r\nNow Marta is seeking a loan to buy fertilizer and manure for the coffee plants as the product they use is expensive and difficult to acquire. Her goal is to have her fields produce more and keep the plants healthy so that she can earn more money. Then she will be able to reinvest in the coffee fields; this is the only means she has of earning money to support her family.\r\n\r\nMarta\u2019s dream is to see her children graduate from university so that they can have a better standard of living, more income, and benefit from the effort that their parents put in today on the land.

She worked from an early age because financial need did not allow her to continue preparing for high school. She was born in Pelileo where she finished primary school, but later she left that city looking for better opportunities. She has two children, one of whom is an adult and has an independent life and the other lives under her care and is a student.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Dolores is single and has given her children education and support, thanks to her daily work and efforts. Currently she lives with her younger son in the parish of Chig\u00fcilpe, some 15 minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, the capital city of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a place that has an active trade as it has become a land port of exchange between the mountain ranges and the coast of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThis parish has several houses of cement and of wood mixed with cement. It has a much visited river where tourists and residents practice various sports and they have the opportunity of getting to know the culture of Ts\u00e1chila through legends related to visitors at campfires. Santo Domingo is the third most populous city of the region, and also contributes in the areas of agriculture, livestock, fishing and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Dolores took advantage of her talent for preparing delicious typical food, and opened a food stand outside her home 14 years ago. Many of her customers recommend her in the neighborhood, as the flavors are delicious and all of her dishes, stuffed potato patties served with peanut sauce, slow roasted pork, and grilled beef tripes, etc., are greatly desired dishes all over Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThis woman has had problems with her stove. She has been working for many years every day from the early hours of morning until after the sun goes down, and she has maintained it, but all the same, she believes that everything would be better with a new stove.\r\n\r\nWhen she wanted to go ahead with the work, she could not find easy financing, as there are many hoops to jump through in order to be granted credit. In this search she found Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who with the help of Kiva could grant her a loan which will be part of the growth of her business and so Mar\u00eda Dolores enriches her quality of life and that of her daughter. Upon hearing about Kiva\u2019s methodology she expressed her thankfulness and sent many greetings and blessings to people around the world making dreams possible for so many micro-entrepreneurs like her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1313029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a new industrial gas stove for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-16T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-15T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":516.8,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.17,"local_amount":78.92,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":80.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494997},{"amount":85.71,"local_amount":84.37,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":85.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133230},{"amount":87.12,"local_amount":85.76,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":87.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313769},{"amount":89.01,"local_amount":87.62,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":89.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565374},{"amount":123.8,"local_amount":121.87,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":123.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814414},{"amount":59.19,"local_amount":58.26,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":59.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320588}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T18:37:10Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":538544,"name":"Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Javier es casado y tiene dos hijos, uno de ellos est\u00e1 en edad escolar, viven en casa de los suegros de Javier, la casa se encuentra ubicada en la zona Rio Seco  de la ciudad de El Alto.\nJavier estudi\u00f3 hasta el nivel secundario, y con  su esposa se dedican al armado de shorts deportivos, ellos reciben  cada semana ciertas cantidades de telas para su respectivo armado.\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo requiere para  adquirir una maquina cortadora para acelerar su trabajo.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Javier es equipar su taller de costura con m\u00e1s maquinas y convertirse en un microempresario.\nEs la segunda vez que solicita cr\u00e9dito junto a IMPRO y la primera vez con KIVA.\n","en":"Javier is married and has two children.

Nubrah is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kiyinda in Uganda. For the past year, Nubrah has been working hard to manage her small business selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Nubrah has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock more T-shirts and trousers to sell and it will help Nubrah to generate greater profits and own another business in another center. Nubrah hopes that in the future, she will be able to pay fees for her young sister. \r\n\r\nNubrah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia with her 54-year-old husband and two sons (Erekle and Tsotne). Nearly everybody works in the family, but together they all only make a small monthly income. Khatuna is working privately as a babysitter, her husband has a car and is a taxi driver, and her younger son is working on a fuel station. \r\n\r\nKhatuna requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time, because of their low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nKhatuna has now requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the credit she has received, Khatuna will rent a space to open a food court where they make Turkish Donners, and will purchase a special mounting for it. She wants to employ her son Tsotne, and they will both set up the family business. Tukish Donner is very popular in Tbilisi and Khatuna will rent a place in the crowded area, where she hopes her business will be profitable. All of the family members will then be employed, and their income will significantly grow. The profit will give them opportunity to have better living conditions.

The community is adjacent to the boundaries of Michoac\u00e1n State in Mexico. It is not very easy to access the community, because there is almost no transportation to the town and one has to walk to catch the microbus that passes by. Don Tomas is part of a group called Las Palomas ('The Doves'). He says it is the first time he has joined a lending group. He is asking for this loan because he has a small grocery and supply store in his community, and would like to stock the store using this money. Every week he goes to the town of Zitacuaro to buy vegetables and other items to sell so his store is well-stocked and customers in his community do not have to waste their time traveling to get what they need. Don Tomas says he will use the loan money to buy tomatoes, chile peppers, onions, potatoes, eggs, beans, rice, chocolate, sugar, salt, matches, light bulbs, cooking oil, soups, soft drinks, plantains, toilet paper, tuna, sardines, chiles in vinegar, and other necessities. The credit will help him improve his business, which is the only well-stocked store in the community. His dream is to make his shop a little bigger so that the products fit better. The other members of his lending group are called Virginia, Susana, Angelina, Maria Regina, Fernanda, Carmen, Celia, Bulmaro, Esperanza, and Marcia. They will invest their portions of the loan money in items for their businesses, such as buying a horse for working plots of land, purchasing sheep and food for the sheep, buying a cow for milking, and buying men's and women's clothing, sweets, and other items for sale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":1313067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

The family resides in their own house on fenced land. He has been running an automobile repair shop for seven consecutive years. In wintertime, the number of customers decreases drastically, so he produces and sells cookers to local people. The automobile repair shop he owns has been heated by a low pressure heater and the authority of Darkhan city requested he install a central heating system for energy efficiency. So, Mr. Janchiv is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 tugriks to install a central heating system in his automobile repair shop.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the installment of a heating system is that it offers a more environmentally-friendly solution than a direct electric heating device. This stems from the fact that most electricity originates remotely using fossil fuels, with up to two-thirds of the energy in the fuel lost at the power station and in transmission losses. Typical efficiencies for central heating are: 85-97% for gas-fired heating; 80-89% for oil-fired, and 45-60% for coal-fired heating. Based on these facts, installment of a heating system in the automobile repair shop will enable Mr. Janchiv to spend less on energy

She is married with one child. Teresa has run a variety store for more than 10 years. She is thankful because her perseverance and patience resulted in a little success.\r\n\r\nTeresa's previous loans helped her a lot, most especially in improving her financial stability and way of life.

She is married to Constantino, a driver, and is a mother to her children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEditha owns and oversees operations of their Jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one Jeepney unit (14-16 person capacity), which are paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her Jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nEditha dreams to have more jeepneys and hopes that her grandchildren will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that truly makes the Philippines the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1313165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

","en":"Roza is a 61-year-old widow. Her son and granddaughter live with her. For the last 15 years, Roza has been working in animal husbandry and growing crops, having started this business with a sum of 15,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, her farm now includes 4 head of cattle and 13 sheep, and the monthly income from the sale of milk, dairy products, and cattle is 10,000 Som. In addition, she also plants potatoes every year and grows grains on a 5.31 hectare plot of land. For the purpose of developing her business, Roza has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 65,000 Som to purchase cattle for fattening and re-sale. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to further increase the number of domestic cattle she has.

He is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who together with his wife put all their efforts into getting their family ahead in life. Unfortunately due to a lack of financial resources and because he had to start working from a very young age, Luis was unable to pursue the professional studies in Mechanical Engineering.

Now, he is very well-known and has a good customer base. Occasionally he helps other mechanics, when necessary, paying them for their work. Sandro does not have to pay rent for his business because he works out of his home. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting this loan in order to buy paint thinner, putty, paint and other materials to paint a sedan. This is an important investment for Sandro because he will be able to sell the car he paints for a good price.\r\n\r\nSandro is very happy to receive this loan so soon and he plans to expand his business in the future, buying better tools to work with.
