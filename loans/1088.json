His shop is well known in the region since it opened in 1980, but he took over from his father in 2000 and is working hard to develop it.\r\n\r\nHis business is going just fine but, as most of the businesses in Lebanon, it requires an external push, which he used to request from Al Majmoua, to add a special item to his shop. Through the previous loans, Elias turned the shop from a only a convenience shop to a money transfer shop and international call center, selling stationary and magazines. In addition he sells mobile phones and prepaid cards.\r\n\r\nThis diversity in his business attracts additional customers every day and attracts customers' attention when they are in his shop.\r\n\r\nToday, Elias is applying for his third loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua. This Youth Loan will increase his business merchandise through buying special requested items and increasing special offered products, which attract customers attention.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to keep on expanding his business and to be capable of moving to a better and wider place in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1313449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Youth","Arab Youth"],"use":"to increase his business merchandise with special requested items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Dora","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-03-17T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-16T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":102,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":241.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":267.2,"local_amount":267.2,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":267.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355736028},{"amount":316.6,"local_amount":316.6,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":316.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364441419},{"amount":315.6,"local_amount":315.6,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":315.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846648},{"amount":279.2,"local_amount":279.2,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":279.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614877},{"amount":315.6,"local_amount":315.6,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":315.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390472379},{"amount":315.6,"local_amount":315.6,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":315.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728473},{"amount":990.2,"local_amount":990.2,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":990.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997404}],"funded_date":"2013-03-23T17:25:36Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T09:14:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Narindra-Dastoor","image":153719}},{"id":538421,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is 29 years old.

No tuvo posibilidad de pagar sus estudios universitarios, por lo que decidi\u00f3 autosustentarse instalando una tienda en el barrio donde vive con surtido suficiente para ganar varios clientes de la zona. Kerly vive en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nKerly ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para poder comprar una waflera y licuadora que le ayudar\u00e1n a ofrecer otros productos en su negocio para aquellas personas que no les qued\u00f3 tiempo para desayunar en casa y puedan pasar por el negocio de Kerly sirvi\u00e9ndose un jugo o un delicioso sanduche preparado en waflera. En muchas instituciones financieras se cerraron las puertas para obtener un cr\u00e9dito y poder financiar este crecimiento de su negocio, sin embargo, Kerly no se ha dado por vencida y en busca de mejorar su estilo de vida e incluso en un futuro retomar sus estudios, ha encontrado una instituci\u00f3n que gracias a la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva puede apoyarle en sus sue\u00f1os sin poner muchas trabas y haciendo part\u00edcipes a varias personas alrededor del mundo. Para Kerly es muy importante que su negocio crezca para que su vida mejore y tambi\u00e9n pueda aprovechar el esp\u00edritu emprendedor muy caracter\u00edstico de los habitantes de Santo Domingo. ","en":"Kerly is a young woman, hardly 18 years old, who has just finished her secondary education in public school. Paying for university studies wasn\u2019t possible, so she decided to support herself by setting up a store in the neighborhood where she lives. She has enough merchandise to win over some customers in the area. \r\n\r\nKerly lives in the R\u00edo Verde parish in Santo Domingo, which is the capital city of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. This province in Ecuador has had a high level of sustained growth in recent years. The capital city\u2019s most attractive features are its delicious fruits and its local cuisine. It also has a considerable amount of trade since it has become an inland port for trade between the mountainous and coastal regions of the country. In addition, it has many tourist attractions that, coupled with its warm climate, are very busy with both national and international tourists. Because of this, most of the inhabitants have set up commercial businesses or services for inhabitants and tourists. \r\n\r\nKerly has requested a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to be able to purchase a waffle iron and a blender that would allow her to offer more products in her business. People that don\u2019t have time to eat breakfast at home can come by Kerly\u2019s business to have juice or a delicious sandwich prepared with the waffle iron. A lot of financial institutions have closed their doors to the possibility of giving her a loan to finance the growing of her business. Nevertheless, Kerly has not given up. Looking to improve her quality of life, including in the future taking up her studies again, she has found the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa. Thanks to Kiva, the foundation involves many people around the world and supports her dreams without putting many obstacles in the way. For Kerly it is very important that her business grow so that her life can improve and so she can take advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit that characterizes the people of Santo Domingo. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1313657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase a waffle iron and a blender to offer new kinds of food in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-17T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-16T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kerly Mishell","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":413.44,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":67.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.91,"local_amount":63.14,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":64.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524926},{"amount":69.39,"local_amount":67.51,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":69.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133231},{"amount":70.53,"local_amount":68.61,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":70.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313770},{"amount":72.06,"local_amount":70.1,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":72.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565375},{"amount":73.35,"local_amount":71.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":73.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814415},{"amount":74.76,"local_amount":72.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":74.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320589}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T18:36:31Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":538436,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah lives in West Point, one of the most populated and well-known markets in Montserrado County that is good at producing fish for the Liberian market.

He lives in the town of Pisco with his wife and their two small children, whom he loves very dearly, and who are his main reason for living. He is very nice, hard-working, and enthusiastic. Together with his wife, they do everything in their power to make ends meet. Unfortunately, due to his economic situation and the need to start working at a very young age, Alfredo was unable to study business management, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to listen to music, and sometimes cooks a delicious chicken dish called 'seco de pollo', which he shares with his family. On his own initiative, sparing no efforts, and with admirable dedication, Alfredo works in his own tiny shop that sells cleaning products. He also sells drinks at his house. He works every day for about ten hours and attributes his success to his amiability towards customers. Alfredo is very grateful to Kiva lenders, since, thanks to their help, he will be able to buy a small stall at his town's central market. He hopes this will help him attract more customers and keep working towards his great dream of expanding his

He is single, and lives in the town of Ca\u00f1ete, in the district of Imperial. He is a very nice, hard-working, and enthusiastic person, who always wants to do his best. Unfortunately, due to his economic situation and the need to start working at a very young age, Willian was unable to study information technology, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to play football with his friends, and sometimes cooks a delicious chicken-and-rice dish called 'arroz con pollo', which he shares with his family. On his own initiative, sparing no efforts, and with admirable dedication, Willian works as a labourer on a farm in his town. He also has a small business of his own: he raises and sells rabbits. He works every day for about twelve hours and attributes his success to his efforts and his amiability towards other people. Willian is very grateful to Kiva lenders, since, thanks to their help, he will be able to build an adequate enclosure for his rabbits. To this end, he will buy cane, wooden sticks, and wire mesh. He hopes this will help him raise and sell more rabbits and keep working towards his great dream of learning a profession and improving his lot in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1313809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to build an enclosure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-17T20:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-16T20:20:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Willian Raul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.89,"local_amount":76.08,"processed_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":77.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483374},{"amount":31.09,"local_amount":79.15,"processed_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":80.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889409},{"amount":32.06,"local_amount":81.61,"processed_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664309},{"amount":33.65,"local_amount":85.65,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":87.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775651},{"amount":34.81,"local_amount":88.6,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":90.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779043},{"amount":113.5,"local_amount":288.91,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":294.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054222}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T20:44:05Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":538479,"name":"Patricial","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricial, a 25 year old lady, lives in West Point, one of the most populated and well known market areas in Montserrado county.

His loan request was approved via the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. With the received credit, Tengiz will purchase a metal protective grid used for smoking fish. The demand for smoked fish is high in the villages, so Tengiz hopes his business will be profitable.

Unfortunately, due to his economic situation and the need to start working at a very young age, Pedro was unable to learn a profession, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to listen to music, and sometimes cooks a delicious lamb dish called 'seco de cordero', which he shares with his family. On his own initiative, sparing no efforts, and with admirable dedication, Pedro works as a taxi driver in his town. He works every day for about twelve hours and attributes his success to his knowledge of where to find fares. Alfredo is very grateful to Kiva lenders, since, thanks to their help, he will be able to perform maintenance on his taxi, such as changing the tires and the shock absorbers. This will help him keep working towards his great dream of having his own taxi company."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1313812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to perform maintenance on his taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-17T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-16T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":67.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":69.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":98.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":103.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.18,"local_amount":67.96,"processed_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":70.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483375},{"amount":27.74,"local_amount":69.35,"processed_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":71.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889410},{"amount":28.39,"local_amount":70.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":73.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664310},{"amount":60.84,"local_amount":152.09,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":157.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775653},{"amount":255.85,"local_amount":639.63,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":663.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779044}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T00:52:25Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":538669,"name":"Ramon","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ram\u00f3n, tiene un negocio de venta de frutas y verduras.

She raises livestock as the main source of income for her family.  She started this business with 15,000 som (KGS) in 1992, after the fall of the USSR, so she could improve her family's finances.  Today she has a good farm with a dairy cow, sheep and goats.  With the income she has earned from raising livestock, Nasira has created good conditions in which to raise her animals, and she built an extension to her house.

Her loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family owns an agricultural plot of land where they grow maize, nuts, plums, tomatoes, and apples. The harvested fruits and vegetables are sold locally at the markets, providing a small income for living. \r\n\r\nTinatin requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program has a provision for business start-up and re-startup with credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tinatin will purchase a milk cow. She will milk the cow to make dairy and milk products which will be sold locally at the markets and significantly grow the family income. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Tinatin wants to reinvest profit in the same business to purchase more cows and develop her farming.

donde siempre le inculcaron el valor del trabajo honesto y esforzado. Pudo estudiar hasta terminar la escuela secundaria y est\u00e1 separado de su esposa con quien tuvo 3 hijos que a ra\u00edz de la separaci\u00f3n dejaron de vivir con \u00e9l, pero Jhony no los ha descuidado ni un solo d\u00eda, dos de ellos tienen 8 a\u00f1os y el tercero tiene casi 3 a\u00f1os. Este hombre trabajador ahora vive solo en el Cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. \nJhony desde que sali\u00f3 del colegio trabaj\u00f3 como empleado en el sector de la agricultura y en la crianza de cerdos, de estas experiencias aprendi\u00f3 la actividad a la cual se dedica desde hace 10 a\u00f1os en su terreno. Todas las ma\u00f1anas se dedica a la limpieza de las chancheras y la alimentaci\u00f3n de los cerdos y las tardes visita a sus hijos o va a la feria de animales a ofertar sus chanchos y adem\u00e1s a recolectar el alimento para sus animales. A pesar de que la separaci\u00f3n de su c\u00f3nyuge le afect\u00f3 y frustr\u00f3 mucho, Jhony sigui\u00f3 trabajo con el sue\u00f1o de un d\u00eda ver a sus 3 hijos convertidos en profesionales de excelencia como el no pudo llegar a ser. Es su primer cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y est\u00e1 muy satisfecho con la confianza, asesor\u00eda y eficiente gesti\u00f3n que le brindaron, principalmente porque han contado con el producto Kiva. Con este cr\u00e9dito, realizar\u00e1 la ampliaci\u00f3n de los criaderos para una mejor crianza de los cerdos y tambi\u00e9n para poder traer m\u00e1s cerdo y as\u00ed incrementar sus ventas.  Jhony agradece a quienes aportan la financiaci\u00f3n de este crecimiento laboral que adem\u00e1s aportar\u00e1 para que pueda empezar la construcci\u00f3n de su casa propia. ","en":"Jhony is a 30-year-old man. He grew up in a home with limited resources where the value of honest and hard work was always instilled in him. He was able to study until the end of his secondary education, and he is separated from his wife with whom he had three children. Since the separation, the children no longer live with him, but Jhony has not neglected them for a single day. Two of them are 8 years old and the third is barely 3 years old.\r\n\r\nThis hardworking man now lives by himself in the canton Santo Domingo of the province Santo Domingo in Tsachilas. Santo Domingo connects the mountainous region with the coastal region of Ecuador, and is a city that has become a commercial center with several growing sectors. It contains various enterprising families that started small businesses some years ago and now are microbusiness owners that support a generation of employment. Studies show that most of the businesses began empirically and have grown with the passage of tourists, businesspeople and travelers that move from one region to another and in addition it is the third most populated city in the country.\r\n\r\nJhony since leaving school worked as a laborer in the agricultural sector raising pigs. From these experiences he learned the activity which he has devoted himself to for 10 years on his land. Every morning he bathes and feeds the pigs and in the afternoons he visits his children or goes to the animal market to sell his pigs and in addition to pick up feed for his animals.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the separation from his wife which affected him and frustrated him greatly, Jhony continued working with the dream of one day seeing his three children becoming professionals of excellence, as he failed to become one.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan from Fundacion Alternativa and he is very happy with the trust, consulting and efficient management that they offer him, principally because they could depend on Kiva loans. With this loan, he will expand the nursery to improve the growth of the pigs and also to be able to bring more pigs and thereby grow his sales. Jhony is grateful to those who support the financing of his job growth that will also help him to begin construction of his own house.

Bayramali also has a garden, where he raises seasonal fruits and vegetables.  His wife is a housekeeper, and she looks after the house and helps her husband to look after the sheep. \r\n\r\nThe village where Bayramali lives is located in the southern part of Azerbaijan, with very rigorous climate conditions. In summer, the temperature reaches 105 degrees, Fahrenheit, and the main problem in the region is water for irrigation and for animals.  Bayramali is not able to build a water channel for his garden and animals, by himself. This is quite an expensive process, which requires a labor force and special equipment.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard about water loans, he was extremely excited and applied for a 2,000 AZN loan. He will use this loan to pay for special equipment, like tractors, and for workers who will dig the land, to make a water channel. He is a trustworthy client of AqroInvest and has a good client history.

Shukur says that the year-to-year climate has become more vigorous than previous years, with especially hot summers and cold winters. In the summer, temperatures reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit, and the main problem in the region is water for irrigation. People are suffering and order special cars with water to irrigate crops, especially in summertime, when temperatures reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nRaising crops has been his life project for the last four years, and this business brings him stable income, his only financial resource. Shukur is not able to build a water channel for his garden alone. This is quite an expensive process that requires a labor force and special equipment. When he heard about water loans, he was extremely excited and applied for a 2000 AZN (Azerbaijani new manat) loan. He will use this loan to pay for the rental of special equipment like a tractor for making the water channel and for workers who will dig the

He worked his way up from associate to assistant manager, and then to a manager\u2019s position. While working at the state prison, Jose decided to open his own jewelry store, but after 15 years, health issues forced him to close. When he got better, he embarked on a new entrepreneurial venture: a tobacco shop.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked for the state for 18 years. I\u2019ve already worked for someone else all my life.  I want to work for myself,\u201d Jose says. His main goal is to expand his business and retire. \r\n\r\nHis new business, Blue Frog, is a tobacco smoke shop, which sells a variety of tobacco products, pipes and incense.  \r\n\r\nBlue Frog is open seven days a week and closes late at 10 p.m. The shop carries all types of tobacco products, incense, and pipes. \r\n\r\nOriginally from Edinburg, Texas, Jose followed his dream and moved to nearby McAllen, where he says rent is more affordable. He says he found a shop close to downtown and is paying half of what he would have elsewhere. Though the shop has only been open for a month now, Jose says a competitor has already offered to buy him out. He says, \u201cFrom what I heard from customers, my store is a lot cleaner. It\u2019s the way we have it set up compared to the other stores that makes it different.\u201d\r\n\r\nA returning client of Accion Texas Inc, Jose remembered the microlender when looking for a loan, which he is using to purchase inventory. \u201cI invested $8,000 to connect the light and water and I bought merchandise myself, but I needed more inventory. When I knew I needed a little more, I went to Accion,\u201d he says. Without the loan, \u201cI would have been stuck for a while. The merchandise that the customers were asking for, we didn\u2019t have. Without the loan, I would still be waiting on the merchandise.\u201d \r\n\r\nJose runs his business while still holding down his job at the prison.  And he has one employee to help. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about this business,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in retail before and now that I found someone to sell wholesale to me, I can

saw an opportunity to expand on an already-made business that has a large clientele. \r\n\r\nCarlos says the previous owner was moving onto other projects.  \u201cHe pretty much forwarded me the company. I figured that it was good, the business is already built, and the clientele is already there,\u201d he says.  \u201cI called some of my partners who went to work at different companies and offered them to team up; they all agreed. The whole idea was to keep the solid team.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor Carlos, the move was a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d He says the hardest work was rebranding the company name in 2009, but even that wasn\u2019t too complicated. \r\n\r\nInnova Digital Systems, located in Carlos\u2019 hometown of El Paso, Texas, is an information technology outsourcing company that works with other companies and nonprofits on providing telecommunications installation, computer repairs, network assistance, and cabling, wireless, theft and maintenance services, as well as security, firewalls, email hosting, and web design. \r\n\r\n\u201cAnything that you can think of for your business, we do it,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cWe basically become a client\u2019s IT department. Or if the client has an IT department, we act as their consultants. We have more than 75 years of combined experience.\u201d In addition to his experience in information technology, Carlos has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business from the University of North Texas.\r\n\r\nThe seven-member team consists of three partners and four engineers, who constantly work out of the office, in the field. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a tech geek,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cThat goes back to my college days. I was going for computer information systems, which allowed me to get a business administration background. All in all, it was a good move and opened a lot of possibilities.\u201d Since taking ownership of the company, and re-opening the business three years ago, Carlos moved it to a different location and gained more clients. \r\n\r\nConsidering his operating expenses, purchasing and payroll costs, and money needed for projects while waiting for payments from clients, Carlos decided to seek financing. Remembering his uncle\u2019s mention of Accion Texas Inc. years ago, Carlos attended one of Accion\u2019s seminars and met a loan officer. He says after that meeting, he felt comfortable returning to the office to apply for a loan, which he says, \u201ckeeps us on track to reach our sales goals and increase profits.\u201d \r\n\r\nWithout Accion\u2019s help, Carlos says, \u201cWe would have had to pay real high interest rates on credit cards to fill those expenses. Our margins would have been cut and we wouldn\u2019t have as much business as we do now.\u201d  He says he plans to hire more engineers soon. \u201cOur plans are to grow as much as possible,\u201d Carlos says, adding that he plans to expand slowly and carefully.  \r\n\r\nHe\u2019ll hire only one additional engineer in 2013.  He is also looking to hire someone to manage advertising and social media promotion.\r\nTo learn more about his business, check out his website at www.idselpaso.com.

In the summer, the temperature can reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit.  The main problem in the region is water for irrigation and for the animals.  Hudi is not able to build a water channel for his garden alone.  This is quite an expensive process which requires a labor force and special equipment.  When he heard about water loans he was extremely excited and applied for a 2,000 AZN loan.  He will use this loan to pay for the water channel to be dug (including a tractor and

She started her business quite a while ago when she got a small severance payment 3 years ago.  Now she works every day, selling on the basis of orders and at times selling her products and cosmetics on credit.\r\n\r\nShe has not had any difficulty with the business, nor does she expect it in the future.  She is not married; she's single and has no children.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Johanna wants to buy cosmetics, creams, perfumes, and other products.

In the summer, temperatures can reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit.  The main problem in the region is water for irrigation and animals.  Mulkadar is not able to build a water channel for his animals alone.  This is quite an expensive process which requires a labor force and special equipment.  When he heard about water loans he was extremely excited and applied for a 2,000 AZN loan.  He will use this loan to build the water channel, including tractor rental and paying for

42 years old and married. She has 6 children, the oldest of whom is 17 years old. Buraima's husband, and her children when they have free time from school, help her with the business. Currently Buraima raises animals and farms. She began the business from practically nothing 20 years ago. Her monthly income is around 15,000-18,000 KGS. She has a very honest and goal oriented personality. Everything that she has achieved is thanks to her diligence.

She lives in the city of Konibodom. She was married, but unfortunately her husband passed away several years ago. Zebo has two children. She faces great hardship as she bears all the responsibility for her children and herself, but she does not get discouraged, and she works tirelessly. Zebo has a higher education, but does not work in her area of expertise since she cannot support her children on one salary. She works in sales of dried fruit, a business she has been in for the past 15 years. She buys goods in another city. This is her sole source of income. Her children help her when they are not in school. On the advice of friends, Zebo decided to apply for a loan, and turned to Arvand. She plans to use the loan to buy dried fruit from a different city and sell it at a higher price. She very much hopes that this loan will help her expand her business and adequately support her children.

","en":"Sadridin is 27 years old, married, and has two children.  After graduating from secondary school, he could not continue his education because he needed to help his family.  He has a large family made up of 6 people.  Sadridin is the oldest son.  His father is a Jack of all trades, does not have a formal job, and spends much time at the employment office.  It is difficult for Sadridin, as he not only needs to help his brothers and sisters get on their feet, but also his parents.  A few years ago, he found work as a baker.  He likes this job and and would very much like to continue on in the profession.  One year ago, Sadridin opened his own, small bakery out of his home from which he receives a good return from selling his cakes.  Now he has plans to open an actual store from which to sell his baked goods since space is a bit tight at home.  He needs funds to do this.  Sadridin has turned to Arvand for a loan.  He will use the funds to buy all the necessary products (i .e. sacks of flour, butter) for baking.  He hopes that his future income will allow him to build his own bakery near his home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1313287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy

She finished Tokent High School in the Toktogul region in 1983.  She married in 1985 and has 4 sons with her husband.  Kulpotkan currently works with livestock, offering basic services to her clients when she and her family go to pasture for the summer with their cattle.  Each season, the income from services rendered is between 50,000 to 90,000 KGS.  She has also bred cattle since 1999.  At the same time, Kulpotkan also farms; her husband and sons help her with her work.  She has practical experience with livestock, but also theoretical skills.  She treats her responsibilities with great respect.  She now owns 2 cows, 1 calf, 20 sheep and has a small barn where she has everything needed to keep livestock.  Kulpotkan has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy sheep and

Naema looks forward to completing her studies and finding a job so she is able to buy new home appliances for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1314437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to buy a PC to help her with her studies at university.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2013-03-18T10:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-17T10:30:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Afrah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Najeiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":160000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16108},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15988},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15988},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15988},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15988},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15988},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15988},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":15988},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15988},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15988}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150.45,"local_amount":32096,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":32290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364442734},{"amount":599.55,"local_amount":127904,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":128678.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372847944}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T12:27:54Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:04:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C Pettersen"}},{"id":538831,"name":"Justine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justine is a resident of Mombasa, Kenya.

She was born into a very humble family and, as a result, has always worked hard farming corn and beans.  Her parents also taught her how to weave 'petates' (bedrolls) and raise pigs.\r\n\r\nEladia's parents died and she got married at the age of 18.  She has one daughter from her marriage who is now an adult.  These days Eladia only lives with her husband.  She is always hard at work weaving 'petates', fattening pigs and doing farm work.  In addition, she also sells lotions, lingerie, creams and other types of beauty products.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy the palm fibers she needs for weaving her petates, Eladia has to walk along mountain paths because there is no public transport service where she lives.

This involves a twenty minute bus journey.\r\n\r\nEladia is requesting this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy wood, tiles and canes so that she can improve her home as the existing wood is in a bad state of repair.

Bol\u00edvar, pero cambi\u00f3 su domicilio desde muy joven por el trabajo de sus padres, tuvo varios obst\u00e1culos en sus estudios y por los escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos termin\u00f3 solo la escuela primaria. Se cas\u00f3 muy joven y se dedic\u00f3 a los quehaceres del hogar y fue muy triste para ella no poder tener hijos. \u00c9ste y otros motivos fueron la causa de su divorcio que fue una etapa muy dif\u00edcil de sobrellevar. Sin embargo esta mujer ejemplar ha salido adelante y ahora vive en el Cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. \nEsther desde hace 6 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos y art\u00edculos para el hogar. La mayor\u00eda de sus clientes son mujeres. Con las ventas ella gana premios de art\u00edculos que le sirven para uso personal. Dedica varias horas cada d\u00eda en la ma\u00f1ana y en la tarde recorriendo las largas calles de su ciudad para tomar los pedidos de sus clientes, ofrecer los productos y realizar cobranzas de sus ventas anteriores. Ahora requiere un cr\u00e9dito que lo utilizar\u00e1 en compra de mercader\u00eda al por mayor y de esta forma podr\u00e1 obtener mayor descuento y as\u00ed ofrecer precios competitivos a sus clientes. Con los ingresos extras que se generen, Esther pagar\u00e1 algunas deudas y adem\u00e1s realizar\u00e1 arreglos que su casa necesita tanto en la fachada como en las instalaciones del interior. Gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva le ayudar\u00e1n a financiar este sue\u00f1o, ella se siente tranquila, pues adem\u00e1s de recibir un buen trato, su ejecutivo le ha asesorado y le ha brindado agilidad y confianza con el tr\u00e1mite. Esther dice a todas las personas que alrededor del mundo colaboran para financiar sue\u00f1os, que sigan creyendo en la gente, porque cuando dejen de creer se podr\u00e1n perder muchos emprendedores. ","en":"Esther, who is 62, was originally from Bol\u00edvar in the north of Ecuador but moved away from there on account of her parents' work.  She faced a number of obstacles during her education and, as money was tight, received only a primary education.  She married young and became a housewife  but, to her distress, was not able to have children.  For this and other reasons, she and her husband divorced, and this proved a difficult time.  However, this inspirational woman has risen above it all and now lives in Santo Domingo Canton in Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province.  The city of Santo Domingo lies between Ecuador's mountain region and the coast and has become a commercial hub with various growth industries. Proof of this can be seen in the number of enterprising families who set up small business a few years ago and now are microentrepreneurs who play their part in generating employment.  Studies show that a hands-on approach was employed in the setting-up of these businesses which have been well-received by the tourists, business people and travellers who travel between regions.  Furthermore, Santo Domingo is the third most populous city in the country.  For the last 6 years, Esther has sold cosmetics and household items, chiefly to women.  Her sales earn her bonuses in the form of toiletries and other items for her own use.  She spends several hours each morning and afternoon walking around her city's long streets taking orders from her customers, promoting her products and collecting payments for previous sales.  She is now requesting a loan which she will use to buy merchandise in bulk.  This will enable her to qualify for a bigger discount, and, as a result, offer competitive prices to her customers.  With the extra income, Esther will pay off some debts and, in addition, will  have much-needed repairs carried out on the exterior and interior fittings of her home.  Thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who, via Kiva, will help her finance this dream, she feels calm because, in addition to being well treated, she has been assessed by her officer, who has instilled in her agility and confidence in dealing with official procedures.  Esther asks all those, the world over, who work together to finance dreams, to continue believing in people because, if they stop believing, many entrepreneurs could be lost."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1313854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She had seven children whom she raised and to whom she has provided an education so that they could become independent.  She lives in a home of her own, along with her husband, Arturo who provides her the strength to move forward.  Maria\u2019s work consists of selling second hand clothing for women, men, and children.  She buys all of her merchandise in the mall in town and takes it to the surrounding zones and districts.\r\n\r\nShe began doing this because of her husband\u2019s idea and initiative more than five years ago.  Things have been going well with her work although her work is sometimes a bit difficult because of the trips she makes and because she has to carry her merchandise herself but she knows that she has to put forth the maximum effort in order to be able to maximize her earnings.  Even though she makes many sales, she would like to maximize her earnings and sell in large volume, so she wants to keep working and grow her business.

He is married and lives with his wife, 3 children (5, 14 and 16 years old) and his mother in the Terjola District. His mother is provided with a retirement pension. Ioseb requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from their agricultural business. They have a pig, a calf and two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese production.  They also have 0.8 hectares of agricultural land and a vineyard with 800 samples of grapevines. They harvest grapes and make wine for selling. The income is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIoseb requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Ioseb will build a shed for chicks. After the shed is built he will be able to purchase chicks and raise them for selling, and thereby increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1315098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to build a shed for chicks, and then buy chicks and raise them for selling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Alisubani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-18T16:50:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-17T16:50:41Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ioseb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":136.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":147.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150.19},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":155.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":158.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":169.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":173.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":178.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":183.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":188.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":194.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.59,"local_amount":136.48,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":138.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570380},{"amount":90.46,"local_amount":147.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":150.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969013},{"amount":91.99,"local_amount":150.19,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":152.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749431},{"amount":95.52,"local_amount":155.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":158.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613338},{"amount":97.37,"local_amount":158.98,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":161.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857058},{"amount":766.07,"local_amount":1250.72,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133715}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T19:24:03Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:06:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":539288,"name":"Selnys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selnys lives in Felix, a small village about few kilometers from Port-Salut in an area without access to electricity.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEka requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Eka will build a shed for chicks. After the shed is built she will be able to purchase chicks, raise them to sell, and increase the income of the family.

She is married and lives with her husband and 33-year-old daughter, in Kaspi district. Makvala requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the monthly income of her husband and daughter. Her husband works as a laborer in a cement factory, and her daughter is a nurse at the local hospital. Their income is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMakvala requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions, to the country's rural poor people, who do not have access to regular credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Makvala will trade in clothing. She plans to purchase clothing at wholesale prices and then resell the garments at higher prices, among her fellow villagers. This will increase the income of the family.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

It has nine members and an executive board, with Hilda as president. The members of the group are engaged in various activities, among them quinoa sales, grocery shop, trousers sales, cattle sales, an artesan's workshop, and a sewing workshop. This loan will thus benefit a group of very small entrepreneurs with diverse businesses. Hilda tells us that she has been working with Pro Mujer for five cycles. She got to know this field partner thanks to a spokesperson, who came to visit her at her house. Hilda has a sewing workshop, a trade she learned from her husband three years ago.

In particular, they have two pigs and sell piglets seasonally. In addition, they have a vineyard with 600 samples of wine trees. They produce wine for selling locally.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBesik requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of their low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBesik has now requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the credit received, Besik will purchase a minibus. After purchasing a minibus, Besik will be able to work for a private company, which produces metal equipment.

He has a large family: parents, wife, an infant son, brother, daughter-in-law and nephew. Valeri requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where 70 peach trees are grown. In addition, Valeri has a tractor, which is used for tilling services. Valeri serves local people for tilling services and earns money. It is hardly enough to provide food for such a large family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nValeri requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Valeri will open an auto parts shop. He plans to purchase a stock of automotive parts for selling in his shop. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1315198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to open an auto parts shop to help support his large family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Dzirkoki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-18T21:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-17T21:00:09Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valeri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":303},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":610},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":190},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":547},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":610},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":547},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570384},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969017},{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749435},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613342},{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857062},{"amount":303,"local_amount":303,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":303,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133719},{"amount":3347,"local_amount":3347,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3347,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107311}],"funded_date":"2013-04-03T23:34:33Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:39:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C Pettersen"}},{"id":539247,"name":"Filomeno Serapio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Filomeno es un hombre de 54 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad Ica, en el distrito de Parcona con su hijo, a quien ama y es su principal raz\u00f3n en la vida, \u00e9l es una persona muy amable, trabajador y entusiasta, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por sacar adelante a su hijo, ya que Filomeno siempre ha sido padre y madre para \u00e9l;

","en":"Nargiza was born in a mountain village in Kyrgyzstan. She is married and raising one son. Nargiza was born in a simple farmer family. She was the youngest daughter and always helped her mother to care for the house and her father to care for the livestock, as her older sisters and brothers were adults and lived separately with their own families.\r\n\r\nAfter she got married, she and her husband started a business of livestock breeding with 30,000 som (KGS). Currently Nargiza has two dairy cows and nine sheep on her farm, allowing the family to get a monthly income in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and reselling livestock. They also have four bulls and four horses. \r\n\r\nTo increase the number of livestock and the size of the barn, Nargiza turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase sheep and cows. Nargiza plans to further successfully develop her business, which will help her realize her dream of building a house.
