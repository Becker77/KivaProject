He is married and lives with his wife and two children. Rezo requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business startup but without success. The only source of the income for the family has been from the clothing Rezo buys and resells to villagers. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n<p>\r\nThe reason Rezo was rejected for a loan was because of the family\u2019s low income and poor living conditions. In most cases the rural poor do not have access to loans because they are regarded as high-risk borrowers.

Esther works in agriculture, which is an activity that she is pleased to do. \r\n\r\n\u201cIn the fields, I feel free. Also, everything that I have is thanks to the sweat from my own forehead,\u201d she says. \r\n\r\nOn her land, she grows peas, beans, corn, and potatoes, which she sells in the wholesale market 20 minutes from her neighborhood. She receives support in her work from her older children and her husband. \r\n\r\nFor every planting, she has to make a big investment. For example, a sack of organic fertilizer costs between 120 and 140 soles, and she needs 5 to 10 sacks.

taking good care of his family, Nowa started up a hardware business as a major source of income.The business is located at Karuguza, on the outskirts of Kagadi town, and his customers are residents of the area.\r\n\r\nNowa is always challenged by the means of transport from his home to his business.

In winter his animals stay in the barn and in the warm season the roam the pasture, where they stay until November. Meat and dairy products, which come from his animals, he sells to his townsman's in Vanadzor. He has many customers and the profit from his activity allows him to meet his family\u2019s needs.\r\nSo Stepan is requesting a loan from Kiva to buy four cows.

He will use the proceeds from his business to repay the loan. He still has challenges of limited capital and the fluctuation of agricultural products on the market.

She owns her own home which, through many years of hard work and effort on her part, she has managed to build from solid materials.\r\n\r\nBrigida describes herself as a woman with a great capacity for work and, as such, when she found herself unemployed and needing to provide for her household, she responded to encouragement from her husband and used a little money they had saved up to open a stall in a small local market in her town.\r\n\r\nBrigida says that she chose her business because it is a simple one and because the merchandise is not perishable unlike that which is sold in other businesses.  In addition, it is a business that allows her to make many friends while she sells her products, which she buys wholesale in the city of Lima.  She makes a monthly trip to the city in order to stock her business.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Brigida hopes to save up enough money to open a store in another location in her town so that she can better serve her loyal customers, who are mainly farmers.  On this occasion, Brigida needs to borrow 4,000 soles so that she can buy a consignment of clothes which includes pants (trousers), blouses, polo shirts and school

They live together in good solid house, the result of hard work and dedication. In order to work in a job that would help the family\u2019s finances and improve their prospects, Delia chose to earn her living by selling clothing, a job she\u2019s now had for 35 years. During this time it has become a successful business providing a source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nAll begins with a selection of various clothes which are then transported to nearby areas to sell at good prices.

business owner in the US.  After living in Italy and France for 35 years, Khosrow wanted to provide a better life with more opportunity for his daughter and moved his family to the US in 2002.  It was not an easy move, but the struggle to start a life in a new country empowered Khosrow to start his own business. \n\nHaving lived in the south of France for many years, Khosrow had a deep appreciation for the specialty tablecloths and napkins from the Provence region.  His enthusiasm sparked a business idea\u2014to provide quality tablecloths and impeccable service to Americans. Khosrow\u2019s idea quickly flourished into a successful local shop, Desire. \n\nThe recent recession pushed Khosrow to move his business to farmers\u2019 markets and close his shop in 2007.   Although a major decision, Khosrow found that he still retained much of the business he had established and enjoyed the personal interaction with customers at the markets.  His daily motto is, \u201cIf you are good and honest, people come back to you.\u201d\n\nHowever, in 2008, more disaster struck.  A break-in occurred at Khosrow\u2019s warehouse and over $97,000 in inventory was stolen.  Devastated, Khosrow picked up what was left of his business and started over using all that he had left.  His loyal clientele stood behind him and bit-by-bit Khosrow was able to regain some of his losses.\n\nSince then, Khosrow has continued to work almost every day selling his specialty tablecloths, napkins and other Jacquard fabrics from Provence.  With this Kiva loan, Khosrow will be able to purchase more inventory to be able to open another booth at a secondary market every day, reaching more customers.  Khosrow\u2019s goal is to hire an employee and teach them his daily motto and the benefits of being a smart business owner."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1315760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Although most surfers were men, Lola embraced being a female surfer.  As she began surfing more, she found that the typical surfboard just didn\u2019t meet the needs of a female surfer, and that the regular boards were bulky and difficult to manage.  She began to order custom-shaped boards that worked better for her body.\r\n\r\nLola quickly learned that she was not alone and that many other female surfers wanted a surfboard more proportional to their build.  Girls at the beach kept asking her how to get a board like hers\u2014sometimes literally buying the board out from under her arm.  Lola saw that many girls needed boards made just for them and had the idea for her business, Chick Sticks, a company specifically dedicated to providing surfboards and gear just for girls.  \r\n\r\nLola quit her job as a realtor and put all of her savings towards opening her shop.  Since then, she\u2019s expanded to a second factory location where her team of employees cut, shape, paint and glass the boards in-house.  \r\n\r\nWhat sets Chick Sticks apart is Lola\u2019s energy, creativity and commitment to empowering young girls. Before being painted, each board receives a special message of encouragement from Lola herself.  Lola also sponsors a surfing team of over 20 girls, providing boards and gear to many who would be unable to afford to compete.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, Lola will be able to purchase new stock and inventory so she can work ahead of the influx of orders she receives for custom boards.  Lola will also be able to embark on her new line of athletic wear for girls, which will provide them with surfing wear and gear designed specifically with their needs in mind.  With this new growth, Lola hopes to share her message of empowerment to girls who surf and skate alongside the best of the boys.

In particular they have a plot of agricultural land, where maize and haricot are grown. Manana\u2019s husband cultivates the land and does all the agricultural works to insure a good harvest. In addition they have a milking cow. Manana milks the cow and produces dairy products. It is hardly enough to supply food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nMaia requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of a business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Maia will begin selling cheese. She plans to purchase cheese from the wholesalers and then resell it at higher prices in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia. This will be hard to do for the young woman, but this will increase the income of the family and she will do her best to improve the living conditions of her children. She awaits your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1316063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

He is married and lives with his wife and parents. Several times, Medgar requested loans from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, the family has 0.45 hectares of agricultural land where different kinds of products are grown. In addition, they have three milking cows. Medgar\u2019s wife milks the cows and produces dairy products for sale. The income is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nMedgar requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Medgar will trade in animals. He plans to purchase cows from the wholesalers and then resell them at a higher price. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person.  She dedicates all of her efforts to providing a better life for her family.  \r\n\r\nSadly, she lost her beloved husband.  Since then, she has become the principal pillar of support for her children.  Unfortunately, due to lack of financial resources she had to work from the time she was very young, so she was not able to pursue a degree in nursing. In her free time she likes to cook.  She especially enjoys making the delicacy <em>Carapulcra con Sopa Seca<\/em> (a dish made with chicken, pork and noodles) to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, with much sacrifice and dedication, Dionisia runs her own small business selling fruit, especially fried items such as salted potatoes, salted chicken, hot dogs and hamburgers.  She also has a business renting out a mototaxi to other drivers.  She works every day for approximately 10 hours. She believes that things are going well thanks to the good flavor of her food and the friendly service that she provides to her customers.\r\n\r\nDionisia is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help she will be able to purchase a small stand in the central market of her city.  In this way she will be able to reach a larger number of customers and will be able to attend to them in a more suitable

Zaida normally works from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. She is able to sneak away during slow times to check on her son, who needs a lot of attention. This can make her work difficult, but it is also something that she knows will improve because her boy is growing more each day. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her business is that she is able to do other things while she runs her sweets stand at the same time. She has been working like this for three years, and says that hardest part of this work is standing out in the sun all day long. Zaida hopes that in the future she will be able to open a store to better attend to her customers. \r\n\r\nThis is Zaida's second Kiva loan.

Her previous loan was a big help not just in her business but also in her family. She was able to buy more hogs and feeds thus generating  more income. Piggery is her business for five years now. She and her husband who is a farmer work hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 10,000 PHP loan for her to loan to buy additional hogs and feeds needed for her business. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nSofia hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams of having a good life.

","en":"Fatima, 31, who lives in Cartagena, faces the challenge of attending to her household obligations every day and the responsibility of earning income through selling gold and silver jewelry, an activity she has been doing since five years ago, when a friend awoke her entrepreneurial spirit. Her household is made up of her husband and two small children. She has a stable customer base, to whom she sells on cash and credit. She sells rings, earrings, bracelets, and gold and silver chains. Little by little, her customers have referred new buyers to her, which means that many times she doesn't have enough working capital to meet the demand for these articles. Now she has come to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a Kiva credit. This is her first financing from the organization.

Credo approved his loan request, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to Georgia's rural poor, who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Irakli will buy a truck of his own.

She currently has two sewing machines, which she utilizes to stitch salwar suits (traditional Indian dresses).\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan of 30,000 INR through People\u2019s Forum to purchase thread, fabrics, needles, and another sewing machine (picot sewing machine) that will help her do picot stitching for sarees (a special stitch for saree edges) and stitch saree blouses. \r\n\r\nPuspanjali also plans to buy some cloth and make dresses to sell. She says the gain from her business will help her to strengthen her family financially and help her to be more independent. She hopes to be able to train some girls in her village and hire them for help by buying more sewing machines and growing her business, creating a living for other girls in the village.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1316058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase thread, fabrics, needles, and a sewing machine for her tailoring shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhuban, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2013-03-19T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-18T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-19T22:48:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":539555,"name":"Ketty's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ketty's group is comprised of three hard-working, young women.

He is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person. He and his wife dedicate all of their efforts to providing a better life for their family.\r\n\r\nThanks to his efforts, Edwin was previously studying for a professional degree in accounting.

Diariamente inicia sus servicios desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana llegando a extenderse hasta las 9 de la noche, dependiendo de las necesidades de su clientela, especialmente en las temporadas de picos altos en sus ventas, las cuales hace de contado y a cr\u00e9dito. Su meta es aumentar su capital d e trabajo, para tener siempre una liquidez que le permita exhibir los inventarios que mas rotan y con los que muchas veces no cuenta en su estanter\u00eda. Esta es la raz\u00f3n principal para aplicar a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y con el cual planea comprar \u00fatiles escolares, calzado y perfumer\u00eda. Su inversi\u00f3n se har\u00e1 exitosa porque cuenta con una demanda permanente en el merado educativo y su experiencia la direcciona hacia el logro de su prop\u00f3sito de venta.","en":"Leomaldy is 50 years old, and she lives with her husband.  She has children between the ages of 19 and 28.  She started her entrepreneurial experience one year ago.  She did this in order to improve the household income and to give the household greater well-being.\r\n\r\nShe started a business activity of selling school supplies, stationery goods, costume jewelry, purses, toiletries, and perfume.  She starts her services daily from nine in the morning, and she works up until nine at night, depending on the customers\u2019 needs.  She especially works these hours during high sales seasons, and she sells for cash and on credit.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to increase her working capital in order to always have liquidity.  This will allow her to display the inventory that turns over the most, which she often does not have on her shelf.\r\n\r\nThis is the main reason for applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to use the loan to buy school supplies, shoes, and perfume.  Her investment will be successful because there is a constant demand in the educational market.  Also, her experience guides her towards achieving her sales goal.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1316508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy school supplies, shoes, and perfume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-03-19T22:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-18T22:30:10Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leomaldy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1170000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81062},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87503},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89545},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91635},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":93773},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95961},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98200},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100491},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":102836},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":105235},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":107691},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":116068}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.03,"local_amount":81062,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":81479.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527929},{"amount":48.62,"local_amount":87503,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":87953.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928671},{"amount":49.74,"local_amount":89545,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":90006.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705819},{"amount":50.91,"local_amount":91635,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":92106.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968108},{"amount":52.1,"local_amount":93773,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":94255.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817301},{"amount":53.31,"local_amount":95961,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96455.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323574},{"amount":54.56,"local_amount":98200,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":98705.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082808},{"amount":295.73,"local_amount":532321,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":535061.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062178}],"funded_date":"2013-03-20T00:59:19Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:29:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":539586,"name":"Antonio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonio is a 49-year-old fisherman from Ubay, Bohol.

All the women work together in the program. In addition to their individual activities, they also work together. They mutually help each other to reach their goals, which are working to support their families. One story is that of Lorena, who works selling oil, flour, sugar, and meat to make empanadas and milanesa (breaded cutlets), picadillo (a dish with ground beef and tomatoes), detergent, and vegetables, which she herself brings from another country.

He lives with his parents, aunt, and grandmother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Avtandil\u2019s mother is a teacher at a local school and earns a monthly income. Avtandil requested a loan from local financial institutions several times, for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nAside from his grandmother's pension and his mother's teaching salary, the only source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides, they have a plot of agricultural land, where 250 nut trees are grown. Avtandil sells the harvested nuts and the cheese locally, at good prices. But the family's income is hardly enough to provide food for the five-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRecently, Avtandil requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Credo approved his loan request, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit, with soft conditions, to the country's rural poor people, who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Avtandil will trade in pottery. He plans to purchase pottery from the wholesalers and then resell it at higher prices. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1316177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy pottery from wholesalers, which he will resell at higher prices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Shroma","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-20T01:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-19T01:00:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avtandil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":101.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":107.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.17,"local_amount":91.47,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":94.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570398},{"amount":59.99,"local_amount":95.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":99.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969031},{"amount":61.52,"local_amount":98.43,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":102.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749449},{"amount":63.6,"local_amount":101.76,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":105.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613356},{"amount":65.36,"local_amount":104.58,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":108.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857074},{"amount":67.36,"local_amount":107.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":111.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133731}],"funded_date":"2013-03-20T03:49:39Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:06:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":539602,"name":"William","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"William, 51, is married with seven children.

To support the daily basics in the family, she runs a small grocery stall at home as her main source of income and supplements her income through rice farming and pig-raising. She has been with this business for several years. \n\nWith VisionFund, Loeurb is a third-time borrower who has fully repaid her previous loans. The previous loans helped her earn a decent income and improve her living conditions. Now, she is in a group of three to apply for a new loan. She and one of her co-borrowers are seeking 1,400,000 KHR, whereas the third group member is applying for 1,000,000 KHR. As the group leader, Loeurb will use her loan portion to pay for the reaping fee and to buy pig feed. She hopes to collect her crop yield and sell at a good price so she can improve her standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1298239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To pay for the reaping fee and to buy pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ek Phnom district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-03-20T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-19T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leourb","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Theourn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":513.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":461.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.63,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":408867.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942757},{"amount":436.18,"local_amount":1700000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1737688.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410225894},{"amount":436.19,"local_amount":1700000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T10:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1737688.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450134802}],"funded_date":"2013-03-20T03:58:09Z","paid_date":"2014-02-19T10:17:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}}]}
