Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

This is 47-yea-old Anna M. from Mbeya. She is widowed with 3 children between the ages of 13 and 24. Anna has been running a local restaurant known as \u201cmamalishe\u201d since 1989. \r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantain (a savory cooked banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.\r\n\r\nShe works at her business for 9 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Anna currently earns about $120 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 USD to purchase foods like rice beans, potatoes,cooking oil and other items for her business. In the future, she plans to increase number and varieties of services in her restaurant . Anna thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase food and other items for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-14T00:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna E.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At the weekends Hugo works in his fields, while from Monday to Friday he drives a heavy-duty truck for a mining company.\r\n\r\nThanks to his wife\u2019s hard work, his fields produce a good crop of beans, corn, potatoes and peas. For the last twenty years she has tended these crops and at the same time has never neglected her household duties. \r\n\r\nHugo\u2019s greatest pleasure is picking the ripe beans which he then parboils with salt and enjoys them as if they were a true delicacy. His work as a farmer is profitable and he can cover the household costs with the money he earns. \r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to buy more land and increase production.

It is also known for its wood, ceramic, and reed handicrafts.

He has 13 cows, and 6 of them produce milk daily.  His stable is a half hour from his house.  He goes there very early everyday to milk the cows.  He sells the milk to a wholesaler in the area. \r\n\r\nAs this activity is his only source of income, Pablo always feeds his livestock well and takes good care of them.  He now wants to get balanced nutritional feed and natural grass to improve the milk production of his cows.  That is why he has requested a loan for 1,000 PEN from Edypme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nPablo is a family man who really likes the work he does.  He has always counted on it to get ahead.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: hog raising, running a general store, and managing a sugarcane plantation. Her husband Francisco, who is 52 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps with his wife\u2019s business activities. They have four children who are between 24 to 32 years old. All of them have family of their own.  \r\n\r\nJosephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josephine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 21,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP and uplifted the family\u2019s standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP to buy feed and fertilizer to continue to save for the future expansion of her hog raising business. Josephine is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":269766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase the capital by purchasing more crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-14T00:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Upendo I.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

If she is not contented with her daily sales turnover in the market, she goes to other municipalities on their scheduled market day to sell.<p>\r\n\r\nWithout much training, Sherly has able to develop an entrepreneurial skill and attitude within herself through practical experience, just like other poor women. She is determined to change their standard of living so that her 17-year-old only child can graduate from college. She will never surrender to the challenges poverty will bring her. Through loans she can access from ASHI and KIVA, she will be have an opportunity to grow and expand her hog fattening business until she has a

She lives together with her husband, who works as a trader for various products, which he markets door to door. She also lives together with her two small children, 3 and 2 years of age. Marlene sells many products such as batteries, combs, hair clips and other things. She and her husband are actually passing through a difficult moment as they don't have some basic home services such as water and light, owing to the fact that they don't have the necessary capital to buy them. It is for this reason that Marlene is seeking a loan, with which she can expand her inventory with products such as lamps, calculators, radios and more. These will help them during the Christmas period as their sales can be very good and they can augment their earnings, which she greatly desires and hopes to be able to improve her family situation.

She lives at her sister\u2019s house, which is located in the District of M\u00f3rrope.  The inhabitants of this district mostly live in rural areas and can be found in the Province of Lambayeque, which is 30 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n<p>\r\nLindaura needed for her children to get ahead, so she started a business a year ago of raising and selling guinea pigs.  She keeps them in cages that she stores at the back of her home and sells them to dealers who frequent the area.  Prior to this business, she worked as a farm laborer but the need to obtain a stable source of income made her gradually devote more to time to raising guinea pigs.  Within a year, her business has grown considerably and she has plans to invest the earnings into building new cages.  \r\n<p>\r\nLindaura wants to buy more feed to improve the quality of her animals.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from Edpymne Alternativa in the amount of 1500 PEN in order to meet this objective.  Lindaura is a responsible and determined woman.

Ruth has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Ruth joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ruth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Ruth is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional goats to raise. This will be the third loan taken out by Ruth from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She plans to open a chicken shop with her sister; she\u2019s been planning this for quite some time.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about the communal bank is the unity among the members and the ease of the loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":778483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cologne, jewelry and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ambrosia Nicolasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:27:48Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216543914},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":188.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221712433},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227082808},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":188.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232844435}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T23:17:08Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:41:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":306560,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is married with seven children, four of whom are in school.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. \n\nThe amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Mamlakatjon is 51 years old and lives in the town of Isfara. She is married and has an adult son. Mamlakatjon is processing and selling dried apricots at the central local market.

Because she buys apricots wholesale, her prices are lower than regular market prices. \r\n\r\nShe offers a wide assortment of dried apricots for clients. All this allows Mamlakatjon to make her business quite successful and it brings a consistently stable income for her family.

She lives with her husband and children in the home they own, where they have a small convenience store. For the past 6 years she has sold different products to meet the demand in her neighborhood, which is heavy since her store is the closest one in the area. Liz usually works alone, but when she has to go our to buy more goods her children help out. She likes her work because she can do it from home and she is comfortable selling there. Unfortunately sometimes it is tiring as she has to open at 6 in the morning and stay open until 9 or 10 at night, which makes for a long day. However, thanks to her neighbors who always visit the store, she can chat with them while she works. Liz hopes to expand her business and to keep buying more goods. She has had 16 loans with Microfinanzas PRISMA and each loan has helped to to get ahead bit by bit. Also, working with her communal bank has been good and she is pleased to be part of the group.

After successfully selling some of their property, they bought a cow and a calf. They took a risk to put in $625, which was quite a large sum of money at that time. Now, they have turned it into a monthly income of $100. By means of saving money, they have obtained some necessary equipment for her husband\u2019s work and a car.\r\n\r\nZamira and her husband need a loan to buy another cow. This would enable them breed their cattle and increase its population. \r\n\r\n\"Everything we do, we do for the sake of our children. Our son is growing up. Very soon, he will be going to school. So we need to purchase everything needed for his education, including stationary and (a) school uniform,\" says Zamira.\r\n\r\nTaalaibek, Suyorbubu and Kayir are in the same group with Zamira. Taalaibek is 40. He is married and has three children. Taalaibek provides for his family by collecting milk from local villagers and producing milk products. He sells these products in the city of Alma Ata. He needs a loan to purchase sheep and cows and to increase turnover. \r\n\r\nKayir is 44. She sells yogurt that she produces from her cow\u2019s milk, or from milk that she buys from other villagers. She urgently needs a new fridge to put the milk products in since the old one cannot contain all of her products. She cannot buy a fridge unless she obtains a loan. \r\n\r\nSuyorbubu is a housewife. She keeps a cow and sells milk. Some years ago she obtained a loan and bought a car. Since then, by selling milk she has managed to save enough money to buy new furniture for her son. She wants to obtain a loan to purchase calves and feed for them. After fattening them up, she is going to resell them. \r\n\r\n\"Even though raising livestock requires certain amount of efforts, it is not that troublesome. In a rural area like ours, it is the most convenient business,\" says Suyorbubu with enthusiasm.  \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the three Ps concept: people (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the planet (taking care of the environment).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON International's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She moved to the province of  Manab\u00ed and at present is a member of the communal bank Los Corrales, located in a community on the outskirts of the city of Montecristi.\r\n\r\nOur member is 43 years old, is married and has four children who are all adults. She is an informal vendor of clothes and shoes for women and men. With the loans she has recieved from the Foundation, she has been able to grow her business. She informed us that with her daughter, Magdalena goes out to travel the sector where they live, while her husband has another activity related to selling dairy products. With their life savings, they have been able to buy three cows and they are producing. They make the cheese and the other milk products and later deliver them to stores and other clients.  \r\n\r\nMagdalena will invest her loan in diversifying her business. She will travel to Guayaquil where the big clothing stores are. She makes the trip periodically or at least when there are a lot of orders. She is very grateful to her friend who motivated her to get into sales. Magdalena is very happy with the business because she has been able to help her husband at home with her earnings. With this new loan she will invest in pants, blouses and shoes. She sells by going to visit her customers' houses. She sells on credit and collects every two weeks. Once she recovers the capital, she re-invests in merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":544031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy pants, shoes, blouses and t-shirts.

He is married and has one son. He has a taxi and works as a taxi driver with a low income, and it is the only source of income for the family. Jamal wants to improve the taxi conditions by purchasing a new engine so the taxi's work capacity will increase. The amount of money he has isn't enough to pay for a new engine, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Jamal gets the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, he will purchase a new engine for his taxi. This will increase the capacity for the taxi to work and enable Jamal to work extra hours to increase his income and provide better living conditions to his family. Jamal is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product: FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

He is married and the father of two kids. Currently one is in school whilst the last born is still breastfeeding. Samuel is supportive of his spouse and family through the business he does. He is a car welder in the village where he lives. He sees it as an opportunity to be at home. Samuel went through his apprenticeship 10 years ago in the town of Kumasi in the Ashanti region of Ghana. With that period of experience, hard work, humility and time abound. <P>\r\n\r\nHe decided to move to his home town to establish his welding shop. Through that period it was very difficult for him to start something on his own because he did not have enough money. He went into farming for a while to gather a small amount of money as start-up capital. What the money could do at that time was to buy wood to erect a shop. <P>\r\n\r\nUpon advice from friends who are members of Sinapi Aba Trust, he decided to ask for a loan to make business progress. Though at that period he had started working on customers' cars, coal pots, ovens, etc., he was still faced with financial challenges. Samuel is requesting a loan to buy welding machines, steel plates, and silver plates, among others.

In addition, Sully works as a handicraft instructor at several institutions; with 8 years of experience in her business she is already an expert, and things are continuing to go well.  Right now her goal is to have separate premises constructed where she can set up a crafts workshop that has everything she needs.  This is Sully\u2019s second loan with Kiva partner MFP.

By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8000. \r\n\r\nGemma is borrowing PHP 28000 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Gemma aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is married and has one child, aged 9.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, she established  her vegetable farming business. Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW. She used her most recent loan to buy seeds and fertilizers.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Durga plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  \r\n\r\nWith a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer. With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Having successfully repaid the previous loan, they are now on their second agricultural loan.\r\n\r\nHawa, who is sitting and wearing a white top and a red headscarf, will use her portion of the loan to buy a sufficient quantity of peanuts for planting, as well as small farming equipment and agricultural inputs at the general market in San.\r\n\r\nAfter the rainy season, crops are stored for a while so that they can gain value before being resold at the general market in Kimparana and in surrounding markets, retail (often in bulk), in cash to customers usually from large cities.\r\n\r\nAfter selling their agricultural products each member of the Djekafoton 2 group hopes to achieve profits between 16,000 and 67,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay loan interests and cover ongoing family expenses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":790748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs, seeds and small farming equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Dakoura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Konimba N\u00b0 1 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Sidi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":335000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":335000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":335000,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-18T08:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":342889.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424528}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T08:41:19Z","paid_date":"2012-04-18T08:22:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":310689,"name":"Furaha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Furaha is a married woman with two children.

On display at the happily married mother of four's Pub are a variety of both hard and soft alcoholic beverages. She has been riding high on some early flood of success on the basis of the fact that she has been able to meet the demands of her clients since she took root. From her recollection, she says she does not call to mind a single day when she ran short on drinks. The fact that she is eking out subsidiary income from her other business, for example food sales, has been pivotal. She reckons that she will use her profits to restock her Pub. Week in, week out, her gross sales returns are to the tune of Uganda shillings 100,000. She reckons she will be able to generate more income once she utilizes this Kiva loan efficiently.\r\n\r\nThus far, Rosette has weathered the early storms that have plagued her enterprise, albeit at a cost.

She owns a small stationers in the center of Juliaca city, selling notebooks, pens, markers, and all kinds of stationary. Currently, she is taking advantage of the fact that the beginning of the school year is approaching for most of the city's schools, and selling all the best kinds of school supplies.

They average 38 years of age and 5 children, and live in polygamous families. They got acquainted through bonds of kinship and neighborhood. These women benefited from several business loans from Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso, and all loans were repaid without problems. They are now seeking their third farming loan, a category matching their businesses, and the previous two loans were repaid without problems.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to pay for the cost of tillage, hoeing, and to buy seeds, fertilizers and herbicides. They cultivate an area of 6 hectares, and grow peanuts and rice. These women hope to achieve an average yield of 3 tons per hectare, for a total of 18 tons. Part of the harvest will be eaten, and the remainder will be firstly stored, and then resold for cash at the fairs in Fakola and in the surrounding villages, mostly to resellers coming from the larger cities.

Vasya\u2019s merchandise is unique in the marketplace where he works, which draws many customers to his vending kiosk. Low competition and lending assistance have helped Vasya\u2019s business develop and keep a stable standing. In the last four years his enterprise grew to 40,000 Grivnyas in inventory, 15,000 Grivnyas in gross income and 6,000 Grivnyas in net profit each month.  \r\n\r\nVasya is requesting a loan of 10,000 Grivnyas to increase his working capital and sales as a result. One of the most outstanding characteristics of his venture is its stability and consistent growth. We believe this current loan will help Vasya keep his business running and extend it even further.

The extra capital will enable her to expand her merchandise and thus improve her business and increase her profits.\r\n\r\nMuharram\u2019s dreams are to have her own large store one day but most importantly, to enable her children to have a better future, once they start to study at school, then university, become professionals, and lead healthy and comfortable lives. On behalf of Muharram and everyone here at IMON International, thank you for your support!\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by MUK. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Panca Kerti 2 (MUK-0009).\n\nNi Wayan is married and has three adult children. She owns and operates a business selling religious items, primarily selling flowers and other votive offerings to tourists and local community members. She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 500,000 IDR a month.\n\nIn 2007, Ni Wayan joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK. She is now requesting a new loan of 3,000,000 IDR which will be used to purchase materials to make prayer\/worship materials. The loan will be her 1st from MUK.\n\nNi Wayan plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\n\n About MUK:\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\n\n\nNote to Kiva Lenders:  \nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\n\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\n \nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click here.\n\n\n***************************************************** \nNI WAYAN W.

Dalam 2007, NI WAYAN bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.

Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 3,000,000 IDR.\n\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 2nd pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\n\nTentang MUK:\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\n\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\n\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":503820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious Articles","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials to make prayer\/worship materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T23:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":9000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":9000000,"processed_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9195000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319852}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T13:28:12Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":187776,"name":"Shavkatdjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0414\u0436\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u0428\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043d\u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 37 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435- \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \"\u0411\u0443\u0445\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0440\". \u041f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 3 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430.","en":"Shavkatdjon D. lives in the city of Tursun-zoda.

Malipayon, Brgy. Binicuil, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store.  \r\n\r\nAdelfa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she wanted a better life for her family. With the help of sixteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adelfa has been achieving her goal of lifting her family out of poverty, and doing it by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 25,000, which meant major improvements in her family's lifestyle.  \r\n\r\nAdelfa has applied for her 17th loan, for PHP 22,500, which she intends to use to buy more items to sell to her customers. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a native of Maputo and a daughter of a police officer and a homemaker. She attended school until the 8th grade. She started working at the age of 27. Although due to sickness, she had to abandon her job. Later, her godfather offered her a kiosk, which she left to construct a small commercial establishment near the Ferroviario club in 1986. In 2003, the municipal council destroyed the building. That same year she rented a stand at the People's Market. <p> Through a cousin, Alice came to know Hluvuku-Adsema and asked for a loan of 1,000 dollars to invest in her business. With a previous loan, she was able to improve the conditions of her business, increasing qualitatively and quantitavely the meals she prepares. She has 2 establishments, the second localized in the Maxaquene district. This establishment allows her to work later hours. The establishment located in the People's Market must close by 7pm, the time when she has the most customers. The community is greatly impacted by this business; beyond providing food to local workers, her income allows her to support 5 people and employ two kitchen workers. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAlice \u00c2ngelo Covela, nascida em 26 de Fevereiro de 1959, natural de Maputo, filha de Pai Policia e m\u00e3e domestica, estudou ate oitava classe. Come\u00e7ou a trabalhar aos 27 anos, onde por motivo de doen\u00e7a teve que abandonar o emprego. Mais tarde o seu padrinho ofereceu lhe um quiosque onde come\u00e7ou a praticar a actividade que at\u00e9 agora desenvolve, alienou esse estabelecimento e foi construir um pequeno estabelecimento comercial no recinto do clube Ferrovi\u00e1rio em 1986 onde veio a sair em 2003 com a destrui\u00e7\u00e3o das mesmas pelo conselho Municipal. No mesmo ano ela foi alugar uma banca No Mercado do Povo onde at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o desenvolve a sua actividade.\r\n<p>\r\nPor interm\u00e9dio de uma prima sua e que \u00e9 cliente da Hluvuku-Adsema informou se sobre os requisitos e recorrendo a um empr\u00e9stimo de 15 000,00mt para refor\u00e7ar deste modo o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nCom o empr\u00e9stimo de 25.000,00mt melhorou cada vez mais as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de atra\u00e7ao de clientes no seu estabelecimento tendo aumentado qualitativamente e quantitativamente as refei\u00e7\u00f5es que confeciona.\r\n\r\nConta actulamente com 2 estabelecimentos e que o segundo est\u00e1 localizado no bairro de Maxaquene. Este, permite-lhe trabalhar at\u00e9 mais  tarde j\u00e1 que no Mercado do Povo onde est\u00e1 localizado o 1\u00ba estabelecimento, n\u00e3o \u00e9 permitido trabalhar acima das 19 horas e sendo este, o  momento em que regista maior afluxo de clientes.\r\n\r\nA actividade tem um impacto positivo na comunidade pois para al\u00e9m de fornecer refei\u00e7\u00f5es aos funcion\u00e1rios que trabalham a redor do mercado, com os rendimentos consegue sustentar 5 pessoas que est\u00e3o na sua responsabilidade e dar emprego a duas serventes de cozinha com quem
