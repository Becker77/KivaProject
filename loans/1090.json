He joined his brother's business, who supplied him with patent medicines to be sold and paid back at a particular cost.  He did it for some years and the commission he got was used to start his own business. Working 7 days a week and 15 hours a day, he earns about 1,836,000 SLL every month from this business.\n\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Alimamy requires a loan in order to buy chargers, mobile phones, memory cards, phone screens, phone speakers and phone batteries. In the future, Alimamy plans to educate his children, open a shop and build a house.  This loan will help to buy more stock and maximize profits.  Sometimes he can buy phones that may be faulty.

However, they work hard every day so that their children can enjoy a better future and become good, upstanding citizens.\r\n\r\nThe coordinator of the Luz Divina community bank is Nubia, whose business is making and selling cuajada (a type of cheese).  She makes her sales from home and also as an itinerant street vendor.  Nubia works for 8 hours a day, selling her products which she carries in a 15kg (33lb) basket on her head.  She is requesting this loan to invest in working capital and buy raw materials for making and selling cuajada such as milk, rennet and plastic bags so that, in the not-so-distant future, she can make better income.  The 'Luz Divina' community bank is grateful for the help that Kiva lenders provide to people with limited resources in poor countries such as Nicaragua so that they can earn a decent living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1315826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to invest in working capital and buy raw materials for making and selling cuajada such as milk, rennet and plastic bags","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-03-20T10:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-19T10:50:01Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nubia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Danelia Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Haydde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.55,"local_amount":3274.15,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356527156},{"amount":257.84,"local_amount":6321.19,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-22T09:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6413.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364568397},{"amount":260.23,"local_amount":6379.71,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6473.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373163011},{"amount":260.2,"local_amount":6379,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6472.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381968783},{"amount":255.98,"local_amount":6275.54,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6367.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390830587},{"amount":259.59,"local_amount":6364.24,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6457.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399855384},{"amount":122.61,"local_amount":3006.17,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3050.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410130694}],"funded_date":"2013-03-20T12:59:49Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T15:49:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":539887,"name":"Marco Aurelio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marco Aurelio de 39 a\u00f1os de edad es un campesino de la Vereda Betania del municipio del Carmen de Viboral, Colombia.

Both businesses support her household which is made up of her husband and her two children (5 and 11).  Luzmila arrived in the city of Barranquilla from her home town of Ceret\u00e9, in C\u00f3rdoba department, 12 years ago.  It was at this point that she started gaining experience in selling fruit and vegetables, alongside her husband.  Three years ago, she started selling tomatoes, onions, garlic and scallions, and fruit such as apples, oranges, mangos, papaya, melons, watermelons, lemons and every delicious, juicy fruit that grows on Colombian soil.   Her main purchasers are the stores and restaurants near her business and also in other communities where she has gradually gained new customers.  Luzmila and her husband work from Monday to Saturday, from 6.00am to 4.00pm.  Her current goal is to expand her stock but she doesn't have enough capital to do so.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy greater quantities of tomatoes, onions and seasonal fruit.  She will also respond to customer orders for beauty products which is how she complements her income.  She has a good customer base for these products.  Luzmila's goal is to improve her well-being by working.  She hopes to provide her children with a good-quality education so that they can get ahead in life and be

The place where they meet is quite peaceful and they have all known each other very well for many years.  The group got its name because the area is characterized by its apple orchards.\r\n\r\nMarcelina, the group's representative, says that she's forty-six and has been married for twenty-two years to Armando, who works as a bricklayer.  They have three children, who are in various grades in school.  Marcelina earns her living raising and fattening up young sheep for later sale.  She buys the sheep as lambs and then raises and fattens them up for a few months.  Once they're big and fat she says she sells them to her neighbors, bbq pitmasters, or just to people who come to her house asking if she sells sheep.  In most of those cases, they probably want to buy a sheep to barbeque for a party or some other kind of celebration.\r\n\r\nThis time Marce is seeking a loan from the organization to buy more lambs; she's not exactly sure how many because she doesn't know what kind of prices she'll encounter.  She doesn't need to buy food because in her area they can pasture the sheep every afternoon.  She has been raising sheep for two years and says, \"I needed a way to help my husband with household expenses and the children's education, and raising sheep at my house has really benefited me because I could raise the sheep while looking after my children.\"  The only difficulty is when the sheep get sick and die, which means a loss of profits and investment.\r\n\r\nMarce says that when she started raising sheep she didn't know how to care for them and was very careless. One day she fed them tamales and corn, which are really fattening and hurt and killed the sheep.  She never neglected her sheep like that again.  Marce's goals motivate her to keep raising her sheep.  One of her objectives is to improve her home because it doesn't have a good kitchen.  She'd also like to have a place where she could sell other things and have another source of income.  \r\n\r\nThe members of the group include Francisco, who will invest his loan in clothing; Elena, who will buy candy and groceries; and Maria, who will buy candy.  They are all very grateful to the institution and Kiva for the loan.  The trust they've shown in lending the group money will be a big help.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1303145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more lambs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Monte Alto, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-03-20T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-19T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":456.22,"local_amount":5848.94,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5860.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596106},{"amount":722.61,"local_amount":9264.23,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9281.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663534},{"amount":508.59,"local_amount":6520.38,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6532.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048948},{"amount":262.58,"local_amount":3366.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3372.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840113}],"funded_date":"2013-03-20T20:41:33Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":537296,"name":"Ann's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ann, 47, lives with her husband and six children in a rural village in the Tbaung Khmum district, Cambodia.

They have little or no collateral and are therefore unable to access loans through traditional banking services. Women make up over 80% of Jiweze\u2019s membership, the majority of whom members live in rural areas and cook over inefficient open fires. These traditional cooking methods produce health-damaging smoke and contribute to the deforestation that is destroying Kenya\u2019s environment. Paradigm\u2019s cookstoves will reduce the toxic smoke a woman inhales by 70% and will reduce the fuel needed to cook by up to 50%, saving families both time and money.\n\nJiweze was started in 2009 and currently stands at a membership of 10,000. Its head office is located in the town of Nakuru, and it has three branch offices spread across Rift Valley Province, Central Province and is currently in the process of spreading towards the Western part of the Kenya. Jiweze employs 30 full-time staff, most of whom are female. In five years\u2019 time, Jiweze hopes to have become a limited company, to become more sustainable and rely less on grant funding,reach 100,000 members, and to cover a larger geographic area. \n\nJiweze has a wide variety of long and short term loan products to fit their clients\u2019 diverse needs. It offers large group loans, small group loans, and individual loans. The majority of loans disbursed are business loans, but Jiweze also offers educational, personal and emergency loans. It charges interest rates of 1.5% to 2.5% on reducing balance per month, depending on the loan size and product. It even offers some loans, specifically those targeting female entrepreneurs, at a very low interest rate of 0.67%. Jiweze has a repayment rate of approximately 95%.\n\nIts members are eager to purchase cookstoves, but Jiweze struggles to raise enough low-interest capital to finance the cookstoves for its members. Up to now, Jiweze has been offering cookstoves to its members on a repayment schedule of 3 monthly payments. With a loan from Kiva, Jiweze will be able to offer cookstoves to its members for smaller payments spread over 5 months instead of 3 months.\n\nWith a KIVA loan of $3,100, Jiweze will buy 200 fuel-efficient cookstoves from Paradigm and will offer its members improved financing terms to purchase a stove. This will make the stoves accessible to even the lowest income members. These stoves will help improve the health and financial stability of a rural families in Kenya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1313637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cookstove products for sale to end users","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nakuru","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.283333 36.066667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":286,"posted_date":"2013-03-20T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-19T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jiweze Women Development Programme","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":620},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":620},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":620},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":620},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":620}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":620},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":620},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":620},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":620},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":620}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1541.67,"local_amount":1541.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1541.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381807986},{"amount":638.98,"local_amount":638.98,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":638.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390668056},{"amount":311.55,"local_amount":311.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-26T08:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":311.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399913861},{"amount":311.6,"local_amount":311.6,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":311.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410196477},{"amount":296.2,"local_amount":296.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":296.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419959932}],"funded_date":"2013-03-20T23:30:07Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:21:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":539070,"name":"Small Scale Growers Sacco Ltd","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Small Scale Growers SACCO (Savings and Credit Co-operative) is an organization dedicated to improving the lives of the poorest members of society.\n\nThe SACCO targets people living on less than $1 a day, who have no collateral and are therefore unable to access loans through traditional banking services.

","en":"Orbelina is a hardworking and enterprising 30-year-old woman. She is married and has four children from her marriage, three of whom study in primary school and one is in secondary school. When the children finish school, they help their parents with the different activities for their crops such as weeding, sowing and spraying fertilizers. \r\n\r\nOrbelina has a complete primary education which she was able to finish thanks to her parents' help who worked hard to give her a primary education so that she could learn the basics as they had little financial resources and couldn't continue helping her. It was her parents who showed her at a young age how to sow and cultivate coffee, which she continues to this day as it is another means of earning an income for her family to cover needs such as the basic grocery basket, clothing, medicine and so on. Orbelina also makes her living in sales, setting up a small grocery store which she saw as necessary given that the demand in the field is low in the area in which she lives. Thanks to the effort put in by her husband and herself, they were able to purchase a plot of land at 1.5 km for their home which they get to on foot. Her coffee product is bought by neighbors, middlemen who come to the area where she lives to purchase it.\r\n\r\nOrbelina is currently seeking help to buy fertilizers, manure and irrigation pumps for her coffee plantations as it is through this mean that she will be able to better care for her product and keep it free from infestations and illnesses such as rust which damages this crop.\r\nOrbelina's dream is that her crops are the most productive and best sold as it is in this way that she will generate an income for her family and give her children a better education so that they can study honorable degrees at university level and so that they take over the property and use their knowledge to make it

This city is the third most populated in the region and it also contributes to activities such as agriculture, cattle rearing, fishery and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nFor the last four years, Rosa has been making her living in agriculture. She learnt this honorable trade from her parents who were also farmers. She spends a lot of her time in the mornings and the afternoons alternating between the household chores. She is always caring for her crops, watering, cleaning, harvesting and sowing in order to offer the goods to her customers at good prices.\r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacle that Rosa has faced is the difficulty in authenticating the land in which she works. However, she has continued to work hard to support the household and support her children's education. Rosa has been a customer of the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for four years and she has had a lot of openings with the 3 loans she has taken out.

During the first months of his own business operation, Sergio kept his full-time job. Now he is exclusively focused on developing SCI.\n\nSCI provides concrete construction including foundations, slabs, floors, sidewalks, curbs, equipment pads, patios, retaining walls and others. SCI business has been more focused on residential projects, but now Sergio is looking to move his business to the next level and started bidding on commercial contracts.\n\nSCI is requesting $10,000 to increase its working capital. It is a common practice in the commercial construction industry that subcontractors get paid in 30-45 days after completing the job, with no cash advances provided, but Sergio has weekly payroll.

She has been doing this for six years in response to the economic difficulties from which her family was suffering.\r\n\r\nShe currently needs a loan to buy some tools and supplies such as condiments, ingredients and utensils. This will enable her to provide better service to her customers.  This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.  In this institution she has found a great deal of support, trust and flexibility.  She hopes to raise her family's standard of living and over time to expand her business and enhance its image."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1316790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and tools to improve her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-21T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-20T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanny Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1584.6,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":122.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":123.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":127.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":128.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":131.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":134.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":136.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":139.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":142.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":144.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":148.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.81},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.3,"local_amount":105.28,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":106.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524933},{"amount":123.6,"local_amount":122.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":123.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133237},{"amount":134.43,"local_amount":133.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":134.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313776},{"amount":143.32,"local_amount":141.94,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":143.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565381},{"amount":145.91,"local_amount":144.51,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":145.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814420},{"amount":149.11,"local_amount":147.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":149.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320593},{"amount":112.92,"local_amount":111.83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":112.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856283},{"amount":684.41,"local_amount":677.82,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":684.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059859}],"funded_date":"2013-03-21T04:20:58Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Bohnert","image":851467}},{"id":538763,"name":"Nem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 33-year-old mother of three children, one of whom remains in school, Nem is a local rice grower and watermelon planter on two hectares of land.

She has a small sewing shop, and she has gained experience in the field for the past 40 years.  Her mother, who was a dress-maker, had her work with fabric, thread and machines daily from a young age.  He interest in the art of sewing brought her to work as an employee in a seamstress shop in the city of Barranquilla in the area of Puerto Colombia.  There she perfected the work.  She began her own business 10 years ago, and she started in her own home.  She started with basic machines and tools that she bought, focusing first on masculine lines, especially men's pants, although she knows sewing for all styles. She makes sales for cash or credit.  Luz Mila works everyday from 8am to 6pm in order to meet her customer's needs.

He lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, with his wife, his retired mother and a daughter. Gocha requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGocha and his wife and daughter are all sellers at the big local market and they get small monthly salaries. Gocha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Gocha will purchase men's shoes at wholesale prices to resell them afterward with a price markup.

They all live in the village of N'gara in the region of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of Mali) and became acquainted through neighborhood ties and kinship.\r\n\r\nThey are petty traders of grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, etc. In order to expand their business, the group decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are in their seventh group loan cycle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Djeneba (sitting in second position  from left to right on the photo) is a major rice seller in the village of N'gara and its surroundings. She plans to use her loan to buy four bags of paddy rice (whole-grain) from farmers at the Konodimini fair.\r\n\r\nShe then steams, hulls and strips the rice of its bran before retailing it for cash and credit through home delivery and at the Konodimini fair to both men and women customers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Djeneba hopes to achieve an average monthly profit of 20,000 FCFA with this loan, which will be reinvested in the business and used for the upkeeping of the household children.\r\n\r\nJust like the other women in the group, Mrs Djeneba aims to increase the volume of her business in partnership with Soro Yiriwaso."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1318113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy paddy rice (whole-grain)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Gara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-03-21T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-20T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanata          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arakiatou           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":360000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":61193.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636574},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":61193.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030072},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":61193.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030073},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":61193.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819571},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":61193.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678463},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":61193.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924110}],"funded_date":"2013-03-21T14:41:00Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":539677,"name":"Radim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Radim is a 31-year-old man, married with two children.

For the past two years, Justine has been working hard to manage her bar business, which sells local brew. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Justine has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more millet and sorghum for making the brew, and it will help Justine to generate greater profits and own more local bars around the center. Justine hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nJustine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past six years, Joan has been working hard to manage her bar business, which sells local brew. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Joan has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more millet and sorghum for making the local brew, and will help Joan to generate greater profits and buy basic needs for the family. Joan hopes that in the future, she will be able to build a residential house. \r\n\r\nJoan is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

They are often considered \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the credit Mamuka will purchase a mini-bus to start trading fruits and vegetables. He will buy at wholesale prices from Gori markets, bring the products to his village, and resell them with the prices marked up at the local market.

t\u00edtulo que ella nunca pudo tener debido a que los reducidos recursos econ\u00f3micos de sus  padres solo alcanzaron para que ella termine la primaria. \nMartha reside exactamente en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde un lugar hist\u00f3rico de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar.

She is a single mother of three children that go to a state-run school. Her main motivation is to give them a good education so that they can become professionals and receive a degree, something she could not do herself because her parents lacked the resources to support her studies after primary school.\r\n\r\nMartha lives in Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, a historical site in Santo Domingo, which is the capital city of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province, in Ecuador. This province has grown steadily during the last few years. Its capital city is well-known for its fruits and cuisine. It also has important commercial activities and has become an important hub for commercial exchange between the mountain and coastal areas of the country. It also has numerous touristic sites that together with its warm climate attract local and foreign tourists.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of Santo Domingo\u2019s location between the mountains and the coast, people has started all kinds of businesses in order to make a living and support their families. This is Martha\u2019s case, who, with the intention to cover her home\u2019s expenses, decided to start selling clothes as a street vendor two years ago. She learned this activity from her previous jobs and works at least four hours per day, since she also has to cook for her three children and help them with their homework.\r\n\r\nMartha has to walk her city\u2019s long streets, taking and delivering orders, collecting the money and offering the clothes she has in stock. This is why she decided to improve her working tools and buy a motorcycle with the first loan she receives from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa. With a motorcycle, Martha will be able to shorten her travelling time and reach more customers. This will result in an increase in her income and a better support for her children. Martha wants to thank each and every person that, wherever in the world they might be, decided to join her through Kiva in this quest for growth."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1317495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
