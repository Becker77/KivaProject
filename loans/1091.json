This includes the installation of a conventional toilet with the construction of the Bio-San 1 system.  This consists of the utilization of a 600 Its Biodigestor tank.  This will provide better treatment of the waste water, and it will have an absorption well where the sanitized water will go.  This will contribute greatly to the environment.\r\n\r\nThis setup is required because the place where she lives does not have access to sewer lines. For this reason, her family has been using a latrine. Her family is one of thousands who do not have access to improved sanitation. This project will benefit several municipalities across Nicaragua.  It will allow them to have a better quality of life and to also contribute to the environment. \r\n\r\nWithout the opportunity of this loan, it would be impossible for Margarita to have access to a toilet because they are very expensive.

Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is Lia\u2019s small monthly salary. She works as a baker at the local bakery. \r\n\r\nLia requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lia wants to purchase house goods at wholesale prices from the big market in the capital city, bring them to her village, and sell them to her villagers with the price marked up. Lia already has experience in this trading business, so she hopes it will be profitable. Part of the profit will be used for reinvesting in the same business and part will be used to provide better living conditions for her

He is married with four children and lives in Kisharara, Rukungiri District. He is a very hardworking person who juggles tending to his farm with working as a school teacher to earn his salary.\r\nHe is acquiring an agricultural loan to help him boost and improve his agricultural production. He will buy manure to grow bananas and buy feed for his pigs. He started all these projects way back in a quest to improve and increase his family's income.\r\nPreviously, Sam had a problem because of his low family income.

Sylivia is 18 years old and lives in the town of Pallisa in the region of Uganda. For the past year, Sylivia has been working hard to manage her bar business, which sells local brew. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sylivia has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more millet and sorghum for making the local brew and will help Sylivia to generate greater profits and pay for school fees for herself. Sylivia hopes that in the future, she will be able to start up a fish-selling business. \r\n\r\nSylivia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1316443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable

He is married and has two children. He is someone who dreams for his children to have a comfortable life. He has been operating a small grocery store. He spends all his time working in his business. It is his main source of income. As he described, he still suffers a little bit because of the challenges he faced due to bad situations in Yemen. He would like to expand his business so he applied for a second loan of 400,000 YER from AMB to be able to buy more grocery items etc. This will allow him to improve the way in which he displays the products in his store. He thanks Kiva for financing his first loan and he hopes to be financed for this second loan so he can increase his sales and open a call center in his

She is married and has three children who range in age from five to fourteen and each of them attends school. Ana is in her 2nd loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and her business consists of weaving textiles, either colorful \u201chuipiles\u201d, the rectangular shirts that the indigenous women wear, or \u201ccortes\u201d, which are their skirts. Ana needs to secure a loan to buy two looms so that she can increase production. She has sixteen employees (8 women and 8 men) who are excellent workers, especially at this time of the year. In Guatemala, Easter is a big and very popular holiday and as such, families like to purchase new clothes. Ana is well aware of this increased demand and has increased production. The increased earnings will be well used. In addition, Ana owns a stall at the lively market in Totonicapan, a large community that is near her village, where people sell textiles.\r\n\r\nThe 18 women of the trust bank, \u201cGavitas de Chuisuc\u201d, are amazed, pleased and grateful, that they have received financial support in the form of loans from people that they don\u2019t know.\r\nThese ladies have a desire to overcome obstacles and move forward. With their loans, they can transform their own lives, as well as elevate the standard of living for their families and communities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6150,"image":{"id":1315601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy two looms for her weaving business.

She buys furniture wholesale at different carpentry workshops, transports them to her house where her shop is located and distributes the furniture on credit which she then collects each week or fortnight depending on her clients' circumstances. She has been working in this way for more than 3 years and she has the support and assistance of her husband as they began this business together as an opportunity for a better quality of life. What she likes about her job is that she finds it fun to work with her husband, and she is also able to use her free time to look after her children. Her business is going well because she sells high-quality products and she is now in demand with her clients. This is why she wants to strengthen her business and begin to create her own carpentry workshop where she can make furniture with the help of her husband and others. This is her fifth loan with Kiva, and that is why she is grateful for this financial support which allows her to continue with her work. She is committed to making her repayments punctually.

His wife has a position of teacher at high school and recently has taken her maternity leave. He, together with his colleagues, has been making interior decoration work to local customers since 2009. \r\n\r\nThe family purchases water at a high price due to their house not being connected with the central sewer (water) system and burn lot of coal in order to warm up cold water for shower and consumption. So he is requesting a loan of 6,800,000 MNT to connect his house to the central sewer (water) system. As a result, the family will have access to clean drinking water. More importantly, the family won't need to burn coal in order to warm up cold water thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution and energy efficiency.

La tierra que ella junto a su esposo trabaja fue heredada por sus padres mismos que junto a su esposo da la asistencia, el mantenimiento y esta ubicada a una distancia de su casa de habitaci\u00f3n de 4 kil\u00f3metros a la cual se trasladan a pie diariamente.   \n\nActualmente ella solicita ayuda para la compra de fertilizantes, herbicidas, abono para su cultivo de caf\u00e9 ya que hoy en d\u00eda hay mucha plaga y enfermedades que deterioran los cultivos en su totalidad perdiendo todo de no tratar a tiempo. \n\nSu sue\u00f1o es que sus hijos logren educarse para que tengan una mejor calidad de vida, un mejor futuro y puedan aprovechar las oportunidades que en un futuro se les presenten como tambi\u00e9n seguir aumentando su cultivo para obtener mejores ingresos ya que nuestra familia solo depende de este rubro para salir adelante.","en":"Ludim is a young woman. She is 21 years old and married. She is young and strong, and wants to get ahead and have a better life. Her 2 children are both minors and rely entirely on her. One of them is in kindergarten, the other is a newborn. Ludim had to stop going to school after 4th grade as her parents could not afford to continue sending her to school. They showed her how to farm when she was very young; planting and cultivating coffee was her family's only source of income, and allowed them to pay for basic needs - such as food, clothing, medicine. Her parents inherited the land that she works with her husband; the land provides for them. It is located 4 kilometers from her house but she and her husband walk there and back every day. At this time, she is asking for a loan to purchase fertilizer, herbicide and compost to protect the coffee from blight and diseases that spoil the crops; if the coffee is not treated on time, the whole crop is lost. Her dream is that her children will be able to get an education so that they can have a better life and future, and so they can take advantage of opportunities in the future that may arise. She also hopes to keep increasing her output so she can have a better income since her family relies on this work alone to survive and get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1317722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer, herbicide and compost to cultivate coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-03-21T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-20T22:10:06Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ludim Sarai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":7395,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118153}],"funded_date":"2013-03-21T23:44:18Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T10:42:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Helene Hansen","image":null}},{"id":539589,"name":"Chantha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A married woman living in a rural village located in the Kror Kor district of Pursat province, Chantha is 28 years old and has three children; two are in school, while the remaining one is still too young for school.

Marlith makes a living selling soft drinks and food dishes, including gelatin desserts, popsicles and sweets that she makes from tropical fruit. She has ten years experience in this trade, and business is going well. Marlith mostly works on her own, though for some of her catering needs, her mother and children will assist her with washing dishes, prepping food and receiving payments from customers. Marlith has been selling her food dishes and products at a stand on the sidewalk outside her home for the past eight years, and she always works hard to provide high quality food for her customers.\r\n\r\nThe aspects that Marlith likes best about her job are the conversations she gets to have each day with her clients, as those interactions help make long work days seem much shorter. In the future, she hopes to build her own store for selling food dishes and offering improved services to her clients. This is her third Kiva loan, and she is very grateful for the financial support she has received to help make her business and dreams a reality. She promises to continue her history of prompt repayments, and plans to use the support from this loan to purchase soft drinks and ingredients for making her food dishes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1317752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase food ingredients and soft drinks for her catering business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-21T23:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-20T23:10:08Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":191.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":180.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":196.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":204.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":207.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":219.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.64,"local_amount":191.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":196.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869151},{"amount":71.47,"local_amount":180.54,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":185.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578009},{"amount":77.92,"local_amount":196.86,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":202.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530238},{"amount":80.83,"local_amount":204.2,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":210,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975268},{"amount":82.23,"local_amount":207.75,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":213.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996534},{"amount":86.91,"local_amount":219.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":225.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864016}],"funded_date":"2013-03-22T05:22:07Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:23:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":540035,"name":"Monina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monina is 59 years old, married, and has five children.

This group has participated in various loan cycles at the institution. The group's name was chosen by one of the group's members, Adriana, who called it \"Haana\" because that is the name of one of her daughters. Adriana was one of the founding members of the group.  \n\nGroup member Vero is 33 years old and has been married to Victor Manuel for 12 years. Together they have formed a family in which they have two children, one of which is studying. Vero has had a taco restaurant called \"Fernanda\" for the last two years. She says, \"we started the taco restaurant because my father-in-law made a living selling head tacos, and my husband was always helping and that's how he learned to make tacos.\" \n\nVero says that they used to have a grocery store, but they had to close it because they did not earn as much income as before and it was difficult to recoup their losses.  But she also says, \"Every weekend we sold tacos outside of the grocery store and we sold a lot.\"  That was the motivation for starting the taco stand, Vero notes, \"Fortunately, we have a lot of work; in the mornings we serve breakfast, lunch, and the evening we serve dinner.\" The only difficulty is that this time of year is Lent, when red meat isn't eaten and sales drop.  But she knows that the season is temporary and that sales will be better soon.  Vero dreams that one day she will have employees that tend the business because it's a lot of work when all her customers arrive at the same time. \nThe other members of the group have dreams as well, Martin will invest in the sale of clothes, Bertha will invest in her sheep, Adriana will buy cattle, Pablo will invest in dental services, Maria de la Luz will buy bedding, and Maria Alin will invest in clothes and shoes.  They are all very happy and thank the institution for the credit given them, which has been a great help in improving their businesses and families.  \n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5300,"image":{"id":1302553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to equip a taco restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-03-21T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-20T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":5300,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De La Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Alin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":68000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8500},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8500},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8500},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8500},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8500},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":8500},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":8500},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":8500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1275.13,"local_amount":16360.22,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":16379.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596104},{"amount":1374.87,"local_amount":17639.78,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":17660.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663532},{"amount":1987.5,"local_amount":25500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":25529.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048946},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8509.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840111}],"funded_date":"2013-03-22T13:38:39Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Annelise Iversen","image":1190818}},{"id":540034,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer is 20 years old and newly married.

She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, where she also draws strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

has four children. For a period of 20 years, Akylai has worked with livestock breeding, after having started this business with an amount of 4,000 som (KGS).

She began her business many years ago, but she was not able to continue due to many factors, but this helped motivate here idea of having her own business.  One of the problems she had was not having the freedom to venture off on her own.  She has always wanted to work in art and she will use the money from this loan to buy clothing, yarn to make her crafts such as scarves, gloves, hats, and sweaters.  She hopes to have good response to what she buys so that she can begin to solidify her dream.  She has also been able to make good contacts in nearby towns through the communal bank.  This will help her make sales in these areas, or in various artesian fairs.  She stresses that what she has enjoyed about working with Fondo Esperanza is that she has felt very good about the communication with her advisor from the Villarrica office.

Her nuclear family consists of herself, her husband and a daughter.\r\n\r\nAfter being involved in many unsuccessful activities, Djata learned from a neighbor how to buy and sell cashew fruits in order to extract cashew nuts. \r\n\r\nDjata works from home.  Her products are in high demand because of their high quality. She buys her merchandise in bulk quantities and resells to a retail customer base.

Moussa is a mechanic by trade and has been doing this for over eight years. \r\nIn order to assist his customers to obtain quality secondhand spare parts for their vehicles, he also buys and sells spare parts alongside the main business. He is much sought after by his customers, due to the quality of his parts. To meet the needs of his ever growing customer base, he decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution three years ago, and with whom he is now seeking his sixth personal loan. The previous loans have all been fully paid back.\r\nWith this new loan, he intends to purchase a large quantity of spare parts - in particular connecting rods, camshafts, pistons and wheel rims. The items are bought onsite, with him dismantling scrapped vehicles to sell for spare parts in his workshop. Thanks to this loan, he plans to make a monthly profit of 140,000 FCFA which will be used to contribute towards the family's expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the remainder in the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1318281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Pour acheter des pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9tach\u00e9es cass","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Golo - Diassa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-03-22T06:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-21T06:30:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":84404.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030083},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84404.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678470},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:19:09Z","rounded_local_amount":84404.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207337},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":84404.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624671},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":84404.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740368},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84404.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468044848}],"funded_date":"2013-03-22T19:45:57Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T16:37:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alistair Assheton","image":1674519}},{"id":539937,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La clienta vive en Guayaquil.

Ramatou has been trading condiments for over thirty years, since she was very young and alongside her mother.\r\nWith a view to better meeting the needs of her ever-growing customer base, she decided to join the credit program at Soro Yiriwaso approximately seven years ago. Since then she has had several group loans with a women's association in Kadiolo Noumousso, and is now on her sixth cycle of personal loans - all her previous loans have been fully repaid.\r\nShe wants to use this latest loan from Soro Yiriwaso in order to become a wholesaler in the market where she works - so she can supply the market traders who often have trouble finding supplies. With this loan, she plans to buy twenty crates of tomato concentrate, ten crates of Maggie (stock cubes), five sacks of peppercorns, five sacks of dried onion, five bags of bay leaves and ten cases of mustard - from the 'grand march\u00e9' in Sikasso.\r\nShe plans to resell these goods in bulk - for cash and\/or credit - to her trader colleagues from the new market in M\u00e9dine where she runs her business.

two children. Hosiyat does not have higher education at this time, but she has enrolled in the Pedagogical Institute and simultaneously works in the school. She has a small salary and it's not enough to get by. Her husband went to Russia to find work because of difficulties in finding a job in town. Their family is very young and they are experiencing hardship. They try to be in high spirits because being despond will not change anything in life. Because of the cold winter Hosiyat has come to MDO Arvand for a loan. She used it to buy an oven. This is her main heating supply at home. She is very thankful to this organization for the support in the hard times.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1313335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to purchase of electrical oven.

originally from the municipality of El Sauce. She is a single mother; her daughter goes to the university. Marina has worked as a teacher for 22 years, an activity that has made it possible for her to raise and feed her daughter without her father\u2019s help. She works everyday with love and dedication because her country needs this type of people in order to get ahead and overcome poverty.\r\n\r\nMarina teaches in a small community located 10 km from the municipality. She feels very sad when she sees how poor people are; kids receive class under a tree because there are no concrete buildings. However, what is important is their will to learn to read and write. Besides, a school is made of its students and teachers.\r\n\r\nMarina is asking Kiva investors to finance her loan to pay for her daughter\u2019s university fee and for some school supplies that she needs, since the salary she receives is not enough to cover these expenses. The university is located in Le\u00f3n, so she has to travel there for her lectures.

She has a large family: a husband, three sons, a daughter-in-law, an infant granddaughter and her parents-in-law. Ketevan requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her family business start-up, but had no success. Her loan request was always rejected, because of her low income and her family's poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nUntil recently, the only source of the income for the family was from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where they grow different kinds of vegetables, which are sold locally in open markets. In addition she has newly started a business where she buys and sells clothing. But still, it is hardly enough to buy food for her family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKetevan requested a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions available to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Ketevan will purchase more clothing to sell. She will be able to expand her business and this will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of her family.

She is a mother to her children. She manages her household with the help of her children while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nMaxima operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two people when buying cooked rice and viands (meals) costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMaxima hopes that her business will continue to grow. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

The primary occupation of her family is raising cattle and growing crops. In 2009, Narynkul decided to expand her business by getting into fattening and selling cattle, investing 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS) to make her first purchase of cows.

She also plants 2.12 hectares of land where she grows beans and potatoes.  With the goal of further developing her business, Arzygul has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 to buy 3 dairy cows to increase her income from milk sales.

Many people believe it\u2019s healthier to consume fresh, natural juices that are made on the spot like the ones she makes.  The advantage of consuming such juices is that people are less exposed to harmful products containing conservatives and chemicals that can affect their health.

As a result, the public consumer is getting a much cleaner product.  \r\n\r\nKatherin\u2019s work makes it possible for her to cover food, utility and other costs.
