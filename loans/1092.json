Robert requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe main source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. They own a plot of land, where maize is grown. They also have beehives, with bee colonies, and gather honey. The harvested maize and the honey are sold locally at the markets, so Robert can get a small monthly income with which to feed his family.\r\n\r\nRecently, Robert requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Credo approved his loan request, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Robert will purchase a truck, with which he will start trading in potatoes. He will buy potatoes at the wholesale price, bring them to the capital city, and sell them with the price markup. Robert will use the profit for reinvesting in the same business. This will significantly increase the family income, and they will be able to have better living conditions.

He has built a mall building and he renovated it himself. Now he wants to purchase all the needed equipment and groceries, so he can start his business.  \r\n\r\nLasha is a very hard-working man and he will try his best to make the shop successfully work.

The couple is raising three children, all of whom live in and are currently enrolled in school. The family manages a four-acre cacao farm with around 1,200 trees. \n\nA cacao farmer of 27 years now, Julio says he enjoys every part of the process of farming cacao. A more challenging part of cacao for him is the fermentation and drying, especially in the rainy season. Belize has two seasons \u2013 rainy and dry \u2013 with the rainy season typically going from June to November. The Toledo district receives most rainfall of all of Belize. Moreover, with climate change, the seasonality has become less predictable, with rains occurring in the dry season and vice versa. The family is happy to now be able to sell fresh cacao in place of having to dry it themselves. \n\nFlorentina has been an active participant in farm management. She oversees and organizes harvesting with other ladies in her village, hiring three women to help with harvesting every two weeks during the productive season. Cacao trees in Belize produce all year round, with peak seasons from February through May. Besides caring for the children and helping on the farm, Florentina makes local Maya crafts from woven Jippi Jappa palm leaves. \n\nIn the future, the family hopes to continue improving their cacao farm by expanding and diversifying into other crops that can be planted alongside the cacao trees. An interplanted farm yields some kind of crop all year round, creating more stable income for the farmers. Ideally, the children will finish school and take over the farm. \u201cIf they want, it would nice if they could continue to run the farm business, if not, somebody will take care of it,\u201d Julio told Maya Mountain Cacao laughingly. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to prepare for expanding their farm and to hire help for harvesting. Expanding cacao requires buying and filling bags with topsoil and seeds in order to raise cacao seedlings. Moreover, to prepare land for planting, farmers need to clean the underbrush and mark where the trees will be planted. Seedlings are ready for transplanting into the ground when they have four or more leaves, usually about six months after they are bagged.

connect southern Belize with Guatemala. The family, besides managing 3 acres of cacao, has raised 10 children, five of whom live in at the moment. The children are aged nine to 30, and two of them are still enrolled in school. The older kids have moved out, and some of them have followed their dad\u2019s example and begun their own cacao farms. \n\nWith the help of his wife, Antonio tends to around 1,300 cacao trees that were planted five years back with the help of a local association of cacao growers. Cacao trees typically take about four to five years to become productive, and the family is happy most of their hard work five years ago is now paying back. Antonio says cacao farming is no trouble once the trees are grown and producing. The hardest thing about cacao for Antonio is the two-year period right after planting new trees. \u201cYou have to clean it often, not let the bush cover it, because the branches don\u2019t make it through the bush,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao in perfect English, his second language after the native Maya Mopan language spoken in the village.\n\nBesides cacao, the family grows corn and beans for home use. The two main sources of income for Antonio is a job as security officer for a local airline and cacao. In the future, he hopes to retire from the side job and focus on the farm and possibly expand it. The family puts a lot of focus on providing their children with the opportunity of education. \u201cI put my other three boys to school even without me having a job,\u201d said Antonio, adding that cacao and his job have helped save enough to put the rest of the children through school if they want to. \n\nAntonio is requesting this loan to hire help with cleaning the three acres of cacao. Cleaning is the process of cutting underbrush surrounding cacao trees to clear access to them for harvesting and pruning. Cacao requires shade, and is typically grown among timber trees and underbrush. To keep their farms manageable, cacao farmers in southern Belize clean their fields about three times in a given year. The job at hand for Antonio will require and create about 12 days worth of work in the community. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1319630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"Clean three acres of cacao.

Besides cellular phones, he also sells their accessories, mobile recharging cards, and offers software programming. Mahmoud\u2019s business start-up was difficult due to a lack of capital; however, with his ambition and business-oriented mind, he succeeded.\r\n\r\nMahmoud is applying for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, Al Majmoua.

are all from the same neighborhood. The lady sitting third from the left hand side, wearing a blue sare in the photo is Saroswati who is the leader of the group. Saroswati is a 41-year-old woman married to a worker in Angul district in Odisha, India. The couple has two children who are in school. Saroswati lives with her children and, together with her husband, takes care of all the household expenses. In order to help with all the family expenses, Saroswati has been involved in selling rice to the nearby market and to the dealers of rice in the district super market, for the past eight years.

lives in an agricultural area, in a village far away from the city.  He is married and is raising three children.  He has twelve years of experience in raising livestock.  His father raised livestock and Gulom helped his father since his childhood.  They had one calf that he had to take care of.  He grew up and followed in his father's footsteps.  He started his business with two sheep.  At first he had a hard time, especially in wintertime he had to spend more for livestock feed.  But over time experience proved valuable and Gulom started finding ways to overcome barriers and ways to better expand his business.  Today he has more than 50 heads of livestock.  His wife and three children also take part in the business.  Due to the season he does not want to sell his cows right now, because their prices fell.  Gulom needs additional resources to buy livestock feed.  With this goal he turned to MDO Arvand for a loan.  He plans to use the loan to buy livestock feed.

He is married and has three children.  Bokijon raises livestock at home and also sells milk.  He has a milk cow at home that produces 12 liters of milk daily.  His wife does not have a job, she takes care of the livestock, makes dairy products and sells to her neighbors and acquaintances.

It is the first funding he has sought with the Foundation of Mario Santo Domingo which he requires to be able to produce living room, dining room, and bedroom sets, as well as doors and closets.  Javier is a married man and father of three grown children that organized his own cabinet-making workshop in the patio of his home.  This also functions as a small storeroom for his wife's miscellaneous items.  He learned this cabinetry work when he was very young, as his father also did woodworking.

The 12 of them, 10 women and 2 men, are farmers in Kakamega North District. Farming inputs will be delivered to him on credit consisting of the necessary materials to plant \u00bd acre of millet and sorghum. Justus joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. Justus joined One Acre Fund so that he could access the best input prices and grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Justus was only able to harvest three bags of maize per acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, he was able to harvest five bags per acre!

He is a caring father of five children and a loving husband.  For the last 25 years, from his early childhood, he has worked as a rancher.  His grandfather and father were butchers.  Shamsiddin continues on in the footsteps and also became a butcher.  This allows him to earn extra income.  Since he has a large family, he needs to have multiple sources of income.  He skillfully combines breeding, butchery, and farming activities. Basically, he breeds, raises and sells cattle.  This is his main source of income that provides for his family, his children's education and general living expenses.  Shamsiddin and his wife try also to set aside for their children's univeristy tuition.  Using his experience and seasoned skills, he would like to buy an additional cow and feed for his cattle.  But he doesn't not want to use his savings since it will be difficult to rebuild them.  He turned to Arvand for a loan to help.  He hopes his plans come to fruition.

For the past 3 years, Eresi has been working hard to manage her retail shop, where she sells rice, sugar and busiquetes.\r\nTo help expand her business, Eresi has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more items such as rice to sell, and will help Eresi generate greater profits and provide her family with their basic needs. Eresi hopes that in the future she will be able to own a wholesale shop.\r\nEresi is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Rebeca naci\u00f3 en un hogar con escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos, por lo que se educ\u00f3 en la escuela primaria, naci\u00f3 en Macar\u00e1 \u2013 Ecuador, por circunstancias ajenas a su voluntad,  ahora reside junto con su pareja e hijo en el Cant\u00f3n Los Bancos en la zona rural de la Provincia de Pichincha en el Ecuador. En este cant\u00f3n se puede encontrar varios lugares para visitar como r\u00edos y bosques que son visitados por varios turistas, quienes al coincidir en las fiestas del cant\u00f3n pueden experimentar las exposiciones de artesan\u00edas y las ferias donde se exponen productos agr\u00edcolas y tambi\u00e9n ganado que son animales que conforman la riqueza de muchos habitantes. Estas actividades combinadas con el comercio han dado la oportunidad a la empresa privada para construir hoteles, hoster\u00edas y varias ofertas de servicios para turistas. Sin embargo la principal actividad de este pueblo es la agricultura y ganader\u00eda que cada a\u00f1o permiten que el \u00edndice de rendimiento econ\u00f3mico suba cada a\u00f1o a pesar de la poca transferencia de tecnolog\u00eda al lugar. En medio de llanuras, paisajes y monta\u00f1as, los habitantes de este lugar aprovechan cada oportunidad o necesidad de los visitantes y de quienes les rodean para llevar a cabo sus ideas de negocio que cada d\u00eda crecen y aportan al crecimiento del sector. \nRebeca trabaja desde hace varios a\u00f1os en su tienda de art\u00edculos de primera necesidad. Aprendi\u00f3 con la experiencia de su familia y ahora quiere incrementar su negocio comprando productos que surtan su oferta. Ella sue\u00f1a con alg\u00fan d\u00eda poder comprar un terreno que le permita dedicarse a la crianza de pollos. Para esto ella trabaja cada d\u00eda atendiendo su tienda hasta 14 horas diarias desde que sale el sol hasta la noche. Aunque la competencia es grande, Rebeca espera que sus ingresos aumenten y as\u00ed mejorar el estilo de vida de su hogar. Conjuntamente con Rebeca se han unido familiares amigos quienes poseen el mismo esp\u00edritu emprendedor de ella y desean sobresalir en sus actividades de negocio. As\u00ed se describe a Alba y Florinda; quienes se dedican a la crianza de pollos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n y cada una espera incrementar sus ingresos comprando pollos, balanceado y mejorando los criaderos. Florinda tiene 2 hijos que estudian y es soltera, tiene 37 a\u00f1os.  Alba en cambio tiene ya 56 a\u00f1os y no tuvo oportunidad de estudiar y ha atravesado muchos obst\u00e1culos por su analfabetismo, tiene 2 hijos adolescentes que estudian. Otra de las integrantes de este grupo es Laura de 31 a\u00f1os que tiene 2 hijos de 17 y 6 a\u00f1os, es soltera y se dedica a la venta de pl\u00e1tanos y choclos asados en un puesto que instala en medio de la calle. La dificultad m\u00e1s grande que tiene cada d\u00eda es trasladar su parrilla, mesa y recipientes desde el lugar de venta hasta su casa. Utilizar\u00e1 el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar herramientas e insumos que mejoren su trabajo.  Estas mujeres se han unido para conseguir un cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde aparte de confianza y agilidad, recibieron de su ejecutivo herramientas importantes para el crecimiento de sus negocios. Agradecen la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva para que alrededor del mundo se sumen personas para hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os. ","en":"Rebeca is 60 years old, is not married, and works hard every day to support her 16 year old child who is in high school. Rebeca was born to a poor family, and so she left education after primary school, for reasons beyond her control. She was born in Macar\u00e1, Ecuador, and now lives with her partner and son in Los Bancos Cant\u00f3n in a rural area of the Province of Pichincha. There are many places to visit in this Canton, such as rivers and forests, which attract many tourists. If these tourists visit during the regional festivals, they can see handicraft exhibitions and fairs with agricultural produce and livestock, which contribute to the livelihoods of many inhabitants. These activities, combined with trade, have provided private business opportunities in the form of hotels, hostels, and various tourism services.\r\n\r\nHowever, the principal activity of this area is agriculture and livestock, which allow the rate of economic performance to increase every year, despite the lack of technology in the region. In the midst of meadows, countryside and mountains, the inhabitants of this place make the most of every opportunity or the needs of visitors and neighbors to turn their continuous business ideas into reality, which contributes to the growth of the sector. \r\n\r\nRebeca has worked for several years in her grocery store. She learned this trade from her family and now wants to grow her business, buying new stock. She has a dream that, one day, she will be able to buy a plot of land to raise chickens. It is for this reason that she works in her store every for up to 14 hours at a time, from sunrise to night. Although there is a lot of competition, Rebeca hopes to increase her profits and improve her family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nFriends with the same enterprising spirit who want to succeed in their business activities have joined her. Their names are Alba and Florinda, and they work raising chickens to sell and hope to increase their earnings buying chickens and chicken feed, and making improvements to their cages. Florinda has two children who study, is single, and is 37 years old. Alba, meanwhile, is 56, never had the chance to study, and has overcome many hurdles due to her illiteracy. She has two teenage children who study. \r\n\r\nAnother member of this group is Laura, who is 31 years old and has two children aged 17 and six. She is single and makes a living selling bananas and corn on a stall in the street. The biggest challenge she faces every day is to transport her barbeque, table and containers from her stall to her home. She will use the loan to buy tools and supplies to improve her work. \r\n\r\nThese women have come together to request a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, where, apart from trust and flexibility, they have received important tools to grow their businesses. They are grateful for Kiva's help enabling people around the world to make their dreams reality."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1317545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to increase the stock of products in their business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-23T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-22T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebeca Ufracia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flerida Alba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda Fidelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura Clemencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1054.4,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":160.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":171.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":175.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":178.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":182.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":185.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.62},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.59,"local_amount":160.46,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":163.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524935},{"amount":175.04,"local_amount":171.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":175.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133239},{"amount":178.95,"local_amount":175.52,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":178.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313778},{"amount":182.35,"local_amount":178.86,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":182.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565383},{"amount":185.62,"local_amount":182.06,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":185.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814422},{"amount":189.45,"local_amount":185.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":189.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320595}],"funded_date":"2013-03-26T03:32:32Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":541143,"name":"Santa Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

","en":"Qobiljon is a jack of all trades. He is as adept at dealing with people as he is with building materials. With the forest at his feet and a palette and paintbrush in his hands, he creates beauty. He is also very skilled in the field of animal husbandry, as he has 20 years of experience raising livestock. He is married and has 2 children. Because he himself was unable to get a good education when he was younger, he now wants his kids to grow up educated.  To achieve his goal, he works very hard, sparing no effort to earn a living and to save for a brighter future for his children and family. He has several head of sheep. Every time he sells an adult sheep, he buys a young one, and in this way, he earns an income. Currently at this point in the season, he does not want to sell his sheep since the prices for livestock have fallen slightly. In order to realise his plans, Qobiljon is seeking a loan to buy livestock and feed. He is really hoping for assistance from Kiva and is thankful in advance for the support. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1312028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"for the purchase of livestock and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-03-23T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-22T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Qobiljon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2541.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":528.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":546.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":528.54,"local_amount":2458.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751975},{"amount":546.46,"local_amount":2541.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616052}],"funded_date":"2013-03-23T19:18:47Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":540391,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fresh fish to fry and sell.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-03-23T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-22T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":185.85,"local_amount":354,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":359.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364730709},{"amount":45.15,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372901763},{"amount":159.08,"local_amount":303,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:46:46Z","rounded_local_amount":307.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381677754}],"funded_date":"2013-03-23T15:37:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":541161,"name":"Olivo Floresmilo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olivo tiene 62 a\u00f1os de edad es casado tiene 8 hijos vive en el cant\u00f3n de Chillanes de la Provincia Bol\u00edvar. \n\nOlivo pertenecia a la ventanilla rural Progreso Comunitario pero por motivos de desintegraci\u00f3n del grupo realiza el cr\u00e9dito solo. \n\nOlivo se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz y cacao.

He fattens cattle for a living and has a lot of experience in this field. He also grows agricultural crops. He is married and has 4 children who are in school. His wife works in the farming sector. The combined incomes of Valijon and his wife are only sufficient to cover the family's expenses. The children are growing up, and there will be post-secondary education to be paid for and weddings to be hosted. Covering these costs will require a large outlay of money, and for this reason, Valijon has approached Arvand for a loan. He wants to purchase cattle for the further expansion of his herd which will give him an opportunity to increase his income, and to realise his plans.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1312588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

Iv\u00e1n is a member of the El Ayle group. He explains that they chose this name because at the place where they meet there is a large Ayle tree, and this way, they wouldn't forget the group name. He says that he has worked with the group for around three and a half years, and that little by little, his business has improved. \r\n\r\nPreviously, he explains, he just bought and sold fruit and vegetables, which he purchased from his community and sold in the town of Tuxpan. Now, he grows his own fruit because his father gave him a large plot which has roughly 80 avocado trees, 20 peach trees and blackberries. He says that his fruit sells well, as he sells avocados by the tonne and people visit his orchard to buy them. He says, \u201cMy name is becoming known as I sell very high-quality fruit and this pleases my customers. I am very grateful to VisionFund for helping me with the loans, because it means I can buy what I need to improve my trees\u201d. \r\n\r\nToday, Iv\u00e1n is requesting a loan to buy supplies, as his trees have small fruit and May and June are harvest season. He recounts that during harvest time, he pays local people to help him gather the avocados and peaches. Iv\u00e1n's dream is to continue expanding his orchard because through large amounts of effort he has managed to make it succeed.

She says that she has already completed several loan cycles with VisionFund in the group called \"El Eucalipto\" (The Eucalyptus), and that she likes how the lending agency works. She says, \"The payments have not been hard to make, and apart from that, I have the opportunity to save and to stock my grocery store.\"\r\n\r\nShe says that she has had a small grocery store in her community for 20 years and that it was one of the first that existed in her town. She is asking for this loan to improve her shop. Although it is small, she keeps it very well stocked. It is in her home and her spouse built a little room out of wood so that she could put her business there. She wanted to start this type of business because she didn't have a stable job since she hadn't studied beyond primary school, and she couldn't find work elsewhere. Since she saw that there weren't any shops close to her home, she decided to start one. \r\n\r\nShe buys her products in different shops in the town of Zitacuaro, where they give her low prices. With the loan she is requesting, she wants to stock her shop with items like eggs, bleach, sugar, milk, beans, toilet paper, tissues, lightbulbs, napkins, soft drinks, snacks, bread, cookies, canned chiles, tuna, sardines, mayonnaise and cream. She also wants to get tomatoes, onions, serrano chiles and manzano chiles, which she says she will buy at the wholesale food market in Zitacuaro.\r\n\r\nSanta's goal is to be able to build her shop out of a material that won't get ruined by the weather. The other group members are named Mar\u00eda Margarita, Elvira, Lilia, Fausto, Ma. de los \u00c1ngeles, Cleotilde, Virginia, Camerina and Mar\u00eda Guadalupe. They will invest in their businesses and buy fruits and legumes from the region, items for grocery stores, and jewelry items to

They live with and depend on her and her husband. As a family, they work in farming and grow coffee when they are done with their school activities. She has a postsecondary education and has a University Technician degree (a one and a half to three year program) in social intervention, which she uses as a primary school teacher. She learned farming from her parents at a very young age, since they were the ones who taught her how to grow coffee and had dedicated their whole lives to it. She and her husband have been growing coffee for more than 7 years. The crop is located 20 minutes from her house, and they travel there by car. Her product is sold in the area where she lives to middlemen, neighbors, family members, and friends.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is asking for help to buy fertilizer, manure, and crop sprayer pumps for her coffee crop, since it tends to become infested with insects and affected by diseases such as coffee rust if not given the appropriate maintenance.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to increase her crops in order to earn more, thus giving her children a better future and allowing her to support them in their studies. She also dreams that they will be able to reach their potential by attending college, which will help them to implement technology for their crops, since this is the asset they will inherit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1317664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer, manure, and crop sprayer pumps for her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-03-23T16:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-22T16:20:07Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida Idalisis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1475,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":29087,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895274}],"funded_date":"2013-03-24T15:38:36Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":540516,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet lives in the Mombasa area of Coast Province, Kenya.

He identifies with that work a great deal.\r\n\r\nThe season for the cacao harvest is in the coming months, and this is a good business opportunity for merchants like him.  He therefore needs to have the capital for the normal performance of his work.  This is his first Kiva loan, and he is very grateful for the financial support he gets in order to continue with his work. \r\n\r\nHe now needs 4,000 soles to buy organic cacao because the harvest time is nearing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1318704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic cacao.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-23T16:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-22T16:30:08Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":427.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":461.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":473.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":493.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":508.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":526.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":547.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":561.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":165.5,"local_amount":427.1,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":429.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578020},{"amount":179.6,"local_amount":463.49,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":466.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530248},{"amount":182.56,"local_amount":471.11,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":473.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975279},{"amount":191.34,"local_amount":493.79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":496.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996545},{"amount":197.05,"local_amount":508.52,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":511.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864027},{"amount":205.75,"local_amount":530.98,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":533.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352371},{"amount":428.2,"local_amount":1105.01,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1111.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904257}],"funded_date":"2013-03-26T22:24:03Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":540540,"name":"Rhoda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rhoda is a 39-year-old widow with five children living in Bundibugyo, Uganda.

She lives in the company of her husband Geremias in the house that they inherited 30 years ago. In spite of her advanced age, she and her husband continue working in agriculture. \"I really like working in the fields, I feel strong and want to get ahead, and also I plant in the natural way like our parents taught us to do,\" she says.

He lives in the house he inherited 19 years ago with his wife Mar\u00eda and two sons, Cristian and Luis, whom they care for. Ten years ago, he began working as a locksmith, a difficult profession to undertake in his town because there was little need to remodel doors and windows. Slowly, he built a client base, and now he is contracted to make and place the metal accessories in every building or remodeling project. His workshop is in his house, where he works without a break until he has finished his orders. \r\n\r\nHe wants to improve his business and be able to fill more orders by buying better equipment. This is his first loan cycle with KIVA. He is grateful for the support and promises to make his payments on time.

Thanks to her husband's business, she can get cows at a good price. She has 4 dairy cows and quality goats. She says that one of the cows is pregnant and so her milk production will decrease and she needs to supplement the reduction in milk production. Because she is intelligent, she thought that she could replace the pregnant cow with another one so she wouldn't have to worry about the reduction in milk production. She also promises to be punctual in her repayments. Ang\u00e9lica needs $1475 dollars to buy a new cow that she needs to maintain her milk production. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1318850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase a cow.

When his wife was meant to start her higher education, she was not able to due to financial limitations.  When the opportunity finally materialized, she felt uncomfortable returning to school since she was older than the other students.  So now she raises their wonderful children and helps her husband.  Asatillo has worked with livestock for many years.  He buys the animals, fattens and slaughters them, and sells at a local market.  He treats his livestock well and isn't stingy with his efforts or his feed.  From the time he started his business, and continuing on to the present day, he has had many customers for his meat.  Besides the meat, he also sells dairy products (milk, yogurt, sour cream).  He receives a good income from his livestock.  Asatillo has turned to Arvand for a loan.  With these funds, he plans to buy livestock that will increase his income.  He is grateful to Arvand for the assistance and the big role Arvand plays in his

She gets up very early in the morning (4am) with her parents in order to make her delicious breads and when the bread is ready, she puts it in baskets to sell to the people of Zitacuaro, at the central bus station and the central area to purchase groceries. She says that every since she was small, her parents taught her how to make bread and since she wasn't able to go to more school, she decided to help her parents make and sell bread. She says that 7 years ago she branched out on her own and now she makes her own bread and she sells it on her own. And even though her father lets her use his oven, she buys her own firewood and supplies to make her bread. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan with Visi\u00f3n Fund in order to improve her business and to purchase more supplies she needs in order to make bread. If she gets the loan, she will use it to purchase flour, butter, egg, milk, sugar, colorings and creams since she makes breads with different flavors and different leavening. She says that she would like to get the loan as soon as possible so that she can make more bread. She says she is happy working with the group Nueva Vida (New Life) because it is a group that gets things done and repays their loans on time, also, when one group member can't make their loan payment, the group comes together to find the funds to help that individual. \r\n \r\nThe other members of the group are Marivel, Laura, Mar\u00eda del Rocio, Roc\u00edo del Carmen, Gerardo \u00c1ngel, Alejandro, Mar\u00eda Catalina, Mar\u00eda Elena, Ofelia and Francisco, they will invest their loans in purchasing supplies to make and sell hand-made tortillas, purchase mattresses and sheets, candies to resell in a grocery store, to purchase parts to maintain a public transportation vehicle and to purchase sweet corn and supplies to prepare the corn and sell it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*In the picture: behind the lady in red is her daughter who is not a member of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6675,"image":{"id":1312899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase flour, butter, eggs, milk, firewood, sugar, colorings and creams.

lives in a rural village called Isfara.  He's thirty years old, married and has three children.  He was not able to receive a higher education since his family has dealt with financial hardship since his childhood.  After he finished school, he began working with an acquaintance who worked baking cakes.  Initially, he worked a supplier, buying flour, oil, and other necessary ingredients for cakes.  His mentor saw that Mahmudhuja had a desire work together so he invited him to do so.  Mahmudhuja didn't refuse the offer.  He was very happy to be able to increase his family's income.  After some time working together, Mahmudhuja rented a building from which to sell their goods.  This was difficult since he was required to use his initial capital on rent.  However, he was not discouraged and tried to work from morning until late into the night.  Today, his cakes are in high demand.  Mahmudhuja has turned to Arvand for a loan in order to buy more of the raw ingredients he needs to increase his production.  He is grateful to Arvand for the financial support and

","en":"Subhon lives in Isfara, he's married, forty years old, and has one child.  He was not able to receive a higher education since his family has faced financial hardship since he was young.  He followed in the footsteps of his father.  As a boy, he helped his dad with baking and selling cakes at market.  In 1991, he began baking independently.  Initially, it was very difficult since he needed capital.  He was advised by friends to take a loan out with Arvand.  He has big plans for the future.  Because he wants his child to have a higher education he tries to do everything he needs to to make this goal happen.

Her oldest child is sponsored by World Vision Mexico. For two years, Lucina has been working for the cooperative primary school in her community. Her town is located in an indigenous area within the limits of the state of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, a beautiful place with pretty landscapes that can be seen surrounding the community. \r\n\r\nShe says that in the cooperative, she makes lunches as well as Mexican \"antojitos\" (corn-based snacks) such as tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, pambazos, and flavored water, which she sells to students and teachers at the primary school. She says that she is going to stock up with the ingredients she buys in the city of Zitacuaro, because in the central supply store she can find better prices and then earn a profit. She also says that she sells sweets and soft drinks in different flavors, and that she is applying for this loan to buy ingredients to make the food and \"antojitos\" which she will sell to the schoolchildren. \r\n\r\nShe says that she cooks the meat, makes sauces and slices and disinfects tomatoes, onions, and lettuce one day early. Very early the next day, she makes the stews and antojitos so that she can be ready to sell her food during the recess at 9:30. She also sells food during the lunch hour, at 2pm, and during the recess for students in the evening shift at 4pm. She says that she has two girls who help her to serve the food because she can't keep up by herself. She is grateful for this loan because she can stock her business and she will have the ingredients to make her food. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Domitila, Gabriela, Eriqueta, Martha, Laura, Sebastiana, Ivon and Hilda. They will use this loan to buy ingredients for Mexican antojitos, to buy materials to embroider tablecloths and napkins to sell, to buy sheep and the feed to raise and sell them, to buy goods to stock a grocery store, and to buy feed for chickens and turkeys to raise and sell them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6175,"image":{"id":1312248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She currently lives alone in her own home, constructed many years ago by her ex-husband. Juana makes a living cultivating corn, potatoes, and peas on the land which she inherited from her parents. She works alone. She likes planting alfalfa the most because after cutting the plants, they grow much more and they can last 3 years with good production. \"You have to water them every 8 days,\" she says. At the same time she is raising 150 guinea pigs in her home, which she sells wholesale for human consumption.

Thus she will continue working and making an effort to achieve her biggest dream of being able to provide a good education to her children, since she wishes to see them become successful professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1318924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy vegetables for sale such as cucumber, peppers, lettuce and tubers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-23T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-22T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia Fidela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":131.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":141.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":144.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":151.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":155.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":161.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":169.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":174.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":182.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":188.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":195.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":204.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.79,"local_amount":131.06,"processed_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":131.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483397},{"amount":54.65,"local_amount":141.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:30:55Z","rounded_local_amount":141.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889432},{"amount":55.86,"local_amount":144.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":144.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664332},{"amount":58.81,"local_amount":151.77,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":152.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775697},{"amount":60.31,"local_amount":155.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":156.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779064},{"amount":62.66,"local_amount":161.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":162.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054242},{"amount":65.65,"local_amount":169.42,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":170.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819168},{"amount":366.27,"local_amount":945.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":950.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472142}],"funded_date":"2013-03-25T11:15:07Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carrie N.","image":1077468}},{"id":540640,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilou is 52 years old.

capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Her husband has been working as a carpenter at a private business entity since 2012 and before this job, he was working in Korea on an employment contract from 2007 to 2012. She herself has been working as a beauty specialist for two years and has accumulated a vast amount of experience in this service field. Her two children both go to high school. The house the family lives in has been deteriorating over the past years since its construction in 1995 and needs some serious repairs and extensions.  She is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as fiberglass, bricks, planks and foams. Then the family can live in a comfortable and warm place and will burn less coal. This will contribute to the efforts against air pollution by emitting less smoke. The borrower is very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

is a 33 year old woman who lives in the city of Ica, in the district of Parcona, with her two children whom she loves very much and who are her reason for living. She is a very friendly person, hardworking and enthusiastic. She dedicates all her effort to helping her family get ahead, since she is both mother and father to her children. Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources, and because she needed to work from the time she was very young, Doris wasn\u2019t able to study a professional career. She would have liked very much to do so. In her free time she likes to watch television, and on occasion she likes to cook a delicious rice with chicken to share with her family.\r\n\r\nBy her own initiative, and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Doris works in her small kiosk where she sells breakfasts and other foods. She works at a school in her city, where she rents a small space to provide her services. Doris works every day for approximately 10 hours and she thinks things have gone well for her because of the friendly treatment she provides her customers. \r\n\r\nDoris is very thankful to the Kiva lenders since it is through their help that she will be able to buy the merchandise she needs to stock her business, such as sweets, soft drinks, mineral water, and other things. This way she will continue working hard to achieve her dream of having a great restaurant.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1318938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy merchandise for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-24T00:30:36Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-23T00:30:36Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Hermelinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.74},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":87.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":91.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":94.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":98.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":102.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.53,"local_amount":66.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":68.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483399},{"amount":28.07,"local_amount":70.17,"processed_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":72.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889434},{"amount":28.7,"local_amount":71.74,"processed_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:34Z","rounded_local_amount":74.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664334},{"amount":30.24,"local_amount":75.62,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":78.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775701},{"amount":31.04,"local_amount":77.59,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779066},{"amount":32.27,"local_amount":80.68,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":83.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054244},{"amount":33.85,"local_amount":84.61,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":87.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819170},{"amount":189.3,"local_amount":473.26,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":491.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472144}],"funded_date":"2013-03-24T21:14:17Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":540668,"name":"Merineza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of three children, Merineza works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business buying and selling nipa (woven palm mats used for house repair and construction) in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from selling ready to wear.

","en":"The communal bank \"BIBOSI\" is composed of 8 members - 6 women and 2 men. The President of this group, Dora, is 26 years old and works selling clothing. She does not have a fixed place from which she sells, but rather sells by visiting different neighborhoods and passing through fairs and markets, offering her merchandise as she goes. This loan is her first with the institution. \r\n\r\nDora plans to use her loan to buy this season's clothing in bulk, in order to stock her business. She will buy a lot of sweaters as the weather is starting to get cold. One of Dora's biggest challenges in her business is that she has to walk a lot in order to sell her merchandise, and she would like to use the profits from the goods she sells in order to invest in a fixed market stall. Her dream is to be able to continue selling her clients the variety of merchandise that they demand. Dora is very happy and grateful to this institution for the help it has provided her, and is also very grateful for the other members of her group, all of whom are working very hard to get their families ahead.

Olinda and her family live in her Aunt's house, located on a rural farm. Olinda works in agriculture, and has some of her own land where she plants peas, potatoes and corn. Olinda tells us that sometimes with her corn harvest she is only able to recover what she has invested, due to the frosts and pests that affect this crop. However, she also tells us that she does not have the same problem with peas. Additionally, she receives further income from selling guinea pigs, which started raising  5 years ago. Now, Olinda is planning to bring her eldest son to Lima so he can begin to study there. This is one of the reasons why she is working so hard to get ahead and improve her income. This month she will begin planting more peas, and as a result is requesting this loan to purchase the seeds. This is Olinda's 6th loan with Kiva, and she is very dedicated to paying all monthly loan quotas on time.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling items piece by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nNelia is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her to continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nNelia dreams of expanding her business: she hopes that they will have their own house and lot.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and from there she also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She takes good care of the hens and is very determined to raise them and later sell them at the weekend. She chooses which ones she will sell and takes them to the local businesses. Rebeca has seen that this work has been a huge financial help for her family and it allows her to organise her own schedule. As a result she would like to continue this work so that she can grow financially. Rebeca will invest the 2000 Nuevo Soles in buying hens so that she can sell in bulk. Rebeca is very happy to have financial support as she has always shown herself to be responsible when it comes to repayments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1319400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy hens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-24T08:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-23T08:40:07Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebeca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":280.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":314.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":325.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":341.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":360.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":376.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.74},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.74,"local_amount":280.62,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":281.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578030},{"amount":121.93,"local_amount":314.65,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":315.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530258},{"amount":125.96,"local_amount":325.07,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":326.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975288},{"amount":132.48,"local_amount":341.87,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":343.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996555},{"amount":139.81,"local_amount":360.81,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":362.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864036},{"amount":146.08,"local_amount":376.98,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":378.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352379}],"funded_date":"2013-03-24T13:36:31Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":541670,"name":"Wuidmer Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Wuidmer tiene 40 a\u00f1os, vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su esposa con la cual procrearon 1 hijo y reside en San Juan Pueblo, municipio Esparta, Atl\u00e1ntida.\nDon Wuidmer su negocio es una pulper\u00eda donde ofrece a los clientes productos como granos b\u00e1sicos, carnes, l\u00e1cteos, refrescos, embutidos, productos de abarroter\u00eda etc. En el negocio tambi\u00e9n es ayudado por su esposa a atender los clientes.

She got her first loan from Arvand in 2003. At present, her business is stable and her range of goods is larger. She is 38 years old, and unfortunately, she is a widow, so she supports her family on her own. She has 2 children, a son and a daughter. She works 30 days a month without any days off so that her children never want for money. Oysara is now seeking a loan to expand her business which will allow her to earn a larger profit.
