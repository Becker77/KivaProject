40 years old, married, and has 3 children. A few years ago, she was working on a poultry farm and her husband was an electrician, but circumstances changed and they were both left unemployed. Her husband decided to get into fattening cattle because it could provide an income, albeit a modest one. At that time, their children were small and the family earnings were sufficient, but now the kids are older and finances are tight. Their dream is to build their own house since they are currently living with Gulchehra's parents-in-law, but as their children grow, it will be too crowded for all of them. Gulchehra does not want to sell their cattle as they bring in earnings that will allow  a little work to begin on the house. This is why she is planning to purchase more cattle so that her husband can sell them for a larger profit in a few months' time. Gulchehra and her husband are really hoping for assistance from Kiva in the form of a loan that will help them to buy cattle.

He works every day for approximately 10 hours and he thinks it is going well for him because he knows the areas where the most passengers are.\r\n\r\nOscar is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he will be able to cover the school expenses of his young children, such as registration fees and school supplies. This way, Oscar will be able to give his children the materials they need to do their studies. He will continue to work and strive to achieve his dream of having his own transportation business.

He is married but does not yet have children. He has a cow and calf that he keeps at home. The cow gives about 10-12 litres of milk per day. His wife is the one who mainly takes care of the cattle, while Sadriddin sells mineral fertilizer for a living.

","en":"Anar is 54 years old, married, and has raised 5 now-grown children. She has a post-secondary education and is a teacher of German. For 28 years, she worked as a teacher and was awarded the title of \"Excellent Educator.\" As a means of supplementary income, she works as a bookkeeper for a municipal organisation. In 1995, Anar got into animal husbandry as the main source of earnings for the family. She started this business with a sum of only 15,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS), and today it brings in around 12,000 Som per month. For the purpose of further developing her business, Anar has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 Som to purchase 15 sheep and 1 bull. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to expand her farm. In the future, she wants to build a house and host a wedding for her son. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1319020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 15 sheep and 1 bull","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyrgyzstan village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-24T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-23T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":48.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":30236.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426870},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":30236.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552928},{"amount":1213.59,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":60473.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":48.91,"payment_id":542440128}],"funded_date":"2013-03-26T17:07:56Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":540758,"name":"Ganbayar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Ganbayar is 23 years old, and lives with his siblings and parents in a house in Uvs province of Mongolia.

Joseph joined One Acre Fund so that he could access the best prices and because One Acre Fund delivers its supplies early.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Joseph was only able to harvest 6.5 bags of maize per 1 acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, he was able to harvest 30 bags per acre! He plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and invest in livestock. Joseph's group members will each receive loans of \u00bd acre during the 2013 Long Rains season. In total they will receive supplies for 8 acres of maize and sorghum.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1313306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of millet sorghum and sweet potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-03-24T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-23T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felisters","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lenah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":52800,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":53549.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602821}],"funded_date":"2013-03-25T20:12:12Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:24:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":541756,"name":"Bernab\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bernab\u00e9 es originario de la comarca Chaguitillo Sebaco, su estado civil es casado tiene dos hijos en edad escolar.

As the main breadwinner of the family, for many years she has been working in animal husbandry, having started this business with a sum of 40,000 Kyrgyzstan Som. Thanks to her hard work, today her farm includes 2 cows and 3 horses, and she works a 2.88 hectare plot of land every year. The sale of milk and agricultural produce brings in earnings of around 12,000 Som per month. For the purpose of further developing her business, Kaldykyz has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som to buy 4 heifers for 20,000 Som each, 10,000 Som worth of fuel, and 10,000 Som worth of bean seeds so that she can increase her income from selling milk, dairy products, and agricultural produce.

She finished primary school, and then she helped out in her home. When she was very young, she married Vincent, a farmer who is now 50 and with whom she had five children, of whom only one depends on his parents. Now Aida lives with her husband and their son in the Valle Hermoso parish of the Santo Domingo canton in Ecuador. Valle Hermoso is a rural parish where there are approximately ten thousand residents. It is the setting for lovers of extreme sports, since its waterfalls and rivers are the natural resources most suitable for this. It is a location with a warm climate, and its inhabitants have an impressive entrepreneurial spirit. Visitors to this place come from all the provinces, tourists as well as business people, thanks to the fact that Santo Domingo is a point of commercial exchange between the coastal and mountain regions of the country, and it has had a very renowned sustainable growth in recent years.\r\n\r\nAida has worked raising pigs for 8 years. The work consists of looking for food for the pigs, feeding them, keeping them clean, and periodically checking on their state of health, to later sell them. Aida hopes to grow economically so that the style of living in her home can improve and thus she can accomplish having her youngest son successfully complete his studies. She needs a loan with which she can buy a pair of mother pigs to raise and breed with the male pigs that she now has so that they can give birth to baby pigs to raise or also to sell at the animal fair. The obstacle that prevented Aida from taking this decision earlier was the difficulty in finding financing at other financial institutions. Now, with the help of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, she will be able to finance this step of growth in her business, since in addition to receiving the loan in a rapid and secure manner, they will also train her so that she can be a better administrator of her resources.

His loan requests were rejected  because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from trading. Kakhaber has a mini-bus. He goes to the capital city for purchasing factory dairy products at wholesale price. He brings the products to his district to distribute in the local shops with a price markup and earns a small monthly income. \r\nKakhaber requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor. They do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit,Kakhaber will purchase a car from abroad at a low cost, bring it to Georgia and resell it at a good price. This will give him a good profit which Kakhaber wants to reinvest to start a car business. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

For many years, she has been earning a living by growing crops. After the yearly harvest is complete, Roza, her husband, and their older children go to Bishkek to make money, and in the spring, the couple work a 4-hectare plot of land where they grow beans and potatoes. Thanks to Roza's hard work, her farm is well-developed and generates an annual income of 150,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS) from the sale of produce. For the purpose of further developing her business, Roza has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 60,000 Som so she can prepare for spring planting.

","en":"Mahabat is 33 years old, married, and has 4 children, the youngest of whom is a 1-year-old girl. As the main source of income for the family, Mahabat raises cattle and grows crops. She has a 0.5 hectare plot of land and rents more, where each year she plants beans and potatoes. Thanks to her hard work and the efforts of her family, today her farm includes 3 dairy cows and 1 horse. A monthly income of 6,000 Som is generated by the sale of milk and dairy products, and the sale of beans brings in around 120,000 Som annually. The money earned from the sale of produce allows her to purchase sheep and bulls at the end of the season.

Se cas\u00f3 muy joven, matrimonio del cual tuvo 5 hijos que ahora ya no dependen de ella, pues todos son mayores de edad e independientes. Al pasar el tiempo su matrimonio se deterior\u00f3 y no hubo m\u00e1s salida que el divorcio, situaci\u00f3n que caus\u00f3 un baj\u00f3n muy grande en la vida de Pastora porque ten\u00eda que resignarse a pasar el resto de su vida sola. Sin embargo, esta mujer comenz\u00f3 desde cero y con el apoyo de sus hijos decidi\u00f3 salir adelante trabajando, y disfrutando su vida. Ahora vive en la Parroquia Valle Hermoso del cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo en Ecuador. Valle Hermoso es una parroquia rural en donde hay aproximadamente diez mil habitantes, es el escenario para los amantes de los deportes extremos, pues sus cascadas y r\u00edos son los recursos naturales m\u00e1s adecuados para esto. Es un sitio con clima c\u00e1lido y sus habitantes tienen un esp\u00edritu emprendedor impresionante como es el caso de Pastora que desde hace 2 a\u00f1os se dedic\u00f3 a la crianza de ganado vacuno para la posterior venta. Esta mujer atiende todos los d\u00edas a las vacas ase\u00e1ndolas y aliment\u00e1ndolas para que no presenten enfermedades y puedan ser vendidas a buen precio. La falta de capital ha sido su mayor obst\u00e1culo para que su negocio gire alrededor solo de un par de vacas. Ahora gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva podr\u00e1 obtener un pr\u00e9stamo financiado por varias personas alrededor del mundo que creen en ella y con quienes Pastora est\u00e1 muy gradecida, pues cuenta que con este pr\u00e9stamo comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s vacas para as\u00ed tener un crecimiento con su negocio y poder ofertar m\u00e1s seguido en el mercado de animales.","en":"Pastora is 50 years old.  She has been working since she was a girl as she could not continue her education after primary school.  She married young and had five children, all of whom are now independent adults.  Over time, Pastora's marriage deteriorated and there was little else to do but divorce.  This was a very low point in Pastora's life as she had to resign herself to spending the rest of her life alone.  However, having started at zero, her children supported her and she decided to try to move ahead in life and enjoy herself.  She now lives in the Valle Hermoso parish in the Santo Domingo district of Ecuador.  Valle Hermoso is a rural parish with around 10,000 inhabitants.  It is here that extreme sports fans come to enjoy the waterfalls and rivers that are the perfect natural resource for them.  The climate is warm and the inhabitants have an impressive enterprising spirit, just like Pastora, who has been making a living raising cattle that she later sells on for the last two years.  Pastora tends to her cattle every day, washing and feeding them so that they do not become ill and can be sold for a good price.  A lack of capital has been her biggest problem, as she only normally has around two cows.  Now, thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva, she will be able to take out a loan financed by various people around the world who believe in her.  Pastora is very grateful to these people as, with this loan, she will be able to buy more cows and so see some growth in her business and she will be able to sell at the market more regularly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1319430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Kunduz is 29 years old and is raising four children.  In search of income for her family, 10 years ago Kunduz started her business raising and reselling livestock, starting with the purchase of one milk cow.  Kunduz sells milk and dairy products such as ayran (a yogurt beverage), sour cream and farmer's cheese at the local market.  Today, her holdings include 40 cows, 2 horses and 30 sheep.  This business allows Kunduz to earn around 15,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further grow her business, Kunduz turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of livestock.  Kunduz plans to invest her earning into further increasing her livestock count.  In the future she hopes to provide her children with a quality education.

old, she is married and has 4 children.  Gulnara raises livestock as the main source of income.  Having started this business with 4,000 som (KGS) after the breakup of the USSR, thanks to her hard work, Gulnara was able to expand her holdings to a monthly profit of 12,000 som (KGS).  Today her holdings include 10 horses and 40 sheep.  Thanks to profits from her holdings, Gulnara pays for her family's needs.  Gulnara sells milk and dairy products out of her home.  In order to further grow her business, Gulnara turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of more sheep.  This will allow her to increase her income from reselling livestock.  Gulnara plans to invest the profits from the loan into further growing her business and in the future would like to buy a refrigerator for her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1319114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more sheep for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Jilga village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-24T18:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-23T18:30:05Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50294.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013998},{"amount":1016.29,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50294.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.71,"payment_id":467830763}],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T10:11:28Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T10:23:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sabina Holzman","image":36162}},{"id":540798,"name":"Temotea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Temotea is a 61-year-old married woman and a mother of seven children.

They also have a milk cow which is milked to make cheese. Harvested products and the cheese are sold locally at the markets and family gets a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nRamin requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Ramin will open a caf\u00e9.

Kenya, which houses a campus of Mt.

Her primary income sources are selling milk and eggs.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Feeding cow!' Her biggest challenge is 'Digging.' The animal in the farm is named \"Chebois\". She will use the loan to buy poultry birds.\r\n\r\nEmily was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Grace period issue and low interest rate.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'It has low interest rate.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Emily replied 'It will get more income to meet family needs.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Emily owns the following: 'cow, poultry, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, solar power' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Junes replied 'I will be in a position to pay school fees for my children.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Junes owns the following: 'cow, poultry, automobile' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

The loan will be used to start purchasing other items to sell, and will help Charity to generate greater profits and enlarge the business. Charity hopes that in the future she will be able to start another business. \r\n\r\nCharity is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She began her business because she needed a source of income to support herself. She works at the business eight hours a day and six days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the poor road network within her area of operation.\r\n\r\nMariama requires a loan in order to buy local foodstuffs like gari and palm oil. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to have a permanent business location and improve her family's welfare. In the future, Mariama plans to open a palm oil store.

To start, she requested her first loan to buy a kitchen and three sets of utensils. She has a year of experience and it has gone well for her. Her life companion provides her with the fish, and she is in charge of preparing and selling it. This year she learned to make cocktails and ceviches. She comments that this year in the business, it has gone well for her.  \r\n\r\nShe also sells chicken and grilled beef, so she travels to the city that is approximately 25 kilometers away, two times per week, to buy the ingredients to prepare the food. For the seafood, she buys about 30 pounds of shrimp and 8 pounds of fish.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from Fundacion Campo is to buy more seafood and the ingredients for the chicken and grilled beef. She will buy beverages and three more sets of utensils. She needs to make the investment, given that Holy Week is getting close in the country, and this time of year is really good for her.

She is an energetic lady of 23 years who lives with her husband and only son, three years old \r\n\r\nSasmita is has been running a silver jewelry shop in her house for the last two years. Her husband is running a utensils-selling business by moving to nearby villages and weekly markets via a moped. Previously, he was running a utensils shop in a cabin but due to lack of capital, he could not continue the same successfully. So Sasmita formed this group and took a loan of 14,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation to invest in her business. She added another 36,000 INR from their savings and with a capital of 50,000 INR, gave a new look to the present business. They started two businesses. One is silver jewelry selling at the home for her and the other is the utensils business for her husband for mobile vending. As Sasmita had experience managing a similar type of business from her parental house, she is successfully managing her jewelery shop. Sasmita\u2019s family earns a daily net income of 500 INR from the existing two businesses. Out of this income, she has been able to manage her household expenses in a decent manner. Sasmita buys the jewelry as well as the utensils from the local wholeseller twice a month. With the present loan, Sasmita wants to increase the stock of utensils by purchasing in bulk. This will help her to reduce the purchasing cost as she replenishes her stock frequently. Sasmita hopes to save enough money to provide better education to her only child and build a house for her own.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Anusaya, Tikina, Ramakumari and Gori who are successfully running small enterprises.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1318549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase more utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-03-25T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-24T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anusaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gori","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tikina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramakumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasmita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T18:42:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":541105,"name":"Maha Laxmi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muniguda is a small town where Radhamani, a widow age 51, is residing with her son of 31 years and a daughter of 21 years of age. Muniguda is situated in the Rayagada district of northern Odisha, India. The government has declared Rayagada as a backward district in Odisha state. Tribal people are the primitive community of this area. They depend on agro-forestry products. So some people have migrated from the coastal belt to this area to earn their livelihood by adopting some business. The family of Radhamani, the featured member standing on the extreme left with her hand raised, also migrated from another district to Muniguda and started a general grocery shop. Seven years ago, her husband, Trinath, died due to illness. She could not give him the appropriate treatment due to her poor income. After her husband\u2019s death, she started making leaf plates and sold them in the market. Her son runs his father\u2019s shop but their income is not sufficient to manage their family. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Radhamani formed a Joint liability group in the year 2010 with five women in her locality, named Maha Laxmi to get a business loan from Mahashakti Foundation. In the first loan, she got 12,000 rupees and as she has experience stitching from her parent\u2019s house, she purchased a sewing machine. She started stitching ladies and gents dresses. In the second loan, she got an 18000\/- loan from Mahashakti and purchased a Pico machine to help her in tailoring work. Her income gradually increased . In the meantime, her son married. This is the third loan for Radhamani and with this loan she is planning to purchase some new cloth to sell and stitch. Now she is very happy. She is maintaining a peaceful and pleasant life with her son, daughter and daughter in law. She has a dream of marrying her daughter to a good businessman. She is improving her business to realize her cherished dream. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Rina, Sasmita, Subasini, and Sushama.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1318571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase clothes to sell and stitch","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-03-25T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-24T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Radhamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T02:30:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":541111,"name":"Champeswar Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Champeswar is a Joint Liability Group formed in the year 2009 by five active women entrepreneurs of Bhawanipatna town in Kalahandi district of Odisha, India to request a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing businesses.

Choum is a farmer who manages two hectares of rainy season rice-growing and a three hectare area of dry season rice cropping.

She is married and has four children aged 17, 14, 10 and 7. She has two additional dependents, who live with her for schooling.  In 2001, Bintu established her clothing and textile business. She began her business just to generate enough funds to support her children\u2019s education. Her business is located in the city center and her main customers are both men and women. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about SLL 540,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan of SLL 6,000,000.
