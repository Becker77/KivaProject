district, i.e. Bhawanipatna, of Odisha, India. The lady standing second from left in the sky color sari with raised hand is Rebati.  She lives with her husband and two sons, age 29 and 20. She is very energetic, hardworking and enthusiastic and she always devotes her efforts to get her family ahead. \r\n \r\nFor 20 years, Rebati has been running a general shop. Initially, she started the business in a low profile with limited items like potato, soap, sugar, tea dust, tobacco, chocolates, etc. Gradually, she expanded her business and added extra items regularly. Now her son is looking after the business. \r\n\r\nIn the year 2009, Rebati, along with three other women of her locality, formed a Joint Liability Group named Mahalaxmi-1 and took a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their business. All members hail from poor backgrounds in the Below Poverty Line category. This is the third loan of her group. \r\n\r\nDuring the last three loans, Rebati has been able to add some grocery items like dough, oil, spices, etc. Now she is earning 500 INR daily from her business. Rebati wants to keep more stock for her shop, but due to financial scarcity, her son has to go to the nearest market to buy items for her grocery shop regularly. Due to frequent purchases, she incurs losses due to transportation costs.

She lives with her husband, two daughters and one son.\r\n\r\nSanjukta is running a bricks-selling business with the help of her husband. She herself runs her own brick kiln and sometimes purchases bricks from other vendors and supplies them to contractors and house builders. Her monthly net income from the bricks business comes to 10,000 INR.

His parents also live with him in Ditsi village, Gori district. The family has a milk cow which is milked to make cheese which is sold locally at the markets.  They also own a plot of land where they grow haricot, maize, and tomatoes. The harvested products are sold among their villagers and they receive a small monthly income. \n\nRamaz requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were always rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Ramaz is requesting a loan from Credo to start a family business. The Kiva\/Credo start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-ups and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \n\nRamaz will use the loan to purchase liquid gas to fill up his gas containers which will be installed in his car. In their village, there is no gas installed in the houses, so he will fill up the big containers and help his villagers to charge their small gas balloons, which is used mainly for cooking. Ramaz is very experienced in this field as he had this business before and still has the containers, which will economize his expenses and grow the profit. Part of the profit will be reinvested in the same business and another part used to cultivate more land and plant more vegetables. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She's married and has five children.  Two are school-aged.  Her spouse works building and repairing homes and only works seasonally. Odina herself worked for many years on a dairy farm.  During the recent, worldwide crisis, her wages were at first withheld, and then she was laid off all together.  She was one of the farm's best workers, sometimes milking up to one hundred liters.  It was difficult for her to part with her cow, she had bonded with them.  It was, however, inevitable.  \n\nShe has quite a bit of experience with livestock. After she was laid off, she began breeding cows on her land.  At first it was difficult, but with time, it became easier.  Her older children help her with the work.  Her neighbor told her about Arvand and she came in for a loan.  With the funds, she will buy livestock.  She is very grateful to Arvand for the support and she plans on further collaboration.

She is a member of the Lomgoul Group. After her husband passed away, she moved back to her poor parents' home with her kids. Tragedy struck when her younger daughter was found drowned in the nearby pond, which shook Henei\u2019s life and became the reason to continue to live her life. Starting a new life without her husband and her deceased daughter wasn\u2019t easy at all, but her son would be an orphan if Henei lost hope and cursed herself for the plight she faces. Her son is the only reason why she is back in form to continue her life and start off the business to support her son and herself. Her group members also supported and encouraged her in all possible ways.\r\n\r\n Henei started her own business by selling cosmetic and grocery products.  She used to get the stock from the nearby Army canteen and sold it with a profit in the village and nearby markets. Her supplies consist of talcum powders, hair oils, detergent soaps, tooth-paste, milk powder, detergent powder, etc. With the little profit she made, she also started selling used clothes in her village and neighbouring villages. She gets the used clothes from the main town, which is about 30 kms from the village where she resides. \r\n\r\n With the extension of the loan from Kiva, Henei decided to get more used clothes from the main market consisting of  T-shirts, Medi-Pants, summer pants, shorts, and cotton shirts as she feels that summer is approaching and selling these items will bring more money. She will sell used clothes as well as continue stocking army canteen supplies for the villagers and the nearby shops.\r\n\r\nHenei's dream is to own a house of her own that she and her son can share without feeling any obligations towards anyone. Her community has shown her more support than she feels she and her son deserve. Thus, she is hopeful that with the loan, she will formulate a way to earn her monthly income and do some saving to let her dreams come true.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1318364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more used clothes for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-03-25T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-24T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hesen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatngah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoichingkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneihat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahtin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T02:56:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":541431,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilson is a 38-year-old man with four children living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Now, she is seeking 1,200,000 KHR while her co-borrower is applying for half of her requesting loan amount, 600,000 KHR only.

She's married and the mother of five children, who make a living growing coffee together as a family.  She didn't finish primary school, though she went through fifth grade with a lot of effort and sacrifice.  She lacked the financial help to continue because her parents had a low income level and had to use their cash input to buy food to support the family.\r\n\r\nIt was her parents who taught her how to grow coffee more than 30 years ago, which she continues doing up to the present.  It's the only income and means of support for her family.  Her husband acquired the land they cultivate from a family inheritance, and it has been fruitful for them.  The land is located 100 meters away, and they go there every day to maintain and weed it, which allows them to keep their crop free of weeds.  They sell their crop through various intermediaries who come to the community to acquire it.\r\n\r\nCurrently she's requesting help to buy fertilizer and manure for her coffee crop so she can keep it free of pests and diseases that destroy entire crops if not treated in time.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her crop to generate more income so she can continue investing in coffee production.  One of her greatest challenges is the constant increase and rise in prices of the very supplies that are a big help in guaranteeing a 100% crop.  This will allow her to give her children a better education and improve their standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1320930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and manure for her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-03-25T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-24T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":26000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5.1,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042109},{"amount":1319.9,"local_amount":25900,"processed_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25983.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082516}],"funded_date":"2013-03-26T00:10:14Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:09:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":541446,"name":"Sreyoun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A local farmer on five hectares of farmland from Battambang province, Sreyoun is married and 29 years old.

The couple have 1 daughter, Lily, who is 30 years old.  They live together in their own home together with their two grandchildren who they love very much.  Tezalia's business is providing a passenger transport service with a motorcycle taxi that she bought with her savings.  When she first started out in this business she hired a motorcycle taxi.  She saw that its condition was deteriorating rapidly owing to the hard conditions that it was being put through and decided that her husband could drive it in order to provide a service.  Four years ago, Tezalia bought her first vehicle and, over the years, she has also refurbished other vehicles as they deteriorate rapidly owing to the daily stresses that they are put through.\r\n\r\nTezalia enjoys her business as it makes her income with which she is able to cover her family's expenses.  She started working in her business because she needed an income and was unable to find a stable job.  She now feels more secure.  She doesn't like it when her motorcycle taxis experience problems very quickly as it creates unforeseen expenses.  However, she is still able to make good profits.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Tezalia is requesting a loan for 1,000 soles.

Santo Domingo is the third most populous city in the region and also has agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing and manufacturing since it\u2019s become a place for commercial interchange between the country\u2019s mountain and coast regions.\n\nMar\u00eda leads the \u201cGrandes Comerciantes\u201d (Great Merchants) group, a group of four persons who joined together seeking the same goal: to find support to improve and grow in businesses they started some years ago to improve their and their families\u2019 quality of life.\n\nMar\u00eda sells fruit and vegetables in a small space set aside at home.  She started this activity ten years ago because she needed to contribute towards household expenses.  She now must cover her needs and all household expenses like utilities, occasional repairs, etc. by herself.  This enterprising woman needs a loan to buy a larger variety of fruit and vegetables to increase income to help her have a better quality of life.\n\nHer enterprising friends like her, Karen, Jaime and Carmen, carry out a variety of activities.  Karen, 19, is single and has a son attending school.  She sells cosmetics from place to place and needs to buy products that are on special sale to get better prices.  Jaime, like Mar\u00eda, sells fruit and vegetables and wants to buy seasonal fruit to increase sales.  Carmen has two children.  She sells shoes and casual clothes.  She will invest in a wider variety of products.\n\nThese people have faced business growth obstacles due to lack of capital and credit opportunities.  In order to reach their objective now, they called on a branch office Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has in Santo Domingo where they were met with trust and flexibility.  The members of this group have hard work and effort they do daily in common and none of them have ever given up because the personal and family motivation the group has in common is hard, dedicated work they do every day to reach their dreams.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1316656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

He has taken several courses at the university and his greatest dream is to finish his studies in order to become a professional and contribute to his country\u2019s development.\r\n\r\nFredy lives with his brother, Mario, in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, in a barrio called \u201cChillogallo,\u201d which is located in the southern part of the city. Until recently the neighborhood was ignored as an area of strong economic growth in the capital. Now, however, this area is considered a strong center of economic growth. Here, hardworking families have struggled to succeed. The area\u2019s inhabitants include both native-born and migrants from other cities and countries. It has been a meeting point for people from various provinces and it is being re-built with broad streets. It is an area with a high level of commercial activity and it is constantly growing and contributing to the economic growth of the city. Parks form spacious green zones where families get together on weekends. The people here have access to all kinds of services and they are entrepreneurs who take advantage of every opportunity to establish new businesses.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Fredy opened a store selling basic necessities in the area. He learned the business from some relatives and devotes at least six hours a day to it. Through his efforts, this business has been growing. Nevertheless he has often encountered difficulty in obtaining funding to expand his store. He needs a loan so that he can purchase products to stock his store and sell to his customers.

Previously she was a housewife but when she separated from the father of her children she was left without any income and she needed to help her children get ahead with the little that she had learnt how to do, which was cooking. She regrets not having studied; therefore, she does not want this destiny for her children and she fights to help them get ahead each day with the resources that she has.\r\n\r\nCurrently, besides selling fried plantains and enchiladas, she sells potatoes stuffed with cheese, and repochetas [fried tortillas with beans, cheese, cabbage salad, onion, sour cream, ketchup, and vinegar]. The more variety she offers, the more her customers can try of her cooking. She has decided to establish a small fried food stand in schools due to the large number of both students and teachers. This will allow her to sell more and obtain greater revenue. In the future she would like to expand the business into a food kiosk in other schools.\r\n\r\nEgda wants to give her children a better quality of life.

He is pictured with 24 One Acre Fund farmers, 12 women and 12 men. Douglas is standing on the right with his hand raised. He is receiving an input loan for \u00bd acre of sweet potato, millet, and sorghum cultivation. Douglas first enrolled with the One Acre Fund during the 2011 Long Rains and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. Douglas joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nDouglas described his harvest as excellent last year as a One Acre Fund farmer and hopes for another good year in the 2013 Long Rains season.

She lives in Etseri village, Terjola district with her husband Gaga, and is mother to an infant, Tamar. Marekhi requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main income for the family is from agricultural activities. They have a milk cow, a plot of agricultural land and a vineyard. The cow is milked to make dairy products. On the land they grow wheat, and the harvested product are sold locally at the markets along with the dairy products. In addition, Gaga is working on construction projects for private orders as an artisan and gets small monthly income.  \r\n\r\nMarekhi requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Marekhi will start trading in fruits and vegetables. She will purchase from the market in Terjola at the wholesale price, bring it to her village and sell it with a retail price mark-up. Marekhi is experienced in agriculture and she hopes her business will be profitable. She will use the profit to reinvest in the same business. This will grow monthly income and enable Marekhi to provide better living conditions for the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1319203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To purchase fruits and vegetables at the wholesale price and resell it with a retail price markup","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Etseri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-26T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-25T04:50:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marekhi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":48.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":49.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":52.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":54.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.47},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.47,"local_amount":30.42,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":30.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969058},{"amount":23.82,"local_amount":39.23,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":39.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749477},{"amount":24.87,"local_amount":40.97,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":41.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613385},{"amount":25.24,"local_amount":41.57,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":41.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857104},{"amount":25.97,"local_amount":42.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":43.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133760},{"amount":27.03,"local_amount":44.51,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":44.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107350},{"amount":27.53,"local_amount":45.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":45.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254913},{"amount":28.56,"local_amount":47.05,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":47.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019072},{"amount":223.51,"local_amount":368.13,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":370.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670224}],"funded_date":"2013-03-26T10:48:51Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:07:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":541522,"name":"Lamarana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 35-year-old Lamarana from Sierra Leone.

She is single with six children and three of them attend school. She also looks after her sister. She has been selling small yellow bananas in the market for fifteen years, working six days a week. She also sells water as another source of income. \r\nShe has requested a loan of UGX 800,000 from MCDT-SACCO to enable her to buy more green bananas for sale.

This is 39-year-old Daisy from Mutare. She is married with four children, two of whom are attending school.  Daisy runs a retail business selling radios, TVs, solar panels and batteries locally in Mutare. The business has been in operation for four years.

One of the main challenges she faces is the great competition in the area where she sells her stock.  The extra income from the loan will help her pay for her children\u2019s school fees.

She is married with six children and all of them attend school. She is also looking after her sister.\r\nShe has been selling raw food in the market for two years, working six days a week. She also sells cow peas to earn additional income.\r\nShe has requested a loan of UGX 200,000 from MCDT-SACCO to enable her to purchase more foodstuff like bananas, cassava, sweet and Irish potatoes to sell.

Roset is 23 years old and lives in the town of Hima in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is married and has two children. For the past two years, Roset has been working hard to manage her clinic, which sells tablets. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Roset has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase and stock more drugs to sell, and will help Roset to generate greater profits and pay rent for the clinic. Roset hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nRoset is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Adem\u00e1s la visita de turistas nacionales y extranjeros aporta al fortalecimiento de las actividades de los emprendedores que desde hace algunos a\u00f1os han establecido sus negocios alrededor de toda la ciudad. Esta ciudad que es la tercera m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nMirian trabaja comercializando ropa desde hace 3 a\u00f1os ella ofrece sus prendas a sus amigos y conocidos que luego le recomiendan con personas nuevas y  as\u00ed seguir creciendo. Ella dedica al menos 5 horas en esta actividad que aprendi\u00f3 gracias al apoyo y recomendaciones de algunos amigos. Mirian ha asistido a las capacitaciones que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa brinda a sus clientes microempresarios en donde ha aprendido sobre como crecer y administrar su negocio. Por esta y otras razones Mirian lleva trabajando con esta IMF desde que inici\u00f3 su negocio y ahora solicita un nuevo cr\u00e9dito para realizar algunos arreglos en un departamento ubicado en el interior de su casa, y de esta forma aprovechar este espacio arrend\u00e1ndolo y sumar un valor extra a sus ingresos mensuales, mejorando as\u00ed su estilo de vida y el de su familia. Esta mujer emprendedora sue\u00f1a en el futuro tener su propio taller de costura para confeccionar y vender ropa y adem\u00e1s ofrecer un hogar estable a sus hijos.","en":"Mirian is thirty-years-old and married to Manuel, forty-three, who works both as a driver and in construction.  They have two children, including an eight-year-old, who is in school, and a three-year-old.  Mirian hopes to see the children become high-quality professionals because she herself grew up in a home with few financial resources where her family could afford to educate her only through high school.  She lives with her family in Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n Parish in Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas Province, an area that's commercially very active because it has become a land port of exchange between the mountains and the coast of Ecuador.   In addition, domestic and foreign tourists support the strengthening of businesses owned by entrepreneurs that have set up shop all over the city in the past few years.  The city is the third most populous in the region and also contributes with industries like agriculture, livestock, fishing, and manufacturing.  \r\n\r\nMirian has been selling clothing for three years.  She offers her wares to her friends and acquaintances who then recommend her to others, so she keeps on growing.  She works at least five hours a day in the business that she learned thanks to the support and recommendations of some friends.  She has attended training provided by Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to its microfinance clients, where she learned how to run her business.  For this and other reasons, Mirian has been working with IMF since she started her business and now she is seeking a new loan to do some repairs to an apartment in her house.  She wants to take advantage of the space by renting it out to augment her monthly income so she can improve her and her family's lifestyle.  This enterprising woman dreams of having her own sewing workshop in the future where she can make and sell clothing, and of providing a stable home to her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1319650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to do repairs on an apartment in her house so she can rent it out.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-26T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-25T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirian Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1336.66,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":202.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":217.85},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":231.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.03},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":204.82,"local_amount":202.8,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":204.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133246},{"amount":220.03,"local_amount":217.85,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":220.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313785},{"amount":224.95,"local_amount":222.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":224.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565390},{"amount":462.12,"local_amount":457.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":462.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814429},{"amount":236.11,"local_amount":233.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":236.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320601},{"amount":1.97,"local_amount":1.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856291}],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T11:11:27Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":542514,"name":"Eva Elvira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eva Elvira es una mujer de sesenta y seis a\u00f1os de edad, soltera y madre de dos hijos, originaria de un municipio ubicado al sureste del departamento de Chinandega, es una micro-empresaria se dedica a la venta de cajetas,  dulces t\u00edpicos elaborado a base de leche az\u00facar, coco y especies las distribuye de forma ambulante.

She is single and has one child. For the past three years, Phiona has been working hard to manage her boutique, which sells clothes. To help expand her business, Phiona has applied for a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes to increase her stock, and it will help Phiona to generate greater profits and increase the income level of her family. Phiona hopes that, in the future, she will be able to live a good life. Phiona is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

He is pictured with twelve One Acre Fund farmers: eight women and four men. Zephaniah is standing on the right with his hand raised. Zephaniah joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. He is receiving an input loan for half an acre of sweet potato, millet, and sorghum cultivation. Zephaniah joined One Acre Fund so that he could access the best input prices and grow enough food for his family.\r\n\r\nZephaniah described his harvest as very good last year, but he believes he can have an even better one this year.

She began her business because she needed a permanent income to support the home. She works at the business 9 hours per day and 6 days per week. When there is a crisis of fuel, it leads to her goods being delayed.\r\n\r\nDuba requires a loan in order to buy more local food, like palm oil.

When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?,' Anthony replied: 'In paying for my children.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi Kilimo's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Anthony owns the following: 'cow, poultry,' but he does not own: 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards, based on this loan. This borrower has in the household: 'mosquito net,' but does not have: 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD.'\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used

She works with the help of her husband and some laborers she hires, depending on how much work there is to do.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her job is the profit she gets from her sales, because this product is highly valued and requested by the community.  Also, by selling it along with other products her earnings are always good.  She plans to get a sales stall in some market in the city where she can sell retail and earn even more.\r\n\r\nCurrently she's going to request 500 soles [PEN] to rent a sales stall in the main market of her town so she can continue selling a variety of regional products, primarily bananas.\r\n\r\nShe's happy to know she has financial support that will let her get ahead with her business and continue to grow personally.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1321246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to rent a sales stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-26T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-25T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":73.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":79.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":82.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.47},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":89.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.5,"local_amount":73.76,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":76.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578052},{"amount":31.97,"local_amount":79.91,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:37Z","rounded_local_amount":82.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530280},{"amount":33.15,"local_amount":82.88,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":85.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975309},{"amount":33.39,"local_amount":83.47,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":86.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996577},{"amount":35.63,"local_amount":89.09,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":92.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864058},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":90.89,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":94.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352400}],"funded_date":"2013-03-26T20:55:23Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":541789,"name":"Bernard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 43-year-old Bernard.

Their products are marketed through intermediaries who come to the zone which has a good reputation for quality, cleanliness and their way of working; but as with all cultivations, there is always the risk of plagues and variation in market prices.\n\nCurrently Maria Octaviana is requesting help so she can invest in her fields of potatoes, broccoli and cauliflower by buying fertilizer, manure and fumigation sprays to help maintain her products so they are healthy and free of plagues. \n\nHer dream is to be able to improve her home, to buy a piece of land so she can work and cultivate more vegetables; but her priority is to see her children become professionals with a better education and a brighter future for themselves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1321138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizers, manure and fumigation sprays for her fields of potatoes, broccoli and cauliflower","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"azacualpa, yamaranguila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-03-26T21:20:34Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-25T21:20:34Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Octaviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.74,"local_amount":347.92,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":349.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373118863},{"amount":23.7,"local_amount":464.66,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":466.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399793687},{"amount":1233.56,"local_amount":24187.42,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":24283.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812996}],"funded_date":"2013-03-27T09:12:09Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:29:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carrie N.","image":1077468}},{"id":541802,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is a father of two children aged six and four years and has been in active farming in his rural home for twenty years where he produces mainly maize and beans for the local market.
