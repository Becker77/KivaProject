With everything she obtained, she went through the streets of the city, offering her products and hoping to sell a considerable quantity that would allow her to have good earnings. Her work is on foot, and she does it with the help of her husband. She has been doing this for about four years. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she can go through the streets of the city together with her husband, working and strolling at the same time. She knows new people, and she strikes up new relationships that later become regular customers. She is very happy because thanks to this work she has improved the family economy. She hopes to soon have a regular sales stall in some market or in her house, so that she can sell a greater quantity and variety of articles. At this time she is applying for 1000 PEN, and she feels grateful for the opportunity to have financial support, which allows her to advance with her business. With the loan that she has applied for, she will buy items for women such as hairpins, bracelets, decorations, and other items so that she can continue working.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1321261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy hairpins, bracelets, decorations, and other products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-27T01:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-26T01:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":159.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":178.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":182.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.96,"local_amount":147.39,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":152.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578053},{"amount":63.86,"local_amount":159.66,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":165.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530281},{"amount":66.25,"local_amount":165.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":171.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975310},{"amount":66.71,"local_amount":166.79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996578},{"amount":71.21,"local_amount":178.02,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":184.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864059},{"amount":73.01,"local_amount":182.52,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":189.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352401}],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T01:58:11Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":542601,"name":"Maria Suyapa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera, tiene 3 hijos y vive en una aldea del municipio de Arizona, Atl\u00e1ntida.

En el Banco Comunal de Las Exitosas hay diversos rubros entre los cuales encontramos venta de ropa nueva y usada, torner\u00eda mec\u00e1nica, perfumes, joyas, panader\u00eda, cremas y maquillaje. La se\u00f1ora Ximena vende ropa, accesorios como cigarreras, adem\u00e1s de cremas reductoras y para el pelo. Hace tres a\u00f1os renuncio a su trabajo y fue el impulso para que  trabajara de manera independiente, en ese tiempo se dedico a vender joyas, maquillaje, masajes reductores, cremas reductoras,  y empez\u00f3 con un capital de solo $20.000, aunque tuvo una buena llegada los problemas fueron apareciendo en el momento de que las clientas le pagaran porque muchas personas le compraban pero no le pagaban de inmediato y al momento en que Ximena les iba a cobrar, ellas ya no trabajaban en ese lugar o simplemente se hab\u00edan cambiado de casa, ese fue un gran problema al principio cuando estaba empezando con su peque\u00f1o negocio, pero eso de todas maneras le ayudo para aprender y as\u00ed fortalecer de a poco su negocio; adem\u00e1s de no tener competencia en su rubro, por lo cual es un negocio seguro ya que, por el tiempo que lleva trabajando, ha podido hacerse de clientas . Ximena nos cuenta que el pr\u00e9stamo lo ocupar\u00e1 para comprar ropa y as\u00ed poder ampliar aun mas su rubro, que tiene que ver con ayudar a que la mujeres se sientan aun m\u00e1s bonitas. Ella espera y tiene todas las ganas de que al momento de recibir su cr\u00e9dito, \u00e9ste le ayude para que sea un buen a\u00f1o y exitoso, adem\u00e1s de estar completamente agradecida con Fondo Esperanza por no solo entregarle ayuda econ\u00f3mica, sino tambi\u00e9n por ser una ayuda integral en donde adem\u00e1s las capacitan y siempre est\u00e1n pendientes de la ayuda que necesiten para poder cumplir sus sue\u00f1os.     ","en":"\"Las Exitosas\" is a communal bank located in the city of Concepci\u00f3n. It is here that we meet Ximena, who, in the photo, is standing on the right, with long, straight dark hair.  In this communal bank there are various types of business, including selling new and used clothing, a machine shop, and members selling perfumes, jewellery, bread, creams and make-up.  Ximena sells clothes and accessories (such as cigar cases) as well as muscle-relaxing creams and hair products.  Ximena quit her job three years ago and was motivated to start working independently.  At the time she made a living selling jewellery, make-up, massages and creams for pain relief.  She started with $20,000 of capital though she had many problems with payments as, while customers were buying her products, they did not pay immediately and when Ximena later went to collect the payments people had changed address.  This was a big problem in the beginning when she was starting out but it still helped her to learn and to strengthen her business little by little.  She also has no competition for her business so it is quite secure and since she has started working she has been able to  attract clients.  Ximena tells us that she will use this loan to buy clothes, thus expanding her business mission which is to do with helping women to feel even more beautiful.  Ximena hopes and really wants that the loan will help her to have a good and successful year.  She is very grateful to \"Fondo Esperanza\" for not just providing financial resources but also for being an important help in providing training.  \"Fondo Esperanza\" is always on the lookout to see how they can help people fulfill their dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4325,"image":{"id":1321874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She lives with Eliazar, her husband of 20 years, and the couple have two children: Kelvin and Lizbeth.  They care for their children in a house that they inherited 12 years ago.\r\n\r\nWhile Aquilina's husband works as a laborer in a brick factory, where they pay him for every 1,000 bricks he makes, Aquilina's business is buying and selling livestock.  This is where they make the most profit.  Aquilina buys sheep, bulls and cows when they are very young, raises and feeds them, then sells them in the local markets in the city.  She has a lot of experience in this line of work.  She says that she charges a very good price for her animals and, if people don't pay her what she asks, she takes the animals home again, continues feeding them, and puts them up for sale again later so that she can make a good profit.  \"I can't sell my animals for too little.  I have to be smart\", she says.

She herself has retired from work and gets a monthly state pension. The house they live in has been deteriorating over the years, and the roof, particularly, needs some serious repair. So she is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials, such as fiberglass, bricks, plates, and planks. After repairing the roof and other parts of the house, the family will be able to burn less coal, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution by emitting less smoke.

She became a widow eight years ago and has six children.  She currently lives with her son Antony and her granddaughter Adriana who she cares for in the house that she bought 38 years ago.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, Marcelina set up a business raising pigs.  She has 10 animals which are all healthy and a good breed.  \"I raise them in the open fields.  I can't raise them at home because they are too large.  Anyway, they grow healthier and stronger that way\", she says.  When Marcelina's animals have grown, she sells them either alive or as meat: \"It all depends on the customer\", she says.  Marcelina would like to create a better space for her animals and so she is planning to improve her barn.  She would like to fatten a number of animals as she already has orders for Mothers' Day.\r\n\r\nThis is Marcelina's first loan from Kiva.  She is grateful for the financial support as it will enable her to achieve her goals.  For her part, she pledges to make her loan repayments on time.  Marcelina will invest the 1,000 soles she has requested in buying nutritionally-balanced feed for her pigs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1322007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy nutritionally-balanced pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-27T15:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-26T15:40:16Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":107.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":115.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":118.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":123.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":127.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":131.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":136.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":139.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.09,"local_amount":107.72,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":111.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578065},{"amount":46.05,"local_amount":115.12,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":119.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530293},{"amount":47.29,"local_amount":118.24,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":122.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975321},{"amount":49.34,"local_amount":123.35,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":127.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996590},{"amount":50.83,"local_amount":127.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":131.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864071},{"amount":52.68,"local_amount":131.71,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":136.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352413},{"amount":54.74,"local_amount":136.84,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":141.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904280},{"amount":55.98,"local_amount":139.95,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":144.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090371}],"funded_date":"2013-03-27T20:44:18Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":542963,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nancy, de 54 a\u00f1os de edad ,vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo y su hijo Eduardo en la casa que compraron hace 10 a\u00f1os.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs.

At these meetings she also draws strength and inspiration from studying the word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Khujaqul and his wife work in the \"dekhkan\" farming sector, which is an agricultural system unique to Tajikistan whereby small individual or collective private farms are set up to be worked by a few people, and where the main crops grown are cotton, wheat, or vegetables, accounting for 60% of irrigated land use in the country. Now Khujaqul wants to start his own business in the area of animal husbandry because this field is profitable and does not require a great deal of physical labour.

She is married to a brick layer with an uncertain income. In order to supplement her husband's income, she produces various kinds of cake and fried snacks. Every morning, she starts making cakes at 1 AM until midday. She then sells her products in the nearby market. She is skillful in producing various kinds of traditional cakes. Tanisem will use this loan to buy ingredients (eggs, flour, butter, sugar) for her cakes and fried snacks. The additional income from the business will be spent on her children's school fees and also to pay their rent. She already has her own customers so competition is not a challenge for her; however, the seasonal floods are. Since she lives in a densely populated area near the river bank, floods might come 3-4 times a year.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to be able to send her son to the maritime

The village is located in the southernmost part of Toledo district in the country of Belize, with no access to electricity and alongside an under way highway to Guatemala. The couple has raised nine children, six of whom currently live in. \n\nThomas started his cacao farming with the assistance of a local association. He manages a farm with 400 productive cacao trees, and 300 newly planted seedlings \u2013 cacao trees raised in a bag before transplanting. Besides cacao, the family cultivates the traditional Maya package of corn, beans and rice for home use and extra income. Cacao is his favorite crop, says Thomas, because it is both a cash crop and a staple at home. Most Mayan families use some of their cacao for making cacao drink \u2013 stone ground beans that are mixed with water and used as an alternative to coffee. \n\nThe family puts a lot of focus on their children\u2019s education. Four of the kids are currently enrolled in either primary or secondary school. Farming alone hasn\u2019t been sufficient to pay school fees, so Thomas has been doing jobs in construction and security to offset the cost. In the future, Thomas hopes to expand his farm to grow it for the future generations in the family. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to hire help with cleaning the 300 newly planted trees. Cleaning plays an important role in the cacao industry, as \u201cif you don\u2019t clean, you can\u2019t get nothing from that tree. If it\u2019s not clean, it won\u2019t bear, \u201c Thomas told Maya Mountain Cacao in perfect English, his second language after Maya Mopan. Newly planted seedlings need space and sunlight to grow and prosper, and therefore require extra diligent care. The job at hand will require and create 12 days worth of work in the community. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1321242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To clean around newly planted cacao trees.

He started the business when he observed that his neighbors were travelling long distances to buy this beverage on the weekends and during festivals.\r\n\r\nCurrently he has a shop where he sells beer, soft drinks, cakes and packaged foods.  He works daily from three in the afternoon until two in the morning.  His goal is to keep growing his business, but obtaining initial working capital is his biggest challenge.\r\n\r\nFor this reason he is seeking his first loan through Kiva from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the funds to buy beer by the case.  The season is approaching when there are fewer work days, and during this time, the consumption of this beverage increases, so his investment should be successful.\r\n\r\nFurther down the road he hopes to have sufficient resources to buy more chairs, offering a more attractive and comfortable environment to his customers. He hopes to be able to save money after covering his family's expenses and providing for their well-being.

The group, pictured above, is comprised of 10 One Acre Fund farmers, 6 women and 4 men. Hellen is standing on the right, with her hand raised. She is receiving an input loan for \u00bd acre of sweet potato, millet, and sorghum cultivation. Hellen joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. Hellen joined One Acre Fund so that she could access the best input prices and grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nHellen described her harvest as good last year, but she believes she can have an even better one this year.

He is married and lives with his wife and two children (9 and 11 years old). Soso requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success.  His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. Soso\u2019s wife milks the cow and produces cheese for selling. They also have three pigs. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \r\n\r\nSoso requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of a business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor.  These people do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d  because of low income. Soso plans to start his own business.\r\nThe place in which he lives is very conducive to opening a fast food stall, where he will sell Doner (similar to kabobs). With the received credit, Soso will purchase the stock of raw materials to make doner and a refrigerator for juices. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1320691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to open a fast food stall and sell Doner","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Mukhrani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-28T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-27T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":830}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":834},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":830}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":834,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":834,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107354},{"amount":834,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":834,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254917},{"amount":834,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":834,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019076},{"amount":834,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":834,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670228},{"amount":834,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":834,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459140886},{"amount":830,"local_amount":830,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467956660}],"funded_date":"2013-04-16T04:27:02Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:16:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":542225,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel is a 24 year-old married man.

Tuvieron un hijo quien ahora es independiente. Lucinda vive en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, un lugar hist\u00f3rico de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nLucinda desde hace 3 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con el establecimiento de una papeler\u00eda para apoyar a su esposo en los gastos del hogar, lo atiende paralelamente con los quehaceres de su hogar, pues este local est\u00e1 ubicado en el mismo lugar de su domicilio. Lucinda busca ofrecer variedad de productos y satisfacer a los clientes de todas las edades, es por esto que tambi\u00e9n ofrece algunos v\u00edveres y golosinas para que sus ventas se incrementen. Ella invierte varias horas al d\u00eda en la atenci\u00f3n de su negocio y su crecimiento ha sido estancado debido a la falta de apoyo para el financiamiento.

","en":"Lucinda is a 59 year-old woman. She has attended secondary school but did not have the opportunity to continue her studies at the university as she has worked since she was very young and she married Jos\u00e9, who is 67 years old and works as a driver. They have one child who lives on his own. Lucinda lives in the Rio Verde area, which is a historic area of Santo Domingo, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo of the \u201cTsachilas\u201d, a province in Ecuador. In the last few years this area has grown quite a bit. The capital is a city, which is known for its delicious fruits and for the food that is prepared there. There is also a lot of trade, as it is becoming a commercial center for the mountain and coastal regions of the country. Also, there are a lot of tourist attractions as it has a temperate climate. Many local and international tourists visit here. This is why most of the people are business people or they offer services for the locals or the tourists.\r\nLucinda, three years ago, started a stationary business in order to help her husband with the household expenses. She is able to do this business along with her housework, as this business is located in her house. Lucinda offers a variety of products for customers of all ages. She also sells candies and other fresh grocery items in order to increase her sales. She attends to her customers many hours of the day. Her business is stagnant because she doesn\u2019t have financial support. Thanks to some of her friends who belong to a credit group, she was able to learn about the services offered by the Alternative Foundation.

She will milk the cow to make dairy products to sell locally at the markets. This will increase the family income, and Maka will be able to provide better living conditions for her husband and child. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1320785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a milk cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Lagodekhi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-28T05:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-27T05:30:09Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":102.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":104.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":107.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":111.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":113.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":117.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.98,"local_amount":85.92,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":87.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570427},{"amount":51.87,"local_amount":84.11,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969065},{"amount":52.56,"local_amount":85.23,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":87.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749484},{"amount":54.82,"local_amount":88.9,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":90.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613392},{"amount":712.77,"local_amount":1155.84,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1181.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857110}],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T06:48:16Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T14:55:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":542306,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther lives in Kampala, Uganda.

He operates a retail shop, where he has spent five years. This has helped him to earn income, which he has used to satisfy his family's needs. He also does farming on a large scale.
