He works every day for about ten hours and feels that it is going well because of his good performance and the kind treatment he provides to others.\r\n  \r\nEdlemiro is very grateful for the Kiva loans because thanks to the support provided, he will be able to improve his home.  He wishes to purchase building materials for cementing and installing concrete floors in his home.  In this way, he will continue working and striving to achieve his great dream of being able to get ahead in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1322213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Thus Lily will continue working and making an effort to achieve her dream of having her own house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1322216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy dresses for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-28T21:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-27T21:40:17Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lily Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":206.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":207.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":218.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":224},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":235.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":241.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":251.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":262.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":271.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":282.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":292.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":304.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.07,"local_amount":206.99,"processed_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":209.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355776499},{"amount":81.24,"local_amount":207.43,"processed_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":210.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483419},{"amount":85.7,"local_amount":218.8,"processed_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":221.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889457},{"amount":87.73,"local_amount":224,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":227.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664356},{"amount":92.22,"local_amount":235.45,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":238.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775748},{"amount":94.73,"local_amount":241.87,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":245.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779084},{"amount":98.42,"local_amount":251.28,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":254.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054261},{"amount":102.96,"local_amount":262.86,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":266.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819187},{"amount":450.93,"local_amount":1151.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1167.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472158}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T02:24:50Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carrie N.","image":1077468}},{"id":542627,"name":"Rechie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rechie is 51 years old and married with three children.\r\n\r\nRechie works hard to provide for her family.

The house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and needs some serious repair. So, he is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT. He will use the loan to purchase insulation and building materials, such as fiberglass, foam, bricks and cement.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the renovations financed with this loan, the family will live in a warm and comfortable place, and more importantly, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

After his return, he began working as a taxi driver at another private business. His wife used to work as a saleswoman at a store and recently went on maternity leave. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. He is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT in order to purchase insulation and building materials such as fiber glass, foam, bricks and plants. As a result, the family will live in more comfortable and warm place. The renovated house will not allow heat loss and enable the family to burn less coal thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

Maritza vive junto a su familia en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una ciudad que cuenta un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Sus varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros y la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nMaritza ha visto la necesidad de aportar en su hogar para la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos y cubrir los gastos b\u00e1sicos de la casa, por lo que hace dos a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 a comercializar cosm\u00e9ticos por cuenta propia gracias al consejo de amigos. Para no descuidar los quehaceres del hogar y el apoyo que ella brinda a sus hijos con sus tareas, trabaja apenas 3 horas en las que tiene que arregl\u00e1rselas para entregar pedidos y ofrecer sus productos. Maritza desea invertir en un negocio fijo en el que pueda al mismo tiempo atender los quehaceres del hogar y a sus hijos, es por esto que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la adecuaci\u00f3n de un local para instalar un restaurante de comida t\u00edpica  de la zona que ella tan bien prepara con el saz\u00f3n \u00fanico de su familia.

She was only able to finish primary school, and from a very young age Maritza has worked hard to help her family make ends meet. She and her partner, Augusto, have two children and live in their own home. Maritza\u2019s children are in school, and she hopes to be able to support them in their studies all the way through to the completion of professional degrees. \r\n\r\nMaritza and her family live in the parish of R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, which is located in the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. The city of R\u00edo Verde has a growing business sector, and is also a centrally located zone that connects the mountainous and coastal regions of the country. With a warm climate and many tourist attractions, R\u00edo Verde has become a popular destination for foreign and Ecuadoran tourists. With the influx of tourism, the people of R\u00edo Verde have adapted and learned various trades and crafts that both support and benefit from the tourist industry. \r\n\r\nIn response to growing education and household costs, Maritza started a business selling cosmetics at the suggestion of some of her friends. As a complement to her household duties and time spent with her kids, Maritza works an average of three hours every day managing client orders, delivering products to customers and sharing her products with prospective clients. Ultimately, Maritza wants to invest in a stable business that will allow her to balance the personal and professional aspects of life. With her goals in mind, Maritza is requesting this loan, and she plans to use the support from the loan to set up her own small restaurant where she can prepare delicious food dishes that draw on her family\u2019s unique recipes, flavor and tradition.\r\n\r\nThe greatest challenge that has impeded Maritza\u2019s progress in this business endeavor up until now is her lack of access to startup capital and funds. She is very grateful for the support and confidence she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva, and for the support they provide in helping people all over the world fulfill their dreams. When she is able to get her restaurant up and running, Maritza does not plan to stop selling cosmetics, but rather to install a display case for her products in the new restaurant in hopes of combining her two businesses and improving her family\u2019s quality of life.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1322133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to set up a display case for her cosmetics and undertake the new challenge of opening up a small restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-29T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-28T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maritza  Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1056,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":107.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":109.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":111.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":113.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":115.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.27,"local_amount":88.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":90.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133249},{"amount":100.93,"local_amount":99.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313788},{"amount":103.49,"local_amount":101.66,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":103.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565393},{"amount":104.96,"local_amount":103.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":104.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814432},{"amount":107.05,"local_amount":105.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":107.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320604},{"amount":109.51,"local_amount":107.58,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":109.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856294},{"amount":111.31,"local_amount":109.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":111.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059869},{"amount":113.73,"local_amount":111.72,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":113.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995213},{"amount":115.74,"local_amount":113.7,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":115.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413648},{"amount":118.01,"local_amount":115.92,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102293}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T09:34:19Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":542699,"name":"Pamoja Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emanuel, who is in his 20s, is a married man staying together with his wife.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nLydia hopes to expand her business and dreams to give her family a good life.

His loan requests were rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is Gocha\u2019s small monthly income working as a baker at local bakery. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGocha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Gocha will rent a bakery. He plans to start his own bakery and increase the income of the family. He has chosen a commercial space, which is in very crowded area, so he hopes that the business will be profitable.

He is married and has three daughters who are 11, 6, and 3 years old. Their house was built from concrete blocks on land that he inherited from his father. His father is also economically dependent on him, because he can\u2019t work as a day laborer due to the disability that he suffered from being hit by a vehicle. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 works as a bus dispatcher for 29 buses that make their routes from his community to the city; they pay him 11 dollars per day. His wife works in the city\u2019s municipal market, preparing baked foods made from corn, cassava, potatoes, and plantains such as enchiladas and toasted cassava and plantains.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to purchase a car with a deep-fryer installed in order to fry plantains, cassava, and potatoes; and to purchase candy, beans, rice, sugar, candy, oil, coffee, and soft drinks in order to install a small store in his house; his father will be the one who runs it. \r\n\r\nIt will provide them with some initial working capital so that they can start their store; with this, his father will support him in generating income for the family, and they will purchase a car with a deep-fryer installed that will help his wife with her business.

In her business the regular customers are the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts, accessories and also for the maintenance of their motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNovelyn hopes to have new Tricycles and dreams that her family will settle quietly and peacefully. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1321644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

He is married and has two children, aged 8 and 2 years. In 2000, Adam  established his stationery business. He began his business as a means of generating revenue.

She lives in the Borjomi District with her 43-year-old husband, Jumber, and three children who are going to school. Irma requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the mini-bus that they own. Jumber gets private orders and he transports different things.\r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Irma will purchase potatoes at the wholesale price from Akhalkalaki district, bring it to Borjomi and sell it with a price markup among their villagers. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1321715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to trade with potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Borjomi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-29T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-28T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":85.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":88.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":90.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":92.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":95.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.71,"local_amount":75.71,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":75.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570432},{"amount":74.27,"local_amount":74.27,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":74.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969073},{"amount":75.41,"local_amount":75.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":75.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749492},{"amount":78.01,"local_amount":78.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":78.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613400},{"amount":79.37,"local_amount":79.37,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":79.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857118},{"amount":81.42,"local_amount":81.42,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":81.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133772},{"amount":535.81,"local_amount":535.81,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":535.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107363}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T15:25:14Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:40:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":542805,"name":"Saribek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saribek is 44 years old and lives in Sevan city with his wife.

All of her children depend on their parents for their education and food, and they all live together in a house she owns. \r\n\r\nMelita works selling used clothing.  Her sales locations are located in the towns found along the main highway in the city.  In times of higher demand, she sells in the communities located by the banks of the rivers.  She also exchanges clothing for domestic animals that she later raises and feeds and sells.  She has done this work for more than 11 years, however the need to care for her younger children has led her to think about starting a business that would allow her to be at home earning income.  Therefore, she wants to start a business renting video games.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she always has customers who need items of clothing.  She does not like having to travel for hours transporting heavy bags with her merchandise.  Now all of her hopes are in the new business she wants to start, although she says she will continue to sell clothing, but now from her home.  For this, she needs to have good infrastructure to provide security to the televisions she will use for the video game rental as well as the exhibition of garments that she is offering to the public.\r\n\r\nThis is Melita's fourth loan with Kiva and she is happy with the opportunity provided to make a good investment.  She is sure that she can make her payments punctually.  With the requested loan of 1200 soles, she will purchase used clothing and video games.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1322908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase secondhand clothes and video games.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-29T15:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-28T15:00:14Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":190.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":197.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":199.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":220.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.86},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.92,"local_amount":179.16,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":183.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578075},{"amount":75.49,"local_amount":190.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":195.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530303},{"amount":78.31,"local_amount":197.84,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":202.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975330},{"amount":78.86,"local_amount":199.21,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":204,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996599},{"amount":84.17,"local_amount":212.64,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":217.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864081},{"amount":87.25,"local_amount":220.43,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":225.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352423}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T17:58:52Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":542810,"name":"Watta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Watta is 42 years old and is single with four children between the ages of 13 and 20.

Four of them have already grown up and only two of them are still dependent on her. She has her own home, which she bought with her husband. Nilda works selling foodstuffs, buying large amounts of products and then selling them in her home. The items that she sells include rice, sugar, eggs, oil, canned goods, condiments and others. \r\n\r\nShe has had this business for around fifteen years and thanks to this, she has been able to educate her children and buy certain items for her home. In general, she works alone, but her daughter sometimes helps her out while her husband goes out to work. What she likes about her work is that she has time to do other activities in her home. The business is doing very well as she always has customers to serve, and for the moment, she is content to support herself with this.

In 1994, she began raising cattle and growing crops with start-up capital of only 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som. Today, she has 2 cows, 30 sheep, and 2 horses. Each year she works a 1.64-hectare plot of land where she plants beans and perennial herbs. Thanks to her hard work, her farm brings in monthly earnings of about 15,000 Som. For the purpose of further developing her business, Dilbara has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 Som to purchase bulls and horses for breeding to improve the stock.

","en":"Gulmira is 47 years old. After the fall of the Soviet Union, she began raising cattle, starting her business with just 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Thanks to her hard work, today her farm includes 1 cow and 25 sheep, and brings in monthly earnings of approximately 10,000 Som.

He lives in Gori District with his wife, Manana, and two children, who are going to school. Akaki requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is Akaki\u2019s small monthly salary. He is working in a bread bakery as a baker.\r\n\r\nAkaki requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Currently, she is only responsible for three of them. They are 22, 19, and 16 years old. She lives with them in her own home, which she built with a lot of effort and dedication. She works manufacturing charcoal. She rents some land far from the city that has been set aside for this purpose, and she works there every day. She buys leftover wood from nearby carpenters, and then she sets up ceramic ovens, where she puts all the wood she has collected. She covers it with sawdust and then lights it, and then waits several weeks until the wood is baked enough to be charcoal. She has had this business for three years, and she says that it is very demanding, but very profitable. She has three workers and occasionally works with her son-in-law. She also sells food in her home in the evenings. What she likes about her work is that she can work and feel useful to her family. It makes her feel good to know that she has more to give to others, even if it isn't much. She says that what she likes most is interacting with people. This is why she hopes that her business keeps growing at the same rhythm. This is her fifth Kiva loan. She is very glad for the financial support that she has received, because she feels confident that she can move forward with her work. She promises to make her payments on time. With the amount she is applying for, 1,500 soles, she will buy assorted boxes of discarded wood to use in manufacturing charcoal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1322950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-29T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-28T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.36,"local_amount":228.39,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":236.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578080},{"amount":95.57,"local_amount":238.94,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":247.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530308},{"amount":95.22,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":246.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975335},{"amount":102.69,"local_amount":256.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:01Z","rounded_local_amount":265.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996604},{"amount":106.52,"local_amount":266.3,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":275.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864086},{"amount":108.64,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":281.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352428}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T19:58:57Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":542900,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is an artisan from Ghana who specializes in designing hand-carved African masks.

The population of this area works in raising animals and working in agriculture. In addition, many are involved in the fabrication of traditional clothing and crafts. They are known for their embroidering and tailoring skills.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, the Francisquenses Trust Bank was formed by several enthusiastic women. There are currently 16 members of the group. The women are pleased to have four new members. They are most aware that these new members must be responsible in order to uphold the good credit history of the Trust Bank. During the monthly meetings, the women receive training where they discuss topics such as health, family planning, and children\u2019s rights, as well as business topics including budgeting and planning.\r\n\r\nMagdalena is one of the new members of the Trust Bank. She is 31 years of age and has four children, ranging in age from 18 months to 13 years. Three of the children attend school. She has had two years of formal education, which is the average for the women in her Trust Bank.\r\n\r\nMagdalena and her husband are tailors and make pants and jackets. They work for her brother and are paid by the pieces of clothing that they sew. However, Magdalena\u2019s dream is to be independent, to produce more products and increase her income. After learning about Friendship Bridge and its Microcredit Plus program, she joined the Trust Bank and applied for her first loan in order to buy her own sewing machine. In this way, she can produce her own products and contact wholesalers. In addition, she will be better equipped to support her children\u2019s education, so that they will enjoy a better future, perhaps a professional one!\r\n\r\nThe Francisquenses Trust Bank is most grateful to Friendship Bridge and Kiva investors. With the working capital that they provide in the form of loans, the women can become more independent, create or grow their businesses, and move themselves, their families, and community forward into a brighter future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6225,"image":{"id":1319705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Its members sell used clothing, sell breakfasts at open fairs, work in tailoring, and work in fashion, and his business is auto mechanics and pastry making.  He started his business nine years ago after he got into an accident and had to find other ways to earn an income.  He took an auto mechanics course that he could not complete and he worked in bakeries, where he was able to learn how to make cakes and cookies.  He had to face the loss of his wife and family, who left him on his own after the accident that left him crippled, but Javier had the courage to get ahead and take courses to learn.  Despite this pain in his life, he currently has a partner who has helped him and supported him in every way possible so he can get ahead.  Javier will use this loan to buy supplies for his small pastry shop, as well as a mixer and molds, which are staples for his work.  He is sure that this will be a very good season for his business and thinks he will even be able to make his payments ahead of time.  What he likes most about working with Fondo Esperanza is getting to meet very responsible people, as well as having a great adviser who is great at assuaging his

At this time of year here in Chile, because it is Holy Week, people don't eat meat, only seafood products, and she would sell much more, which would be very good for her business\u2014so she projects that it would be a very good sales period.\r\n\r\nAt Fondo Esperanza, she has got to gotten to know very good people, and besides her participation has been rewarding, also helping her to have a much greater desire to succeed. There is a lot of respect there and help from the advisers. She also tells us that she has made friends through her communal bank, as when the day comes to make a payment for previous loans, they get together with their fellow members and prepare a light meal, making cakes or cookies. In short, a rewarding experience."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1323405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

From a very young age, Abel helped his parents work their organic cacao farming operation, and agriculture has always been the livelihood and source of income for his family.\r\n\r\nOver time, as Abel became a father and husband and took on new responsibilities, he decided to start his own farming operation and purchase some farm land for cultivating organic cacao. Abel works extremely hard to tend and cultivate his cacao crops, and during the harvest season he hires additional workers to help with the increased workload. Time is of the essence during the harvest, as cacao fruit cannot be harvested when it is over ripe and still be in compliance with industry standards.\r\n\r\nAfter Abel harvests the cacao fruit, he extracts the seeds and dries them. He sells his seeds to establishments that pay varying rates for high quality versus low quality cacao. Abel has nine years of experience in this trade, and he plans to continue with his farming operation for the benefit of his family.  Abel is very grateful for the opportunity of this, his first loan, and he promises to make all scheduled loan repayments on time. He plans to use the support from this loan to purchase plaster and mortar for use in shoring up and strengthening the walls of his home, which is located in the middle of his farmland.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1323660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase plaster and mortar for strengthening the walls of his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-29T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-28T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":107.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":114.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":124.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":137.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":140.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":103.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":107.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578084},{"amount":47.05,"local_amount":117.62,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":121.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530313},{"amount":45.98,"local_amount":114.95,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975340},{"amount":50.11,"local_amount":125.27,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":129.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996609},{"amount":51.76,"local_amount":129.39,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":133.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864090},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":130.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":134.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352433},{"amount":55.17,"local_amount":137.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":142.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904285},{"amount":56.49,"local_amount":141.22,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":146.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090382}],"funded_date":"2013-03-30T10:36:23Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":543092,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is applying for a loan of $1,000 from TRM (Tuba Rai Metin).

All of this is arduous, and the best way to complete this work is with the support of hired laborers who work continually.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of time and the confidence gained from her years of experience, she hopes to keep working with her characteristic dedication.

As a source of income for her family, Bubusara began 20 years ago to engage in agriculture and livestock, starting with a sum of 18,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nThrough hard work, Bubusara today has on her farm one cow, one calf, one horse, and 20 sheep. Monthly income from the farm is about 6,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products and additionally from agriculture. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Bubusara turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to prepare for the spring field work. Bubusara plans to invest income from the loan in the business through the purchase of additional heads of cattle.

The group is composed of seven women and four men. Merensiana is on the right of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her on credit, consisting of the necessary materials to plant a half-acre of millet, sweet potatoes and sorghum. The 2013 Long Rains season will be Merensiana\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. She joined this year in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and to grow enough to feed her family. Merensiana described her harvest last year as good. She hopes that, as a One Acre Fund farmer, she will be able to join the ranks of the One Acre Fund farmers who have doubled their harvests in their first year with the program.

","en":"Aigul is 46 years old, married, and is raising two children. As a source of income for the family, Aigul over the course of 17 year began to engage in livestock and agriculture, starting with 17,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nThrough Aigul's hard work, her activities bring in about 7,800 som per month, which is the basis for covering the costs of food and household needs for the family. Income from the business allowed Aigul to expand activities of agriculture and especially livestock - her farm consists of three cattle, two calves, and 12 sheep. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Aigul turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock. Aigul plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her business, and also plans to use part of the proceeds to purchase a car.

find ways to ensure a decent future for them. For more than ten years, she has been engaged in selling clothes at the market. Malikekhan is mainly involved in trade, and is helped in the business by her sister. The life motto of Malikekhan: \"Don't look back, and look only forward!\"\r\n\r\nCurrently, Malikekhan plans to increase turnover.

The sale of milk brings in around 15,000 KGS each month.  With the goal of further developing her business, Buajar has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 75,000 KGS to prepare for spring field work.  The income from the loan will be saved for future business expansion.

She plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and to save for the future. During the 2013 Long Rains season, each group member will receive \u00bd an acre of agricultural inputs on credit. In total, Maua Group will receive six acres' worth of inputs, on credit.\r\n\r\n(The field officer is standing on the left of the photo.)"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1322351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of sweet potato, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-03-30T03:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-29T03:10:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Scolastic","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sifuna","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jerita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yulidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":39600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":39600,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":40802.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602919}],"funded_date":"2013-03-30T14:31:44Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:24:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":543252,"name":"Haitgul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Haitgul is 50 years old.

She is excited to improve her harvest as a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2013 Long Rains season. She plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to lease more acres of land for planting, and perhaps to invest in another business. During the 2013 Long Rains season, each group member will receive \u00bd an acre of agricultural inputs on credit. Judith\u2019s group will receive 8 1\/2 acres worth of inputs on credit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1319186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of millet, sorghum and sweet potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-03-30T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-29T13:50:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sussy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonorah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atilaiti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monicah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jannet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lazarus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorcas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":56100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":56100,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":57982.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602928}],"funded_date":"2013-04-02T01:43:33Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:24:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":543296,"name":"Loreta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loreta is 67 years old and lives with her husband in Sevan city.
