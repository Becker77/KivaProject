But as science in Armenia was in crisis after the Soviet Union's collapse, scientists got very low salaries, and there was no opportunity to do research, Martun faced lots of difficulties, like many Armenian scientists. He couldn't maintain his family's living standard or posture. So creating his own business was the only way for Martun to overcome that hard period.\r\n  \r\nHe built a small shop in his garden and started to sell vegetables and fruits at first. This deal was successful, and soon Martun enlarged his assortment of products (confectionery products, dairy products, spices, candies, nonalcoholic drinks, oil, meat, etc.). Now his business is going very well and Martun is able to meet his family's needs. Martun\u2019s son helps him greatly in this occupation.\r\n\r\nMartun needs 1,000,000 Armenian drams to add inventory. He intends to give his food market business to his son and fully involve himself in science, as he says that science is his main

resources.  Tozagul is just such a person.  She tries to improve her quality of life and to stimulate the economic growth of her family.  She is married and raised 2 children, Josef and Oisha, who are now adults.  Her husband works as a farmer and receives very little compensation.  His income is not enough to provide the family with all necessities.  Tozagul decided to help her husband for her family's sake.  With this goal, she took the course \"To Get Ahead\" offered by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate of completion.

She lives in poverty and it's very difficult for her to provide for four children alone.  She works as a nurse as a hospital--a position that doesn't pay well.  She urgently needs to find a source of additional income since her growing children have growing expenses.  With this goal, she has taken the course \"To Get Ahead\" offered by the Women's Business Association and received a certificate of completion.  Now, she is able to begin her own business and become successful at it.  She wants to organize a sewing business since she has a lot of experience in this area.  With the new income, she plans to pay for her children's education and to provide them with high-quality foods.  She is asking for a loan to buy a sewing machine to help get her started.  She awaits your

He owns an adobe house that he bought several years ago. He has two plots of land on which he grows cacao and organic coffee to support his family. He began working for himself after getting married, since this let him work a flexible schedule and save money to buy his first piece of land. He says that starting to work independently was not easy, since he lacked capital to hire workers and had to work doubly hard. This motivated him to grow his business.\r\n\r\nOne of the main activities associated with growing cacao is replacing older plants with plants from the seedling nursery by grafting the stems. You must buy seedlings and organic fertilizer and pay laborers to carry out this process. This is Mario's first loan cycle with Kiva. He is grateful for the opportunity and promises to make his payments on time. He needs S\/.2,000 soles to pay workers and to replace old plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1323681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-30T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-29T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":215.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":234.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":229.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":249.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":249},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":266.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":274.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":280.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.14,"local_amount":206.8,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":207.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578089},{"amount":91.15,"local_amount":235.22,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":236.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530318},{"amount":89.08,"local_amount":229.88,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":230.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975345},{"amount":97.08,"local_amount":250.52,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":251.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996614},{"amount":100.27,"local_amount":258.77,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":259.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864095},{"amount":100.91,"local_amount":260.41,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":261.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352438},{"amount":106.89,"local_amount":275.85,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":276.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904290},{"amount":109.48,"local_amount":282.55,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":283.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090387}],"funded_date":"2013-03-31T21:26:23Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":544019,"name":"Maximiliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maximiliana de 36 a\u00f1os de edad , esta casada con Alfredo y tiene de dos hijos con quienes vive en su casa construida a base de material noble.\nEs propietaria de un terreno agr\u00edcola el cual dedica integralmente a la producci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de cacao org\u00e1nico,llego a esta parte de su regi\u00f3n con motivo de hallar una mejor calidad de vida a base de productos tropicales, siendo el cacao uno los productos m\u00e1s comerciales,primero se inicio como jornalera y es donde conoce a su actual esposo con quien compra su terreno agr\u00edcola.Al ser el cacao un producto cuya atenci\u00f3n debe ser constante debe de contar siempre con un capital de trabajo el cual invierte en el contrato de trabajadores del lugar para diversas tareas complicadas as\u00ed como la compra de abono org\u00e1nico y dem\u00e1s gastos que genera su actividad.Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito con Kiva y se muestra muy agradecida por la confianza  brindada y espera ser puntual en el pago de su pr\u00e9stamo.\nDesea en esta primera ocasi\u00f3n contar con S\/.1,000 soles para contratar trabajadores e iniciar con la cosecha de las mazorcas de cacao org\u00e1nico.\n","en":"Maximiliana, age 36, is married to Alfredo.

Therefore, she will use her loan to buy more bags of charcoal to sell, indirectly helping her boost her overall sales. Esi wants to make her business self-sustainable, as soon as possible. As a result, she plans to channel the new profits from her expanded business back into her charcoal enterprise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1322689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more bags of charcoal to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Cape Coast","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.1 -1.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-03-30T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-29T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":206.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364730745},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":206.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372901797},{"amount":90.84,"local_amount":171,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":176.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381677786},{"amount":121.66,"local_amount":229,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":236.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390542011}],"funded_date":"2013-03-31T09:19:05Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:39:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":543503,"name":"Dora Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dora tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera de dos hijos de 10 y 8 a\u00f1os de edad, que est\u00e1n estudiando.

He comments that as a child he was always very engaged in learning various agricultural activities performed by his parents, thus achieving a firm knowledge about the cocoa production trade including the necessary technical conditions. After finishing high school and facing serious financial difficulties to continue his studies and start college, he decided to venture into the commercial world with the support and trust of his parents. As a way to generate income to help his parents he has been working for over two years on leasing medium-size farmland to proceed with removal of cobs achieving good revenue at the end of the season.\r\nTo optimize production he needs to apply maintenance to the field which starts from replacing outdated plants by new trees through grafting seedlings, for which capital is required, this is why it is necessary for him to ask his financial institution for funds. This maintenance is a collective work to be carried out with the support of workers at the site in order to obtain the desired output.\r\nHe has in mind to keep working on this field, so he can generate solid revenue that will enable him to start college and pursue a career in the agriculture field. He feels very comfortable with his work in the field and thinks it would be better to support the development of his locality with professional knowledge. Meliton feels very comfortable and grateful for the trust given, which allows him to access his first loan with Kiva, therefore he shows his strong commitment to responsibly comply with the payment of his dues. He requires for this first loan S \/. 1,000 nuevos soles to purchase seedling plants and hire workers in order to accomplish a good production by the end of the season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1324193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase seedling plants and hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-31T02:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-30T02:00:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meliton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":107.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":114.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":124.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":137.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":140.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":103.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578091},{"amount":47.05,"local_amount":117.62,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:48Z","rounded_local_amount":121.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530320},{"amount":45.98,"local_amount":114.95,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":119.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975347},{"amount":50.11,"local_amount":125.27,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":129.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996616},{"amount":51.76,"local_amount":129.39,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":134.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864097},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":130.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":134.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352440},{"amount":55.17,"local_amount":137.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":142.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904292},{"amount":56.49,"local_amount":141.22,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":146.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090389}],"funded_date":"2013-03-31T05:08:29Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":543564,"name":"Kenga's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kenga is a fifty-one-year-old father of eleven children.

However, it is not enough.  She has four children.  Matluba is a homemaker.  Her husband fattened cattle to sell, and when he had to leave to work abroad, Matluba decided to continue his work.At the moment, Matluba has one cow that gives 10-12 liters of milk.  She sells dairy products to her neighbors and acquaintances.  Her oldest son helps her with feeding the cattle.  Matluba plans to save money to build a home for her oldest son so that after he marries, he won't need to worry about a thing.  In order to reach her goal, she works day and night.  Matluba is asking for a loan to buy another cow as well as fodder for her animals.  Having fattened up the cattle over a period of a few months, she plans to sell them for a good price which will help grow her business..

a loan so he can increase his herd. He keeps several head of cattle at home, and this is his main work. The region where he lives is well-suited to fattening cattle and growing crops, and he has channeled serious efforts into this business so he can feed his family. He has a large family and it is difficult for him to provide for them on his own. Many of his neighbours have gone to Russia as migrant workers, but Abduvohid does not want to leave his family to go to a foreign land, which is why he is trying to earn enough income to take care of them while remaining at home. He plans to use the loan to buy more cattle and expand his business.

Farming inputs will be delivered to him on credit consisting of the necessary materials to plant a half acre of sweet potato, millet and sorghum. \r\n\r\nKamil is a new One Acre Fund farmer and is excited for the 2013 Long Rains season. He joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nKamil thought his harvest last year was poor. He hopes that as a One Acre Fund farmer he can have an excellent harvest.

","en":"Dilshodbek is an active and hard-working young man. He lives in a rural area, far from the city. He was unable to get a post-secondary education because of family circumstances and difficult times. He began working in his childhood, helping his father who raised him according to the principle that \"for a real man, even 40 professions are not enough.\" In this way, Dilshodbek became a jack-of-all-trades, able to earn a living in various occupations. He is currently selling building materials. He buys them from a supplier and sells them in his village for a profit. He also works in animal husbandry, mainly raising, fattening, and selling both cattle and smaller livestock. This is his main source of income which he uses to pay for his housing and living expenses, and to provide for his children's needs. He has a large family. He has a clever wife and 4 children. His parents and his brothers live with his family, and when he leaves to sell construction materials, his youngest brother and eldest son take over his other duties. Dilshodbek has to seize every opportunity to earn money so his family can live well today and not go hungry tomorrow. He has big plans for his children's futures. He wants them to learn a profession and to never want for anything in the future. To this end, he and his wife are saving up money and do not want to have to spend their little nest egg today.

","en":"Sanobar is an experienced teacher, having been in this profession for 25 years.  She teaches in her town school.  Sanobar has three children, but as she herself says, \"I have dozens of children, not just three.\"  Sanobar loves her students like her own children.  Her income from teaching used to be enough, but in the last few years, the need for additional income has arisen.  Her children are growing up and there are many expenses.

","en":"Firuza is a shepherd.  She is very knowledgeable in raising large and small cattle.  From her early childhood, she helped her father raise cattle because there were no sons in the family.  Now, the lessons and habits she learned from her father are Firuza's source of income.  For 30 years now, she has been \"bringing home the bread\" from her work in animal husbandry.

She is married and is raising three children, Nasibullo, Fatullo, and Kibris, who are all still minors.   Her husband is a migrant laborer in the Russian Federation.  Navbahor waited a long time for her husband to send them money, and she was expecting that the family could live on that money.  However, her husband still has not sent any money to support the family.  And so, Navbahor decided to start her own business.     \r\n\r\nNavbahor has loved to bake since childhood, when she used to help her mother.  Navbahor is planning to start a business in producing various cakes and sweets.  She wants to bake pies, cakes, and biscuits since there is a strong demand for them at the local market.

Hashem will use the loan, specifically, to buy furniture and develop the space of the shop. His ambition is to have the biggest barber shop in the area, and to provide his family with a better life and his child with the best education.\r\n\r\nRyada's Start-up Loan is exclusively for borrowers who are beginning new enterprises, not for existing projects. To qualify, a borrower must show a clear business plan and realistic potential for success. The borrower must also invest their own money and resources into at least 50 percent of the start-up enterprise. Ryada believes strongly in the potential of these borrowers and grants them a three-month grace period, to help them get their business off the

He has graduated from the Faculty of Ecology at Vanadzor State Pedagogical University. \r\n\r\nFrom time to time, Marat\u2019s father goes to the Russian Federation to work abroad. Marat didn't continue his studies to receive a master\u2019s degree because the family\u2019s financial situation worsened at that time. It was a most difficult time for his family. He decided he needed to organize business activity that would help him meet his family's needs.  \r\n\r\nMarat engaged in the perfume and household goods trading business and has been in that business for about a year. He buys a large amount of goods from Yerevan\u2019s wholesale markets and transports them in a rented car to the trade centers of Lori region and Vanadzor. \r\n\r\nHis business is going very well, and he is pleased. The profit from this activity is good, because there has been a great demand for perfumes in the Lori region in recent years, and they are sold in large volumes. Marat's parents are very proud of their only son and hope that, in the near future, he will reach a good financial level.\r\n\r\nMarat has asked for a loan of 1,000,000 Armenian drams to buy his own car to deliver goods, which will help him carry out his trading activity. He says he has spent much money on renting cars. Owning a new car will eliminate unnecessary costs.

Beekeeping is a relatively new activity in the area, but many farmers here are enthusiastic at the prospect of owning their own hives and gathering additional income from the sale of their honey.\r\n\r\nEzekiel is married, and has three children. He has been farming for 21 years, and is currently growing oranges. He is excited to work with Honey Care Africa because their hives are well made and their hive technicians give great service.

He uses his own minivan and his wife executes the role of conductor.\r\n\r\nThe house Mr. Sukhbaatar and his family live in has vulnerable external windows, walls and doors.

Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. All of her children live separately from their parents. She has been working at a private business entity since 2005. Using her previous loan, she has finished her house building but due to the lack of finances, she hasn't fully insulated the walls. So, she is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase insulation materials such as fiberglass, foam and cotton. After using those materials for insulation, she and her husband can live in a comfortable and warm place. Moreover, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

Its inhabitants are also very happy people who have a special gift in preparing dishes. The city of Chincha is the birthplace of major Peruvian sporting athletes and above all, it is where one of the traditional dances of our country, the Festejo, is danced. Carmen is mother to four children, who are now all adults, but for whom she has always fought to given them a dignified life and in particular, a true example of hard work and love. Rosa is a very hardworking woman, but when she has a bit of free time, she very much likes watching television and on occasions, she loves preparing one of her favorite dishes which is the delicious \u201cArroz con Pato con causa rellena\u201d. Given her minimal financial resources, she could only complete up to the 4th year of secondary school, but she would have liked to study to be a secretary.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day, Rosa works in her small business selling colado (a traditional bean dessert), which is a very delicious sweet that can be eaten with bread or eaten alone. She also sells sandwiches and drinks called champ\u00fas which is also a typical sweet in our country. Rosa works around 10 hours a day in her business, she believes that it the business is going well for her because she has a lot of experience and because she has an excellent sense of taste.\r\n\r\nCarmen is very grateful to the Kiva loan lenders as this is the second time that they have given their enormous help, and on this occasion, she will be able to buy merchandise for her business such as plastic food containers to sell her products, as well as supplies such as beans, chanchaca (a sweet sugary sauce), and sesame in bulk, etc. In this manner, she will be able to offer

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, about four hours south of Lima, the country's capital. It is lauded by  Peruvians as the \"Land of the Sun.\" It is known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (it experienced an 8.0 earthquake in 2007 and a 6.9 in 2011) as well as for its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives. It is also known, perhaps above all else, as the source of Peru's traditional national drink, Pisco. \r\n\r\nArmando's house and business are found in this hot and dry climate. In his free time, he likes to listen to music. In addition, since Peru is known for having some of the most delicious food in the world, one of Armando's favourite dishes is \"lomo saltado\" (a kind of stir-fried beef). Armando studied until the fifth year of secondary school but he would have liked to have studied law. He is a single father and has 2 children in primary school whom he loves very much.\r\n\r\nArmando works as a taxi driver and spends about 15 hours a day working. In a day, Armando can serve up to 60 customers. He thinks that his business is going very well because he treats his customers kindly, and because he is responsible and honest.\r\n\r\nHe is very thankful to Kiva lenders since this is the second time now that they have offered their wonderful support. With their continued help he will buy construction materials like roofing sheets and lumber, among other things. This will allow him to fix the roof of his house and prevent flooding from rain. This will help him to improve his quality of life and continue to fight to achieve his great dream: \"To give his children a profession and to have a new

He comes from the community of Tiraque, seeking better opportunities like the majority of people. His crops failed because of changes in the weather, something that is difficult to control.
