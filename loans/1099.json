","en":" Shuhrat is a 46 years old and he lives in a village with his wife and four children.  Neither Shuhrat or his wife have a higher education and they both are involved in raising their children.  In his free time, Shuhrat helps his wife with their crops: apricots, wheat and corn.  From a very young age, Shuhrat helped his family grow various crops.  A short time later, he rented a plot of land on which he could sow crops.  At first it was very difficult since he didn't have anyone to help him but his wife.  Shuhrat found from some acquaintances that Arvand give loans.  He turned to Arvand and received his first loan in 2011.  Shuhrat has a good credit history.  This year, he plans to take out a loan to buy mineral fertilizer to use in his wheat and apricot fields.  He is very grateful to Arvand for their support of poor people and he wishes every success for this organization."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1322527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Zuhriddin is a careful and kind young man. He is 21 years old, married and is raising two children. His children are small. His wife is a homemaker and raising children. Zuhriddin is the sole bread winner in the family. His parents are old and ill and are not able to help Zuhriddin. He has been cultivating crops and doing animal husbandry for more than five years. This year he did not collect a good harvest and that's why he was not able to save money for a new sowing. He needs to make a new sowing as soon as possible, but does not have money to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer. He also plans to buy cattle to expand his business. Zuhriddin is asking for a loan in the amount of 5,000 somoni to buy seeds, mineral fertilizer and cattle. He is waiting for your kindness and relies only on you.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1323779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Jurabek is 40 years old and he is married with five children at home.  His wife works on a farm and for more than five years, Jurabek has been involved in the production of tables, chairs, desks, etc.  He mainly takes orders from high schools and private schools.  His furniture is of a high quality and there is much demand for it among the public.  Jurabek loves his work and he knows every little detail of what he does.

She is 35 years old and married, and from this relationship she has three children who are 11, 9, and 3 years old. The two oldest children study in school. Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nLidia has a small button factory. With the help of previous loans, she bought what was necessary to be able to begin her business, and currently she has two machines that create these products. Every week, she turns over her buttons to merchants that then sell them to exporters in the city of Manta, who then bring these buttons to other countries to finish. She works from Monday through Saturday with the help of a sister to whom she pays a monthly salary. She has worked in this business for four years, and it is going very well for her.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan again to continue enlarging her business.

He has managed the business for such a long time because of the quality products he makes from his textile business.\r\n\r\nHe has a dream of expanding his business by developing it into a medium sized textile company, hence increasing his output and income.\r\nHis major challenge is inadequate funds to boost his business and the capacity to buy enough raw materials.  He has requested a loan of UGX  2,000,000  to put into the business to be able to meet his clients' demands. \r\n\r\nHis neighbors commend that Godfrey is a very hardworking, determined business man

They make a living in diverse activities, like in trade, selling food, and also in offering services.  \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Lorena.  She is thirty-seven years old, is married, and has two children, ages 12 and 8.  They study in high school and in primary school.  Her husband works in the city slaughterhouse.  \r\n\r\nLorena has a store in her home where she sells supplies, soda, ice-cream, clothing and bazaar items.

In spring, she also sells artificial flowers and wreaths. Her previous Kiva loan was used for flowers. There have not been any huge changes since then, but thanks to that loan, she was able to buy a new shipment of clothing and to help her daughter, who is a student. Oksana says that last year was a difficult one in retail because the purchasing power of the local citizens was lower than it had been, and as a result, her income decreased. However, she is not discouraged, and has hope for the future. Oksana is seeking a loan of 21,000 Ukrainian Hryvnya to buy artificial flowers and wreaths. She plans to make a good profit from them and to buy clothing for the summer season.

His nuclear family is made up of him and his wife. He is a baker.\r\nHis business consists of making French bread and sweet bread. He has 21 years of experience. He learned the trade from his father; he started as a helper in the bakery and when his father died, he bequeathed it to him. He makes bread every day. He sells it in his home and to other customers that make custom orders. He makes all his sales in cash and buys his inputs from companies that distribute flour, butter etc.\r\nAt this point in his life, when he has already raised his children, he works in the bakery to support himself and his wife. This is a business that he really likes, and he knows how to contribute to the feeding of his customers, since for the people of Masaya bread is one of the essential components of breakfast. He currently needs financing to be able to purchase flour, sugar, lard, butter, yeast and firewood, since demand is strong and he also brings bread daily to Masaya hospital. He thinks that this loan will help him to increase his income and make them more comfortable.

Her husband decided to raise livestock as this brings in at least a small income.  Back then the children were small and there was enough money, now when the children grew up expenditures also increased and they try to work as hard as they can.  Raising livestock is the only source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nThey also dream of building their own house, because they live with their parents and it is very crowded.  Matluba does not want to sell the livestock because they can use the profits from the livestock to slowly start building their house.  She plans to buy more livestock for this purpose, so that her husband can resell it for a higher price after some time.  Matluba and her husband are hoping for loan help from Arvand to buy livestock.

Before that, he was a migrant worker in Russia.  He worked there as a laborer.  However, due to the difficulties of labor immigration, Inomjon decided to return to his homeland to work and provide for his family.  His neighbors advised him to breed livestock as a source of income.  He has a wife and a baby.  He lives with and cares for his parents.  Besides livestock, Inomjon also farms.

He is the father of two children, ages 20 and 22. His wife works as a teacher in a primary school. He began his business of planting coffee five years ago, since before that he planted corn and beans. But on noticing that the lands were suitable for growing coffee, he decided to establish an area of about 1.75 acres with a little money that he obtained from the sale of corn and beans. That is how he began this business, and little by little he has expanded his area of cultivation. The lands that he uses are his own. He would like to sell his product to other buyers of coffee who would pay him a better price for the product.\r\n\r\nThe expectations that he has from his business are to continue expanding the planting area and improving the production.\r\n\r\nHe is applying for the loan to buy fertilizers and pesticides and pay for labor to maintain about 7 acres of coffee in production.

However, his main occupation is animal fattening, an activity which brings good revenues.  Fahfiddin is currently trying to expand this animal fattening business.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to buy a car.  Indeed, each time he has to transport livestock and timber, he needs to order a car, which is difficult and expensive.  This is why he has turned to MDO Arvand, and really hopes to receive help from this organization.  Buying a car would make it easier for him to transport livestock and to fulfill the orders he receives as a

She is a housewife; because of her age it is very hard to find work. Her children are all grown and she would like to help them obtain a good education. Her husband left to work in Russia, so Dilafruz wants to find her own way to provide for herself and help her children. \r\n\r\nShe raises several sheep and a cow at her house, which earns her a small income.

He is married and has four children. He raises cows. His family helps with the business. His oldest son rather than a shepherd, takes the animals to pasture. Recently Shuhrat bought a horse for his son so that he could shepherd more easily. Moving through the mountains on foot is very difficult. \r\n\r\nRight now Shuhrat needs to buy a lot of hay and extra feed since his stock of feed ran out in early spring. To keep his animals from going hungry he came to Arvand for a loan. Shuhrat plans to use the funds received to buy feed for the livestock.

","en":"Bahromali is a 55 year old man. He is married and has children and grandchildren. He works as a guard at a workshop. Most of the work he does is raising livestock, at home. Bahromali takes animal husbandry seriously. Every 4-5 months he takes animals to the market to sell at a good price, and at the same time buys a pair of lambs or a calf to raise. He also shears sheep and sells their wool. His wife spins the wool into thread, which allows him to sell it at a higher price.

His business is located in the city center and his main customers are all ages and sexes. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 805,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan of Le 3,000,000. Alpha Bakarr has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan to buy more bedspreads, window linings, frames and flowers.

is one of Esperanza Internacional's entrepreneurs. She came to Esperanza Internacional almost three years ago for a loan to expand her business. She is receiving her 6th loan and will use it for her home's improvement. She is running a business where she sells underwear. She lives in a rural area in the Puerto Plata.\r\n\r\nFulgencia is the mother of two children, one of whom lives with her and her long term partner. Because they are living in deteriorated housing, she is requesting a loan which she will use to improve her situation by purchasing building materials to finish her house. She will buy a door, ceramic tiles for her floor, and she will cover with cement her concrete blocks walls. With this loan she will be able to finish building what she started several years ago. \r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional is running a program where their clients pay back their loans, fulfill the commitment to expand their businesses, and show reliability in their groups. They then can request loans to improve their house structure while they are running their businesses and attending group meetings.

This form of work will allow her to generate income to support her household as much as she can, as she is married and has four children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the savings program."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":1323599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy beer and soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-04-03T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-03T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":4850,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascuala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":33358.99,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3328.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3329.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":483.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":483.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":484.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":494.34,"local_amount":3400.17,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3415.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625442},{"amount":483.96,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021399},{"amount":483.96,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809207},{"amount":967.91,"local_amount":6657.44,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6687.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669277},{"amount":483.96,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915038},{"amount":483.95,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197669},{"amount":483.96,"local_amount":3328.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153440},{"amount":967.96,"local_amount":6657.78,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6688.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615045}],"funded_date":"2013-04-22T00:21:57Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:41:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":544148,"name":"Radhi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called \u201cRadhi\u201d; it is made up of three ladies and one man.

He lives in Rustavi District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and an infant granddaughter. Nodar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the income of his wife and daughter-in-law. They both are working as salesladies. In addition, his son works as an artisan and gets a small monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNodar requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

He is a native of the Nacintal district on the outskirts of Teustepe. He is married and is the father of four children, ages 6, 10, 13, and 15. All of them are in school. His work is farming. He works in one of the most common activities in the city of Teustepe, which is planting corn, beans, and wheat. He has been in this business for more than 12 years. Due to his impoverished condition, he was not able to go to school. He began his agricultural activity by helping his parents on the land. Then he decided to become independent. He began to plant for himself with his own money. Leandro not only takes charge of planting, but he also milks his cows. In his planting work he pays helpers. He sells his products in Managua. His expectations are to increase the production of his plantings and his animals.\r\n\r\nLeandro needs this loan to pay for labor and buy supplies, compost, and fertilizer, which he needs to plant beans and corn this year.

It's made up of eight members and governed by a board of directors of which Emma is the president.  The various businesses of the communal bank members include cleaning product sales, ice cream sales, knitting sweaters, hardware store, leggings and shawl sales, cosmetics sales, sweater sales, and food sales.\r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit small business entrepreneurs such as Emma.  She says she has been a member of Pro Mujer for a year and a half, having been invited to join by a loan officer from the institution who visited her at home.\r\n\r\nCurrently she has a business knitting and selling women's sweaters.  She says she started this business on the recommendation of her sister, who taught her the characteristics of the business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she's getting now is to increase her capital by buying wool, which she'll acquire from the markets in the city of La Paz and, after production, sell in her sales stall.  This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her household as much as possible, because she's single and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer she says the health support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1324106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-04-03T19:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-03T19:20:06Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva Joanna\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16161.6,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1623.1},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1623.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1623.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1623.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1623.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1623.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1623.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1623.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1611.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":227.61,"local_amount":1565.37,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625444},{"amount":236.01,"local_amount":1623.1,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1630.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021401},{"amount":236.01,"local_amount":1623.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1630.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809209},{"amount":236.01,"local_amount":1623.1,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1630.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669279},{"amount":236.01,"local_amount":1623.1,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1630.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915040},{"amount":236.01,"local_amount":1623.1,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1630.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197671},{"amount":472.02,"local_amount":3246.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3261.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153441},{"amount":236.01,"local_amount":1623.1,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1630.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615046},{"amount":234.31,"local_amount":1611.43,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1619.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736032}],"funded_date":"2013-04-05T08:06:46Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:19:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}}]}
