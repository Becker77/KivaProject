After graduating from secondary school and serving in the Army, Aidarbek got married. His parents gave a milk cow to the couple, thereby making a distinctive contribution to the start of Aidarbek\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nAidarbek is a hard worker and his strong efforts allowed him to broaden his business with three cows and two bulls. His wife milks the cows and sells about 20 liters of milk daily to the loyal customers. Also, Aidarbek cultivates a small plot of land with red beets and cabbage. Aidarbek plans to use this loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms to buy one milk cow and sheep, because it\u2019s a good way to find the means for subsistence of the five member family. \r\n\r\nAidarbek believes strongly that his children will become educated in the future.

J., 28 years old, is married to Philip S. J., a driver. The couple is blessed with only one son. These young parents are very industrious and full of dreams. They wish to have a stable business, to build their own house, to send their only child to a better school and to live comfortably and happily. It was 2008 when she joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), partner Microfinance Institution of KIVA in the Philippines. She joins ASHI and KIVA because she believes that these institutions can help her achieve her dreams. When she received her loan she used it properly on farming and now she earns a profit. She also maintains very good performance and shows discipline as a member. She is rewarded for her effort. Now, she is applying again for a new loan to use towards their rice field production. This loan will be used to purchase sacks of organic fertilizers, pesticides and to pay for the farm labor. The income from this business will help the couple in their daily needs and in preparation for the future of their children. The couple's plan is to expand their business and to seek an additional income generating project venture in the near future. They are hoping that ASHI and KIVA will always support their plan and their financial needs to be freed from the cycle of poverty.

She is married and has 3 children, all of who have their own familes. Only one of them lives with her.   \r\n\r\nShe is from the city of San Antonio. She has always been a merchant; she would buy and sell merchandise in a variety store and as a street vendor. Later, little by little she saved up and decided to outfit a well supplied convenience store in her home. That way, she wouldn't have to leave her house and she could spend more time with her family. Her husband is not working at this time due to his age, but he helps her attend to the business, which they have had now for 25 years.\r\n\r\nShe has turned to loans because it allows her to keep costs down by buying merchandise up front.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

This is 32-year-old Stela D. from Mwanza. She is married and has five children, who are between the ages of 9 and 15 years old. Since 2000, Stela has made a living running a grocery store where she sells  onions, tomatoes, chilli and cabbages. It is the kind of place that local people send their children running to when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and need a missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nShe works at this business for six hours per day, seven days per week. Stele earns about $100 a month from her business, and is requesting a loan of $200 to buy bananas, tomatoes and cabbages. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Stela thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":350615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy bananas, tomatoes and cabbages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-10T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665061},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105773},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022883},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868124},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757320},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146414},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984575},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015261},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740278},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773409},{"amount":22.7,"local_amount":27272.7,"processed_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151956406}],"funded_date":"2009-07-10T19:02:18Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":125364,"name":"Adelfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelfa R. is a 39-year-old mother of five.

He lives in his parents' house and what he most wants is to be able to give them a peaceful old age.\r\n\r\n Jos\u00e9's days start very early, by 6 in the morning he leaves with his inseperable tricycle in search of clients to offer his transportation service.  The markets and busiest places in the city of Juliaca are the main areas that he works since he knows many people there need his services.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his job is that he gets to travel through the streets of the city while at work.  He has been doing this for four years and he considers the most difficult part of his jobs are the long hours at night, running the risk of having his tricycle stolen. He is willing to sacrifice a lot for his job. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future he wants to have a business that his parents can take care of, perhaps a grocery store, where they could work without too much effort.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP, and he knows to pay all of his dues on time like he did last time.  He is very responsible in his village bank and he does not want to look bad in front of the other members. With the loan of 1000 soles he will buy new tires for his tricycle, since he has been using them a long time and he can no longer travel the  speed he used to.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

They are on average 45 years old with 5 children and live in the M\u00e9dine district of the town S\u00e9gou (4th administrative area of the Republic of Mali.) They know each other from the neighborhood and family ties. They all do business with various goods. It is in the hopes of increasing and varying their business that they decided to work with the micro-finance non-profit Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter six repaid team loans, the Yelenkoura group is on to its 7th loan. This loan would be used to buy food condiments (4 large boxes of condensed tomatoes, 2 bags of cooking salt, 1 box on bouillon cubes, 20 kg of dah seeds) ; various goods to display ( 1 bag of sugar, about ten packets of tea that is highly regarded by their customers, 4 boxes laundry soap, 1\/2 box mosquito repellent spirals); 40 bags of charcoal; 4 bags of millet, 1 bag of powdered baobab fruit and the ingredients for dried cream.\r\n<p>\r\nThey supply themselves with the food condiments and various goods in Bamako, the charcoal is made on site, the carriers for large goods come from Fana. The millet and the powdered baobab fruit come from the market in Medine. To make dried cream: you must grind the millet to a fine flour, roast a part of this millet, remove the bran, and wash it well. To that we add oven-dried rice and powdered baobab fruit and sift it several times. Add the needed ingredients and reduce them to a flour. Mix well and let them dry in required hygienic conditions. The seeds of the dah are modified into \"datou\" used in our sauces instead of \"sounbala.\"\r\n<p>\r\nThe sales are done from home, in the from of house deliveries, at market, and retail by cash or credit. The customers are made up of both women and men. They hope to earn on average 55.00 FCFA monthly, which would repay the interest on the loan, cover the cost on the goods, the purchase of school stationary and soap, and enable them to participate in social events. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Colleen Creegan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":429499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"The purchase of varrious goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou     \t       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Penda      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763561},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152392},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991234},{"amount":246.42,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021504},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746306},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778858},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.84,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961107}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T19:34:34Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Colleen Creegan","image":367715}},{"id":158347,"name":"Sonia Alberta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sonia is a single mother who opened a bakery 16 years ago as a way to support her two children.

She has been managing a water station while also renting out some apartment rooms. These two activities make up her total income per month. She also does a little food vending while maintaining her two main businesses.\r\n\r\nLuz has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a 45,000 Philippine peso loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by allowing her to pay for maintenance and repairs for her apartments. She will also pay for the needs and bills of the water station and buy groceries to replenish her current product stock.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her businesses will continue to grow.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":519715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water Distribution","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance and repair for her apartments, to pay for needs and bills of the water station and to buy groceries to replenish her current product stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":11250,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":11494.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136652053},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3831.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144684662},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7663.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152028563},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3831.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159607986},{"amount":427.08,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":19157.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821518}],"funded_date":"2010-04-13T19:43:42Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":195872,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca is a 31-year-old hardworking lady.

She earns her living by operating a tailoring\/sewing business. Her husband Benjamin, who is 55 years old and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are between 14 and 32 years old. Felisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Felisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. Felisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Linet will educate her children.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Jaribu Women group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nThe photograph shows Linet and her group with the field officer who is on the far left.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":930737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ailen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":368009,"name":"Celsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celsa works hard to support her family.

is a group loan to be shared by five entrepreneurs from the Khelcom 2 Association, led by Ousmane N..  The group describes their business:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cContext of the project:  Located in the tourist zone of Cap Skirring, the village of Boucotte Ouolof is a village of farmers who dedicate themselves to producing fresh fruits and vegetables.  In fact, this village is the source of vegetables for the hotels in Cap Skirring.  The dissatisfaction of the hotels and the fact that the demand exceeds the supply drives hotels, for example the Club Med, to purchase their fresh produce in Dakar [Senegal\u2019s capital, a two day\u2019s journey from Boucotte Ouolof].

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":6865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of gardening equipment and seeds; installation of drip irrigation system; transportation to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Boucotte Ouolof","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.416389 -16.750556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-09T01:33:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ousmane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-25T01:26:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1375,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-04-21T21:05:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13450},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:00:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16986},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:06:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17001},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:42:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34433},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:03:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41462},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50201},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:31:07Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63329},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80033},{"amount":375,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93772}],"funded_date":"2006-12-11T01:26:06Z","paid_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6572,"name":"Margerete","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maggie is a client of Kraban Support Foundation and has been educated in the TEACH Lending program.

He is in the livestock business. He purchases and sells livestock. He goes through this cycle every 2-3 months. Selling livestock doesn't provide him with a continuous flow of income. In the beginning, it is necessary to feed the livestock for a a few months so that it reaches its slaughter weight. After that, it is ready to be put up for sale. And only after that process, it is possible to obtain a profit after the sale of livestock. But since 3 months is a long time, Muzaffar also sells produce at the marketplace, which provides him with a constant flow of income. It is profitable for him to have two businesses, with which both his wife and older son help him out.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":241747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For business expenssion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-12-22T06:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muzaffar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10229614},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20427128},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120637},{"amount":171.42,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015756},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599490},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52993933},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.42,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":583.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215203}],"funded_date":"2008-12-28T05:23:41Z","paid_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vasilisa Budnikova","image":387310}},{"id":84420,"name":"Francisca Eufemia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn el mercado municipal de Chichigalpa, la se\u00f1ora Francisca S. se dedica a su actividad de venta de carne ofreci\u00e9ndola en su establecimiento el cual es muy visitado frecuentemente por los clientes que a diario compran la carne.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising chickens for sale.  M\u1ef5 has been engaged in this business for over 11 years and earns approximately 1500000 VND a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, M\u1ef5 joined TYM Fund to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  M\u1ef5 has successfully repaid a previous loan from TYM Fund.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby chickens to raise & sell in the future.  M\u1ef5 is now requesting a new loan of 15000000 VND, which will be used to build a shelter for her chickens.  The loan will be the seventh loan taken out by the borrower from TYM Fund.  M\u1ef5 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her

He has been a struggling father who has made every effort to educate his children and provide for their needs and necessities. He has lost so many lives in the family: his mother and dad, brothers, and a sister. This has forced him to take on additional burdens in taking care of their children and grandchildren. Faced with the these challenges, the need arose for him to join a financial institution from which he could borrow money and help make ends meet. Encouraged by his friends, and fueled by the need for more capital for his business, he joined GHAPE. Since then, he has benefited immensely from the organization.\r\n<p>\r\nIf he is approved for his fourth loan, J. plans to invest in the selling of beer and the rearing of pigs. More specifically, he will buy piglets, pigs, and pig feed. Experience has taught him how to manage a business like this. The business site is located in a very good area, and pigs are in high demand as their meat is used for many social occasions such as marriages and funeral ceremonies\r\n<p>. \r\nJ. loves GHAPE because of the low interest and the social interactions among members. \r\n<p> \r\nAbout the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE):\r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and provides poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":350667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/

The family's main source of income is meat sales and she has been involved in this activity for the past 9 years working from 8 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon.  She has earned good profits.  All these years of work have turned her into quite the expert on meats and many of her customers prefer to buy from her because of the trust Gloria inspires in them.  She likes her work very much in that it allows her to socialize with her friends who always come to buy ingredients from her for their daily family meal preparation.  For the future, she would like to have a larger, better equipped, stand.  She knows, however, that little steps lead to big accomplishments so she works steadily and patiently waits for the improvements her business gets over time.  This is her second loan from MFP and she is very happy with the support she gets from her fellow members, all of whom are very punctual and good friends.

She is 46 years old and is married with 5 children aged 14 to 31.  Garmai did not have the opportunity to go to school due to poverty.\r\n\r\nShe and her family live and work in the Old Road Community in Sinkor which is about 5 miles from downtown Monrovia, Liberia.  For 19 years, Garmai has been selling foodstuffs such as rice and oil. She buys her goods wholesale and sells them retail to residents of her community. Garmai started selling with 4000 Liberian Dollars and now has 20,000 Liberian dollars as working capital.  She interacts well with customers in order to encourage them to continue buying from her.  Garmai will use this loan to purchase more rice and oil.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":6888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Irrigation pump purchase","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Nder","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.255 -15.887222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-11T16:08:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-27T03:13:37Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":975,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T16:39:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34387},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T03:56:37Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41420},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T16:58:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50156},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:21:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63297},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79994},{"amount":815,"local_amount":815,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:30:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":815,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93741}],"funded_date":"2006-12-13T03:13:37Z","paid_date":"2007-12-08T21:30:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6588,"name":"Santi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Santi is a 27 year old mother of 3 children.

She divorced her husband a few years ago and currently lives in the house she inherited from her parents. She is a very hard-working woman who goes out early in the morning to get the fish she needs to sell and in this way supports her family. She has done this work for 14 years during which time she has become an expert in the business. She enjoys it because it is honorable and quiet work, although sometimes is it tiring and the smell of fish is hard to get rid of.

The livestock eats the mountain grass and Soliboy can save on the livestock feed.  With the start of winter Soliboy sells part of the fattened livestock, but he does not purchase livestock.

Abdufato has been in the bakery business for 10 years. So that he could provide for his family, he started working as a trainee in one of the local bakeries at the age of 16. For one work shift that usually lasted 17 hours he was only paid 6 to 7 loaves of bread, which was not enough for his family.<P>\r\n\r\n He started looking for a space so he could open his own business. Once he found one, he started his own bakery. In the beginning, Abdufato was only baking special orders for weddings because he was short of cash. After a period of time, when he accumulated more funds, he started producing bread for sale in the market. Currently, his father and two hired employees are helping him in the business. Abdufato is asking for additional funding so that he can increase his production.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Three years ago her mother and siblings supported her with a small loan that she needed to start selling some groceries from a space in her home. At first she purchased rice, noodles, soft drinks, diapers. shampoo and cookies, and with time earned an income thanks to her hard work and perseverance. She reinvested her profits in merchandise for her small business, which she moved to her mother-in-law's house. With additional loans she was able to purchase some ice cream and cosmetic equipment because in the future she plans to set up a beauty salon since there isn't one in her area. Thanks to her sales, she is able to help her husband with family expenses, like food and health care, since neither has insurance.

as a basic human need to establish a business that will work. Gloria has finished college and is running a household with seven children along with her husband Nivarjo. From the province of Bohol, their family has come to reside in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nGloria runs a peanut butter sandwich business. She personally makes the sandwiches and sells them to her neighbors. She also sells chicken meat in her stall in the President Aquino public market. She has been in these businesses for nine years now. She is able to earn around 10,000 PHP monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Gloria has requested a 9,000 PHP loan. She will use this money to enhance her businesses by buying more quantities of bread and peanut butter, as well different kinds of meat to give her customers more options to choose from. She is sure that the loan will make her business more profitable.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Gloria faces is the difficulty her customers have when it comes to paying their debts. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t have many customers, resulting in low income. She is also overly concerned with her children whom she notices have become quite hardheaded. But she chooses rather to capitalize on these challenges and turn them into stepping-stones toward her dream of having a successfully growing business and a long, good life for everyone in her family.

The main advantage of his business is that it generates a good income, but he also has plenty of competition and lately his sales have declined.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan Darkin is requesting will be used to buy several bundles of used clothing so that he can restock his business with various styles of clothes, especially for the rainy season.  His goal is to grow his business and convert it into a formal store so that he can continue supporting his mother financially.  She is an elderly woman who makes bread and sells it as a street vendor.  \r\n<p>\r\nDarkin has participated in five loan cycles with FAMA and the loans he has obtained have allowed him to remain financially active.  He has submitted his payments on time.

Leti is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.

Susanita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Susanita's second loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She is 27 years old. Anelita is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Anelita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products, as well as firewood in the local community. Anelita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Anelita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anelita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Anelita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This is 35-year-old Juliana M. from Mwanza. She is separated from her husband, and has 3 children between the ages of 11 and 19 years old. Juliana has been running a grocery business since 2008. Her shop is a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof. She sells items such as beer, soda and water. She works in her business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Juliana currently earns about $160 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase drinks like beer, soda and water. In the future, she plans to open another business. Juliana thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase drinks like beer,soda and water.

Margie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. Margie is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Margie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:<p>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

They live among the poor communities in Bagong Silang, Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nMaria Elena has been into cooking and serving food to her neighbors until she opened a small variety store a few months ago.  She makes a net profit of P4,000.00 per month which she uses to sustain the studies of her children.\r\n \r\nShe has just finished repaying a previous loan with the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative which qualifies her for a new loan so she applied for a new loan in the amount of P14, 000.00.  This would be her tenth loan cycle with CCT.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase additional merchandise for her store so she won\u2019t need to come to the market as often.\r\n\r\nMaria Elena works hard to sustain her children\u2019s education, hand-in-hand with her husband working miles away.  She also dreams of owning a bigger grocery store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

His goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. His dream is that God will continue to provide him with more years of life so he can get ahead and fulfill his goals.

Rauf thanks Kiva and all the lenders who make this help possible.     \r\n       \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON International's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married, 57 years old and he is father and breadwinner for a family of five children, whose ages vary between two and 17 years old. He also has responsibility for five other relatives. He has been a shareholder-member of the Baye-Laye savings bank since June 2009 and has never had a loan from the institution. Previously, he was an apprentice mechanic but now he has a mechanics certificate. It is above all during the period of Magal and Tabaski that his activity really booms. He is requesting a loan of 500,000 francs to repair his fast coach which has broken down. It is a vehicle which allows him to provide transport around town for his passengers, and this brings him a daily income, which enables him to manage his family and save on a regular basis to provide for unforseen expenses.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

Already widowed at such a young age; she manages to be mother and father to four children, one of whom is already in high school, while the younger children are enrolled in elementary school. By the grace of God, Minerva has managed to support her older child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of them all the way through college--a dream for most Filipino parents like Minerva as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMinerva operates a food stall where her main products are mostly breakfast fare. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Minerva's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products such as meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMinerva dreams of being able to give all her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own stall someday, so that she can save her rent money and use it for her children. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":594879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in Samana, a lush, rugged peninsuL. with a nascent tourism industry.
