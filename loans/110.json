G\u00f3mez is 55 years old and lives in San Jacinto, a municipality in the Bol\u00edvar town center known for the production of artisinal goods like hammocks, purses, and backpacks.  Amaris is shopkeeper and producer of artisinal goods, a traditional activity inherited from her mother.  The products that she makes the most are backpacks that she makes at night, and hammocks that she makes with her sisters and mother.  Additionally, Amaris works in a company in the morning, while her husband does field work.  She has had two loans with Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo which have improved her family income and allowed her to improve her living conditions.  The loan she requests will be invested in the purchase of thick yarn to to make woven hammocks on a vertical loom, and also to make purses and backpacks. \n\nShe expresses that she has seen difficult times during periods of violence when her husband could not work in the countryside, when it was up to her to take charge of the majority of household expenses; thank God the situation has changed and today most sajacinteros[those from San Jacinto] can work in the countryside again.  In the future, Amaris dreams of improving her home, which she owns, and of helping one of her three kids finish their university studies this coming year.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Su historia est\u00e1 siendo usada para representar a los dem\u00e1s miembros de su grupo y a los clientes de Esperanza, tanto los haitianos (quienes en su mayor\u00eda ha emigrado hacia la Republica Dominicana desde Hait\u00ed, algunos de ellos recientemente) y los dominicanos, quienes por lo general viven en comunidades muy pobres, esta zona, como muchas otras zonas de escasos recursos en la Republica Dominicana, carecen de agua potable y energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica constante. Este grupo se encuentra ubicado en una zona de pocos recursos de La Romana, una ciudad cuya econom\u00eda depende de la producci\u00f3n de Ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar y la industria del Turismo de alto nivel.","en":"Esperanza is the coordinator of the Silva Groups 1 and 2.  Her family is made up of 4 children and a husband. Both of them, (father and mother) have raised and educated their children.  Her most difficult challenges, she tells us, have been in her role as a mother trying to provide a better future for her children.\r\n\r\nEsperanza is very excited to receive her first loan through Esperanza International.  She has had her business for about 20 years, which she started by selling silver jewelry such as rings and chains, using money that she had saved up.  Esperanza is planning to invest the proceeds of her loan in the purchase of undergarments in dozens, for men, women and children.  She will use her income for new clothing and in such a way will be able to grow her business and achieve her dream of being able to finish building her house.  She also wishes to maintain good health and have a more financially stable life.\r\n\r\nThis member of the Esperanza Group joined us because of the flexible loan payments and better interest rates.  Her background is representative of  the other members of the group and customers of Esperanza, the Haitians (who for the most part have immigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them recently) and the Dominicans, both generally live in very poor communities.  This area, like many other areas of limited resources in the Dominican Republic, is lacking in drinking water and constant electrical energy.  This group is located in a low resource area of La Romana, a city whose economy depends on the production of sugar cane and the high level tourist industry.

He is a kind and hard-working man who lives in his own home with his wife, 52 year-old Ana, and his two dependent children, 19 year-old Luis and 11 year-old Isabel, for whom he would like to provide a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nJorge grows coffee, bananas and cassava.  Every day, very early in the morning, he goes out to work on his farm with the goal of working hard so that he grows good-quality crops.  What he most likes about his work is cultivating his land.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They are the parents of 5 children, 3 of the youngest who live with them in their own home. For 10 years she has worked selling used furniture from her home. Her work starts with a trip to \"La cachina\" in Lima where she selects and buys the furniture. Once back in her home city, her husband and children perform the work of sanding and lacquering leaving them shining and like-new. She can then sell them for a higher price, which is still within reach of her customers' pocketbooks. After all of this pre-work, she earns about 300-500 soles per piece although it takes a few days to sell one piece.  Mercedes is happy with her business especially since it involves her husband and children. The greatest demand for furniture is near the end of April when the coffee harvest comes in because then folks start buying furniture - it is the best time for earning capital and putting something away for a rainy day. Mercedes is eager to work especially since she has taken on the job of representative for her community bank and is committed to working for the group, and making payments on time. This is her first loan for which she is very grateful. The funds will be used to buy furniture which serve as capital for her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Carre\u00f3n, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":269384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":131.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423751},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":131.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117036},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":131.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011949},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":131.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595534},{"amount":159.12,"local_amount":489.59,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":516.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989796},{"amount":3.38,"local_amount":10.41,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210927}],"funded_date":"2009-02-14T10:18:49Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Carreon","image":90574}},{"id":92338,"name":"Meas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S. is 39 years and who resides in rural area of Kompong Tom Province, Cambodia.

Their desire is the progress of their family. For a year she has been selling shoes for both women and men. She sells the merchandise by going house to house in different areas of her town. She sells on credit or for cash, according to what she agrees on with her customers. It is very important to her to treat her customers well because that determines if they will buy from her again. Additionally, she likes getting to know the different places in her city, since before she worked she didn\u2019t go out of her house a lot and there are many beautiful places in her region that have amazed her. She has made good earnings with her business, and she also counts on the support of her husband, who helps her with sales when he is available, increasing her income. In the future Adela would like to have a shoe store exclusively for women because she considers this more profitable. This is her 6th loan with MFP and what she likes about her village bank is that they don\u2019t have problems and all of the members are very communicative and responsible.

Rahmatullo lives with his wife and two children. He has been a farmer since he was young because his parents also grew large amounts of crops. He is happy being a farmer and enjoys it very much and, following the example of his father, he plants and then his wife or son take the products to the market to sell.  Rahmatullo also raises and sells cattle. Farming gives Rahmatullo good earnings. He tells us that you only need to know how to take care of what you plant and to pay attention to what the crops need. As such, he fertilizes so that he has a good harvest. This is his second loan with Kiva partner IMON International and he is responsible with his payments. He plans to purchase high-quality seeds, mineral fertilizer and also young cattle. Rahmatullo is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his goals with this loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From the time he was young he was looking for a way to start his own business to be able to help his parents with family expenses. With much effort he initiated his own business with very little merchandise. Selling soft drinks and juices, little by little he was able to maintain his home and start to grow his business, incorporating the sale of grocery items too and improving the quality of service he offered. <P>\r\n\r\nSherzod needs a loan of 5000 Somoni, which he will use to provide more juices and soft drinks so he can continue to work hard to sustain his family. Sherzod very much appreciates your support.  <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a candy-making business. Her husband Agapito M., who is 38 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have four children who are between 3 and 14 years old, and all of them are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nMercy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 8,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $150, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, and snack  foods in the local community. Elias has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elias joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elias has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products sell. Elias is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory like snack foods and beverages. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Elias from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For this reason, Do\u00f1a Anacleta has turned to the Asociaci\u00f3n ASDIR to request a loan to purchase raw materials so that she can increase her weekly sales. With this loan, she hopes to help her children succeed and improve their quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Priya Bapat, Kiva

Nilo works the soil as a farmer, planting the same fields he grew up on, growing crops such as potatoes, peas and corn.\r\n\r\nWhen he doesn\u2019t have to work in his own fields, he works by taking his bulls to plow the fields of his neighbors and other family members. They pay him from 50 to 80 Soles for this work, depending on the size of the area plowed.\r\n\r\nKeeping his draft animals healthy and strong is a major preoccupation for Nilo, and he feeds them well every morning before taking them out to plow. He buys the corn stalks after each corn harvest as food for his animals.\r\n\r\nHe inherited his skill and strength for plowing from his father, a fact of which he is very proud. He also mentioned that knowing how to control the animals is critical \u2013 without that you can\u2019t plow.\r\n\r\nThis is the eighth loan request for Nilo with MFP; the previous loans have been repaid on time and in full, and Nino has shown to be a very reliable borrower.

She has two children, one of whom is already grown up and a professional, and the other who is studying at the university. She lives 25 minutes from the city of Cochabamba in a rural zone dedicated to agriculture, livestock and dairy products. Vitalia and her husband have been making a living in dairy products since they were married. They started with two heads of cattle and little by little grew their business. They are requesting the loan in order to finish construction on their home because the work had stopped due to a lack of funds. The loan would help them a great deal in improving their home and in turn also improving the quality of life for their family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Tursunoy is 46 years old. She is married with two children. Since 1999, Tursunoy has been engaged in bicycle spare parts sales. She has a shop in the local market. She sells spare parts of different types and for different bicycles. <P>\r\n\r\nAs a result of the success of her business, Tursunoy has improved the living conditions of her family and is doing her best to meet all the needs of her dearest children. But she is not satisfied with the volume of sales and wants to increase her inventory, thus increasing the volume of sales. With this purpose in mind, today Tursunoy requests 4500 Somoni that will be spent for purchasing spare parts for bicycles to increase her range of goods. With your help this will be possible. Be an important part of the growth of Tursunoy\u2019s business. <P> \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in her parents\u2019 house as they do not have their own home.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the communal bank for five years and the loans she has received have greatly assisted the development of her sewing studio. She will invest this loan in the purchase of a sewing machine, thread, and other necessary materials. Her dream is to one day have a store where she can sell all the items that she creates.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":578912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a sewing machine, thread, fabric, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-05T07:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Piedad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847055},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113511},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407186},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407187},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388264},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388265},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682790},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191421947}],"funded_date":"2010-08-05T12:20:03Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"k vickery","image":389145}},{"id":224306,"name":"Elizaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Elizaya S. is currently in the business of selling various raw foods such as cassava, yams, Irish potatoes, etc. at the market and is requesting a loan to stock maize flour and rice to sell.

She is 36 years old. Alma is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Alma owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorcycle or habal-habal(tax) services as her husband is the driver for local community members. Alma has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Alma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed for the maintenance of the service. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Alma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Malis, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   a general store, a livestock business and a fishing business .Her husband Reynaldo, who is 40 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living. They have four children who are 6 to 20 years old. Shirley joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Shirley has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for her general store so she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Shirley B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Compostela, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Welma is borrowing PHP 16,000 so that she can purchase a new tool for her business.   This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Welma aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference  in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

They live in large traditional families and are 36 years old on average and have at least 7 children.  For the most part, they raise peanuts.  With the intention of making their agricultural concerns profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso credit program four years ago.  After having fully repaid their 3 previous loans, they are on their fourth country loan.  Djelika, the first seated with a child in her lap, she expects to use her loan to buy a sufficient quantity of peanut seeds, some light equipment, and agricultural fertilizers at the big market in Kimparana.  After the rainy season, the harvests are stored for a certain amount of time so that they gain value before being sold at the big market in Kimparana and at surrounding markets at retail (or often wholesale) for cash to a customer base generally coming from the big cities.  The members of the group expect to each make a profit of 50,000 to 60,000 FCFA after the harvest of their agricultural products, which will be used to pay the interest on their loans and their families' current expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":789517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fertilizers, seeds and light equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Moribila Kafonon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Setou Oumar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Biba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Worokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Worokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maramou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":725000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1625,"local_amount":725000,"processed_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-17T08:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":733614.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424522}],"funded_date":"2011-07-05T20:32:07Z","paid_date":"2012-04-17T08:31:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Martha Schmitz","image":489893}},{"id":310365,"name":"Fresas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"     El grupo se llama \"Fresas\"  que se integra de tres se\u00f1oras cada una con diferente actividad y est\u00e1 ubicado en la lo calidad de Coapilla Estado de Chiapas.\n     Las se\u00f1ora quien se le tomo la  entrevista es la se\u00f1ora Candelaria, ella es casada con el se\u00f1or  Alfonzo y con quien procreo tres hijos que aun est\u00e1n a su responsabilidad y son: Mar\u00eda Adriana  de ocho a\u00f1os de edad, Sandra Guadalupe de cinco a\u00f1os de edad y el  m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o es  Luis Alfonso de un a\u00f1o de edad.\n     Ella se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de tamales y solcito el pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en la compra de ingredientes, como son: carne, masa, pasas, hoja de guineo,  entre otros,  y as\u00ed poder elaborar su actividad en donde lleva un a\u00f1o y dos  meses en donde comenta que le va bien ya que con ello ha tenido un buen resultado de ingreso en su hogar.\n    Comenz\u00f3 con esta actividad por su propia creatividad ya que  por un tiempo estuvo apoyando a una compa\u00f1era hacer tamales y vio que le dejaba ingresos, por eso ella decidi\u00f3 trabajar la misma actividad y nos platica que le va bien.\n     Su m\u00e1s grande deseo  es que con esta peque\u00f1a actividad pueda  tener sus propios ahorros y  con el pr\u00e9stamo lograr trabajar para salir adelante con su familia.\n     Las se\u00f1oras que integran en el grupo son: Consuelo, quien se dedica a la  compra i venta de marranos y la se\u00f1ora Isabel se dedica a la compra y venta de sandalias.","en":"The group is called \u201cFresas\u201d (Strawberries) and is composed of three women.

Thi Ly's family relied only on farming and raised a small number of livestock which took advantage of scrap food and side products of farming. Her family's economy at that point of time was only the average in Tan Trai village. In 1995, Mrs. Ly joined the TYM Fund and borrowed the first loan of 500,000VND (about 33USD), which she used to purchase a female pig to breed. It brought about a profit of more than 1,000,000VND (about 66USD). As a creative and active woman, Mrs. Ly had tried many businesses such as buying and selling general goods and opening an eatery in Phu Cuong market, which all yielded good profit. However, she realised that raising livestock in large scale would return higher profit. Therefore, she discussed with her husband and moved into raising a large number of livestock. Her subsequent loans were all large in amount, from 16,000,000VND to 19,000,000VND. She bought 25-30 pigs each time and each year she raised and bred them 3 times, gaining profit from 10 millions to 15 millions VND. Currently, she has 2 female pigs to breed and 30 pigs to sell, along with hundreds of chickens. Thus, her family's monthly income reaches 7 millions VND (about 466USD). This time, she would like to borrow 18 millions VND (1,100.00USD) to invest in raising livestock.\r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b> \r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc khi ch\u01b0a tham gia Q\u0169y T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng,  gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb L\u00fd ch\u1ec9 l\u00e0m n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p v\u00e0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i nh\u1ecf nh\u1eb1m t\u1eadn d\u1ee5ng th\u1ee9c \u0103n d\u01b0 th\u1eeba v\u00e0 c\u00e1c s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m ph\u1ee5 t\u1eeb n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p, kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb khi \u0111\u00f3 v\u00e0o lo\u1ea1i trung b\u00ecnh c\u1ee7a th\u00f4n T\u00e2n Tr\u1ea1i.

The profits will be invested in food, health care, and their work. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":520745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buying charcoal ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fougani ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soukoura       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":64308.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746602},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":64308.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779156},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":64308.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961358},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":64308.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699474}],"funded_date":"2010-04-08T04:09:01Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":195646,"name":"Ana  Joaquina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Joaquina T. es una se\u00f1ora de 22 a\u00f1os de edad la cual vive con su esposo en una comunidad llamada Santa Fe localizada en Los Chiles, provincia de Alajuela; est\u00e1 comunidad se destaca por ser una zona monta\u00f1osa y por estar muy cerca de la frontera norte de nuestro pa\u00eds.

Her husband Redempto V., who is 28 years old, works as a fisherman. They have one five-year-old child. Rubelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rubelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to purchase a fishing net and use as additional capital for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and improve the family's living conditions. Rubelyn V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The hard work that she does every day for her crops, mainly the plantains, results in her travelling twice a month to the cities of La Merced and Villa Rica, where she sells her products. But since she knows that the harvest for coffee is once a year, she wants to improve and increase the plantings of different products. In this way, she will ensure herself against financial problems. This is the first time that she has had a loan with MFP and she hopes that they can acheive their goals as an independent communal bank.

They have three children who live independently. Melania and Ignacio live together in their own house in Santa Rosa de Palomar in the district of San Luis de Shuaro, in the province of Chanchamayo. Melanie began working in the fields 30 years ago. In all this time she has learnt what she needs to know to successfully sell her produce (coffee and bananas). She sees her sacrifices pay-off when she sells her goods to the wholesalers, who visit the area all the time, and she makes a good profit. She also has the support of her husband, who sells fish to door-to-door in the town. And the goods that are sold in the market are a result of her labors in the field. Thanks to her hard work, she has been able to extend her house, adding more rooms for her children to stay in when they go to visit.

Her youngest daughter is still a schoolgirl.  In 2002, in search of a source of income for her family, Akyljan started her own animal husbandry business with a starting sum of 40,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her tenacity and perseverance, her farming business now brings about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of meat and dairy products.  In order to further expand her business, Akyljan has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to purchase additional head of cattle.

She is now a confident member, earning up to shsUG 150,000 per month from producing beads. She plans to build a family house at Pader where she can sleep when she visits her home district.\r\n<p>\r\nSylvia's quarrying business involves paying labor for the digging of the stones, cracking them to the desired sizes, and then loading them to the customers' trucks.

She has a business, Delicious, to make ice cream, which she distributes to nearby stores in her neighborhood, where it is sold quickly due to its pleasant flavor. \r\n\r\nShe decided to go into this business when she was 16, when she observed that there was not enough money in the home. She now has seven years in this activity and hopes to continue much longer. What Edith likes best about her work is that she can eat the ice cream she wants while preparing it, because she has to sample the flavor of her product. She thinks that in the future she could put a brand mark on her ice cream and so be able to compete in the Juliaca city market. The hard part is to bear the cold while preparing the ice cream, yet she is still ready to continue with this business, with the sole purpose of improving her life. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan she has with MFP. She has always been very punctual in her payments and expects to be punctual now also. She feels very comfortable in her community bank, and always gets advice from the other members.

He is married, lives in his own home, and is the father of 4 children who live elsewhere.  He has dedicated his entire life to agriculture and has the satisfaction of knowing that none of his crops have ever failed.  This was how he was able to provide his children with an education that enabled them to develop into good people, and not become financially dependent on him.  \r\n<p>\r\nFortunato, despite his age, has no intentions to quit farming.  To the contrary, he plans to keep on planting and harvesting his crops.  The thought that he may not be able to continue farming fills him with sadness and makes him physically ill.  He continues to plant potatoes, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulluco\" target=\"_blank\" >ulloco<\/a>, and peas.  His crops are sold at the wholesale market in Tarma, where buyers will pay between 40 to 60 soles per bag depending on the size and variety.

","en":"The Oriental Communal Bank is represented by Sra. Dalia and consists of 12 group members. Most of the group is currently in its third loan cycle and has been punctual in making previous loan payments. The group is responsible and united. They are very hard-working people, as can be seen at their stands, where they sell empanadas (meat pastries), cards, food and groceries. Some of the male group members work in passenger transport.\n\nThe group members are not very worried about competition in their respective fields; they just focus on working hard in order to get ahead through effort and dedication. Dalia is the group president, and has been selling cakes for the past 20 years. Yovanna has been selling cards for the past year, Juana has been selling empanadas for 2 years, Blanca Nieve has been working as a promoter for the past 3 years, Veronica has been working at her restaurant for the past 2 years, Francys has been working as a promoter for 2 years, Tomas is a taxi driver and has 9 years of experience, Maria Nelly has been selling empanadas for one year, Blanca has two years of experience selling prepared meals, Marithza has been selling empanadas for the past year, Erika has been selling empanadas for the past 2 years, and Mabel has 3 years of experience running her grocery store. \n\nMost of the group members will use this loan to buy more merchandise to sell: for example, the members who sell food in restaurants or on the street will buy ingredients to prepare their pastries. The male group members will re-upholster their vehicles and buy some replacement parts in order to better serve their clients and earn more income for their families. The group members want to be able to provide their children with a professional-level education and a more comfortable home, and so they will continue to work until their dreams become reality. \n<br

With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Recelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000 which she intends to use to buy more feeds and piglets so that she can continue to save up for future rolling capital and for the education of her children.

A. arrived in the city of Barranquilla 17 years ago  She had become a widow with three children and decided to seek a better life.  Initially she worked as a domestic worker for two years, during which time she perfected her way of preparing meals.  She therefore stopped this activity and joined with her current spouse who was devoted to her.  At first she sold servings of soup, and today's main activity is the sale of lunches on a daily basis to 35 construction workers.  She has added to this the sale of cheese fingers and cold drinks, especially beer, on the weekends, when she sells at least 30 cases.  She also offers cell phone services, an activity that provides additional income.  Her daughter supports her in this business, she is paid daily and is directly employed by the business.\r\n\r\nEna Luz is now the mother of 5 children aged between 6 to 21 years.  Three of them live in another town with their grandparents.  She dreams of them all achieving success and being able to study and become professionals.  Ena therefore directs all her efforts to make this happen through daily hard work, and she is supported in this by her husband who works as a janitor at a construction firm. \r\n\r\nThis is the first funding she has received from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy non-perishable products such as rice, oil, grain and beer at wholesale.  This is an investment that promises to be successful, not only because of the experience of the entrepreneur in these activities but also because the season is about to become more cheerful with fun in the city from The Carnival of Barranquilla, where \"everything is for sale\", especially those products Ena prepares for festivals and for the local celebrations that take place with families in their communities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":731094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They are her greatest treasure, and she wishes to help them with the various family expenses.  \r\n\r\nShe delivers newspapers, which is one of the most difficult jobs in the city.  People are on the streets very early wanting to stay informed of the latest events.  She distributes the papers to her customers at the optimal time whenever possible.  To achieve her sales record of these papers, she gets up at dawn to go the newspaper agencies to get papers to distribute to stores and stalls in the markets.\r\n\r\nHer routine is to distribute in the mornings and collect in the afternoons.  She has been doing this for 20 years.  In that time she has gained experience, and she has a great number of customers who are used to visits from Eusebia.\r\n\r\nHer next goal is to set up a stall in the regional market to sell food products as an additional business, which she is used to.\r\n\r\nShe needs help to have greater income in order to give her elderly parents security.  This is her seventh loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  She has shown herself to be a person who does well in making her payments.\r\n\r\nEusebia likes the enthusiasm her work team has.  It is one of the characteristics of the community bank, which has 16 members, that pleases her.  The 2,200 PEN that she is asking for is to buy more newspapers in order to increase customers in her region.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":379551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":365}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.11,"local_amount":367,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":370.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081280},{"amount":125.12,"local_amount":367,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":370.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997431},{"amount":125.11,"local_amount":367,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":370.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842776},{"amount":374.66,"local_amount":1099,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1108.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734353}],"funded_date":"2009-08-29T19:04:57Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":137509,"name":"Caracol Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cCaracol\u201d esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Gladis y conformado por 14 miembros los cuales can cursando su primer ciclo, en general los socios del grupo se dedican a actividades comerciales entre las que se pueden mencionar a la venta D. pan, gelatina, ropa, comida, empanadas y a actividades como la costura, alba\u00f1iler\u00eda, enfermer\u00eda y al servicio D. transporte p\u00fablico.

Inauawan, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling food, running  a general store and raising pigs. Her husband Danilo, who is 48 years old, works as a delivery truck driver and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children between seven and 23. \r\n\r\nAdamia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adamia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use for the maintenance of her general store and as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and their daily needs. Adamia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

","en":"Beatriz is a very hardworking 32-year-old woman. She has had a grocery store in her house for 10 years. She first began renting a store from her sister-in-law, but the rent became very expensive and she had to step renting and opted instead to put the business in her home. She says that she asked for a loan to supply her store and buy bleach, canned chili peppers, soups, oil, soap, eggs, beans, sodas, candies, milk, etc. Bety, as she is known by her friends, goes to different stores in Zitacuaro to source her products where they give her good prices so that she can make a profit when she sells them. \r\n\r\nBeatriz is married to Juan Carolos, who is a Guaracha musician, and has two children - Cecilia, who is in primary school, and Carlos, who is 2. Bety is thankful for the loan because this way she will be able to have more stock in her store. Her goal is to buy more shelves to accommodate her products and later to buy a refrigerator to stock cold meats.
