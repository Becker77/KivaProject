Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nLala works at a local hotel as an administrator, and her mother works as a housekeeper. They both get a small monthly income. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRecently, Lala requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit, with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit Lala will trade in clothing. She plans to purchase clothing from the wholesalers and then resell at higher prices among the neighbors. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

The family lives in their own house which is made of wood.  For 20 years, Victor has been growing organic cocoa on land that is located an hour from his home.  Thanks to the jungle climate it is possible to grow good quality cocoa beans, and so this is a good business alternative for the producers in the area.  \r\n\r\nAt this time, Victor wants to invest in grafted cocoa, and for that he needs to hire day laborers who know the technique in order to perform this task as quickly as possible.

As this is his first Kiva loan, he is thankful for the opportunity that he is being provided, and he promises to make his payments on time.  \r\n\r\nWith this 4,000 Peruvian soles he requests, he will buy organic fertilizer for his crops, and he will also hire local workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1324748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic fertilizer and hire local workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-03T21:30:31Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-03T21:30:31Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":430.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":464.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":472.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":489.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":509.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":525.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":546.03},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":561.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.83,"local_amount":430.54,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":432.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578102},{"amount":179.85,"local_amount":464.11,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":465.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530330},{"amount":183.06,"local_amount":472.43,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":474.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975358},{"amount":191.26,"local_amount":493.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":495.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996627},{"amount":198.58,"local_amount":512.47,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":514.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864108},{"amount":202.44,"local_amount":522.43,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":524.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352451},{"amount":214.93,"local_amount":554.66,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":556.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904303},{"amount":213.05,"local_amount":549.79,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":552,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090400}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T18:17:31Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":544218,"name":"Fortunata","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia se sigue dedicando al negocio de crianza de cuyes,la socia los hece engordar y crecer y luego los vende en las diferentes ferias,la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 5:00 p.m,la socia ya tiene 7 a\u00f1os en este negocio y le va muy bien,el sue\u00f1o de la socia es tener un local donde puead vender los cuyes.La socia solicita el credito para comprar cuyes y alimentos para cuyes.\n\n\nLa  socia agradece el apoyo que se le otorgara y as\u00ed mismo se compromete a cumplir de manera disciplinada con los pagos de las cuotas.\n","en":"Fortunata continues to make a living in raising guinea bigs.

Mongolia. The family resides on a plot of land in their own house which was built with loan funds. Davaajav's wife has been sewing deel (a Mongolian traditional costume) at home for 14 years. His second son lives on his own, and his youngest son now studies at university. Davaajav himself has been running a transportation business using his own truck since 2008 and accumulated vast amounts of experience. He is requesting a loan of 5500000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as fiberglass, cotton, foam, bricks and planks. During this period of time, the price of building and insulation materials reaches its lowest level and buying them now will save him a considerable amount of money. Using those building and insulation materials, he will build his own house which will enable the family to burn less coal in comparison with a Mongolian traditional ger (portable felt dwelling). During winter times, especially last winter, family members are chilled to their core due to strong snow storms blowing walls and frost forming between felt layers of their ger. So, building a house is the best way of staying warm during the cold winter and, more importantly, of reducing coal usage to contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3950,"image":{"id":1325031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Fortunato has dedicated the past 30 years of his life to organic cacao farming. Before settling into cacao farming, he raised and bred cattle, though it was challenging to locate and return cows to his herd that had strayed out of the pasture. \r\n\r\nAs one of the pioneers of organic fertilizer and manure in his area, Fortunato has been quite pleased with the healthy results it yields in conjunction with his experienced farming techniques. He hopes that an increasing number of farmers will switch to organic manure and fertilizers in the near future. As he expands his farming operation, he requires more fertilizer for tending his cacao trees and producing a high-quality harvest. One of his long term goals is to open a small grocery store in the city center where his wife could work to generate additional income for their family.  This is his first loan, and he promises to make all scheduled repayments on time.

Just for a suitable shelter, it is going to cost USD 1,500. This loan will help prevent her family from paying a higher rent for a room and will improve their standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1306772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

The interior walls and windows have became so fragile they do not protect the family from incoming storms and frosts. Therefore, she is requesting a loan of 5,700,000 MNT in order to purchase building and insulation materials such as fiberglass, cotton, foam, bricks, cement and planks. Using these materials, she can make an extension to her house and insulate the interior walls and windows. As a result, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal and contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

They scavenge for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials.  They sell these to junk shops like Joey\u2019s for a little profit.  Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries such as factories.  His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\n\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, he is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan.

She presently lives with just her husband in the home that they bought 40 years ago.\r\n\r\nSince she was young, she learned to work in the field. She says that at an early age she started her family, so she had to begin working in the harvest of potato, corn, beans, and the other plants typical of the area. She inherited the extensive area of agricultural land that she possesses from her parents. It is in this way that in each harvest she sells her produce in the market of her locality, since she is known for growing organic corn. Now she wants to improve her income, as her main difficulty in negotiating her harvests is language since she speaks Quechua. This is her first loan with Kiva; she is grateful for the opportunity that they're offering her since she will be able to improve her business. For this reason, she promises to be timely with her installment payments.

She lives in a thatched-roof house, with her family, including five children. Out of her five children, she needs to support only three. Two of the dependent children are still in school, while the remaining one is still too young for schooling. Lim does her rice cropping business on a two-hectare area, which she has been working for 13 years. This work earns her about 23,600 KHR per day.\r\n\r\nThis is the third microloan for Lim and her co-borrower in the same group of two, with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She feels confident that she can move her family\u2019s living status toward an upward trend, better than before.

The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repairs.  During the winter time, the family chills down to their core so they decided to make an extension to the house in order to reduce heat loss.  In order to make the extension, she needs 1,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, bricks and cement.  As a result, the family will burn less coal thus contributing to the effort to reduce air pollution.

She has repaid back her past loans with success which were used to increase yield for her rice and increase her income. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy fertilizer for her cash-crops.

He lives in a small village near the Gardabani District with his wife and five children. Vano has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but has had no success. His loan requests were always rejected, due to his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is trading. In particular, Vano purchases iron at wholesale prices and then resells at a higher price. However, it is hardly enough to pay for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nVano requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved within the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit Vano will purchase a milking cow so the family can produce dairy products to sell. This will increase the family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of Vano's family.

She lives in the small village of the Sachkhere district with husband and two sons. \r\n\r\nManana has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nManana\u2019s husband and son are working as truck drivers and get a small monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nManana requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as high risk borrowers because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Manana will purchase a milking cow and sheep. After purchasing the livestock, Manana will be able to produce dairy products for selling. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1325135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a milking cow and sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Chorvila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-04T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-04T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":93.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":102.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":108.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":112.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":114.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":117.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":121.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":124.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":128.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":131.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":134.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":138.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.53,"local_amount":82.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":83.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570439},{"amount":47.84,"local_amount":78.44,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":79.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969106},{"amount":47.86,"local_amount":78.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":79.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749525},{"amount":1378.77,"local_amount":2260.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613433}],"funded_date":"2013-04-10T19:18:50Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:16:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":544423,"name":"Chan Sultan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chan Sultan is a 52 years old hardworking women living with her husband and five children in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

She would now like to buy a place in a commercial area so she can sell her legumes at a good price and grow into a wholesale entrepreneur. \"That is my goal, which I hope to accomplish with the support of my husband and my family, especially because my children are young and they will need us,\" she says.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva. She promises to be punctual with her payments, as she is grateful for the financial support which will allow her to improve her fields. Ayde will invest these 2,000 Peruvian soles in the purchase of organic fertilizer to nourish her crops, because soon she will harvest the legumes and corn."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1324841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-04T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-04T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":213.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":232.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":236.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":245.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":255.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":263.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":273.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":280.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2008.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578111}],"funded_date":"2013-04-04T21:04:37Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":544461,"name":"Eric","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eric is 28 years old, married, and has two children, one of whom attends school.

He lives in the small village of Telavi District with his wife, two-year-old son, and parents. Several times, Aleksi requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard. They produce wine and sell it locally. In addition, his mother works as a cook and gets a small, monthly income. It is hardly enough money for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nAleksi requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Aleksi will purchase a minibus. After purchasing the minibus, Aleksi will begin trading in livestock. He plans to purchase the livestock at wholesale prices and then resell it to his villagers with the price marked up. This will increase the income of the family.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGogi requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business.

One day, when I was 12, I came upon a carpentry shop where I discovered my vocation for working with wood and leather.

Using a rent-to-own approach gives her customers access to solar lighting without having to worry about the upfront costs. The customer pays back the amount of money they would normally spend on kerosene each night and once the rent-to-own term is finished, not only do they have a cleaner, healthier source of lighting but they also reduce their energy costs.

","en":"Mirsaid always wanted to be a wealthy businessman, as he is educated to be a mathematics teacher and teaches at high school. Mirsaid is a married man and he has raised four children. The children are adults. His wife works as a nurse at a rural hospital. She is a very good woman and tries to help her husband in all cases. \r\n\r\nSo, 16 years ago, Mirsaid started his business of livestock breeding and agriculture and very successfully runs his business.

She had a great childhood with her mother and her father. She remembers that they spent a lot of time with their family.  They used to do family activities on the weekends.  At the age of 7, her younger brother was born. He was her playmate with toys, pranks, and offices of the house. Although she admits they have their differences and sometimes fight, they have a good relationship. Of course it is natural that they have distinct personalities and characteristics. In regards to their parents, they have been separated for 12 years.  Since then she has only lived with her mother and her brother. Until now, her mother was responsible for all the household expenses. For this reason she feels that it is important to emphasize that she has had a lot of influence on her method of thinking and interpretation of the world.  Her mother taught that to reach her objectives she needs to work hard for them and she needs to have a lot of responsibility, commitment, love and especially strength. She should not be discouraged when there are difficulties even if they are very challenging because they might not be as hard to achieve them if they are worth pursing.  On the other hand since her father has difficultly contributing to their financial income, he has always been worried about the well being of the family.  Her father is loving and understanding. He has always impressing on them the importance on studying and to get trained in their area of interest and passion.  So they can worth with love and dedication, he always says \u201cstudying is the only commodity that no one can take away.\u201d This is something that has always contributed to Paoloa\u2019s academic pursuit. \r\n\r\nShe has completed her elementary and junior high school studies in the \u201cColegio Campestre Maximino Poitiers\u201d (Rural School Maximino Poitiers). There she met nice people that are not valuable friends. From these friendships she has also learned many positive qualities such as being a happy, non-pretentious, and cooperating person.  For her every person that she is allowed to meet in depth is a learning gift. \r\n\r\nThe school stage was one of the best experiences that she has had, but this ended on November 30, 2011.  After she graduated she was certain that she wanted to go to the University of Distrital Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas. Fortunately, she was admitted. Soon the time came for her to start school where she studied Humanities and Castillian language. She enthusiastically started her studies, but unfortunately as time passed by she realized she did not feel satisfied with the subject she was studying. Even though she didn\u2019t feel connected with her studies, she knew that her only responsibility was to continue studying even though she did not like her career. She still gave the best of herself. When she finished the first semester she had good grades. Her grades were so good that she received tuition remission for the second semester, but she was meditating and questioning if this was her true passion. She was looking ahead for a few years and she did not consider herself working in this profession. After giving it serious consideration, she decided to speak with her parents to let them know that she was not satisfied with her chosen profession and she thought it was prudent to switch majors. At the beginning her parents opposed her decision, which made her doubt, but firmly and with a lot of respect she told them. \u201cIf you want me to continue in this major simply because you like it, wouldn\u2019t you think it is unfair and that when I work on my career I would do it with frustration?\u201d  Thank God they let their guard down and supported her decision. At that point she questioned what she would really like to study and where could she study. Then she decided to study cooking in Campoalto for that year to study in Campoalto in August. \r\n\r\nShe is taking her second semester and as a side activity she does in home manicures, she sells cleaning supplies, she builds key chains for a company that is promoting their product, she takes her cousin to kindergarten, in these ways she obtains the financial sources to do her culinary work and have money for her tuition. Sometimes she can not afford all of her expenses and occasionally her parents help her financially. \r\n\r\nShe wants to finish her studies and begin working. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finish her culinary academic program in Campoalto","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197689},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891011},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912425}],"funded_date":"2013-04-05T01:46:15Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alana Abbitt-McGregor","image":1119620}},{"id":544676,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is a 60-year-old woman who runs a store to support her family.

However, because of her family circumstances, she did not have the opportunity to go to university, so she has no higher education.\r\n\r\nAfter getting married, Dilorom started to experience financial problems.  Her husband is a simple worker and his small income is not enough to provide for two children.  She therefore wants to start her own business so that she can find an additional source of income for her family.  She was very excited to learn about the course entitled \"Achieving Successs\", organized by the Association of Business Women.  She took part in this course and learned a lot of new information related to starting a new business.\r\n\r\nDilorom now wants to start buying and selling food products, since this type of goods is in high demand.  She lives in a rural setting where the competition is low.  Her mother-in-law will also be helping her with the business.\r\n\r\nDilorom is requesting a loan of $2,000 for the purchase of food products.

She lives in her own home along with her husband, who makes a living selling fresh pork and its derivatives, and their children, who are in elementary school. Eyra Elizabeth is a member of Las Flores loan group, and she makes a living making and selling corn tortillas. She makes between 200 and 250 tortillas a day and sells them herself out of her home to a regular customer base consisting of her neighbors. She works from 6 a.m. until 10 a.m. every day, since tortillas are eaten on a daily basis. This is the main source of income for her family, and she assumes part of the household expenses, such as her children's education. She has dedicated herself to the tortilla business for 12 years, and she also makes other traditional foods like tamales, which she only makes on the weekends and are in high demand because of their great taste. A young member of this group is Elizabeth Del Socorro, who also makes and sells corn tortillas out of her home. The other member of the group is Ivania, who makes fruit ice creams, popsicles, and a banana ice cream dish covered with chocolate that is called choco banano. The three are requesting a loan to expand their businesses by purchasing more supplies and in this way increase their production and, in turn, their sales, since they have sufficient demand. In this way they will increase their income and the quality of life for their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1321085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies like corn and firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T03:10:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eyra Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisabeth Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivania De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":927.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1007.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1031.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1056.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1081.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1107.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1134.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1152.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.19,"local_amount":927.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:54:31Z","rounded_local_amount":942.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364494260},{"amount":41.49,"local_amount":1007.74,"processed_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364494261},{"amount":42.49,"local_amount":1031.86,"processed_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115584},{"amount":43.51,"local_amount":1056.56,"processed_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:20:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1073.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115585},{"amount":44.54,"local_amount":1081.85,"processed_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675237},{"amount":45.62,"local_amount":1107.75,"processed_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1125.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675238},{"amount":46.7,"local_amount":1134.26,"processed_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1152.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539517},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":1152.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:34:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1171.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539518}],"funded_date":"2013-04-06T10:24:37Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:34:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":544609,"name":"Eulalio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eulalio un hombre humilde con gran visi\u00f3n de trabajo toda estas buenas cualidades caracterizan a este var\u00f3n originario de la bella Ciudad Dar\u00edo ubicada en la parte norte de Nicaragua.

Three of the children are in different grades of elementary school, and the youngest only went until the sixth grade before helping the family grow coffee. Mar\u00eda went to school for a year but didn't complete it because of a lack of economic resources for her parents, who were poor. It was them who taught her how to work off the land since she was very young, and this activity has been the only source of income for the family. She has never stopped working, and now she has done the activity alongside her husband for more than eight years. She sells her products to agents who come to the area to make their purchases, and the land that they work on is their own thanks to an inheritance left by her in-laws for her husband. The land is located 500 meters from their home, and she and her husband walk there daily. She is requesting the loan to purchase fertilizers, manure and other products to keep her crops free of plagues and diseases. Her dream is to expand her crops so she can earn more income to help her children with their education, so that they have a better quality of life and can be prepared to go to college so they can go through life with the benefit of a degree."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1325425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer and manure for her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T03:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T03:20:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15191.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118029}],"funded_date":"2013-04-06T04:37:49Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T10:40:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":544665,"name":"Anna Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anna Marie is 27 years old, married, and has two children.

","en":"Ozodjon lives in a village located not far from an urban center.  He works in his village, repairing passenger cars.  He does not have any specialized education, but learned his trade from an instructor who happened to be a neighbor.  Ozodjon has always had an interest in cars: in the beginning, he just helped his neighbor, but then he was drawn into the business.  He has been working with his neighbor\/instructor for many years.   The two of them rented a commercial space to fix passenger cars.\r\n\r\nOzodjon already has his own apprentices and he is happy to teach them his trade.  In the future, he is planning to open his own shop, where he would provide all car repair services.\r\n\r\nOzodjon is married and has a family.

is a caring, sympathetic, friendly and sensible person who always strives to do things well.  He is blessed with skills and good qualities, although he obviously has some failings like all human beings.  He currently lives with his family and is in his second term studying for a nursing auxiliary qualification with Campoalto institute.  He chose this course because he likes helping people in need and also because his mother and one of his aunts are nurses and, as he says, \"I like the work that they do\".   He believes that the course he is currently following will be very useful to him in his life and will help him to develop activities which allow him to test his knowledge in the service of the community.
