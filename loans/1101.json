sales at CampoAlto. She has always wanted to succeed and to be someone in her life, so she started to work at the age of 15 in a family home, where they knew her mother and gave her the opportunity to work from 3pm to 7pm. She really stood out and they recommended her to their relatives, who also offered her work in the mornings. They were very good people, and thanks to them she was able to save up for a year and a half so that she could take on a technical degree.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, she decided to change jobs because she started studying and she could no longer comply with her work schedule, so she sold chorizo in butcher's shops and restaurants. She has always liked being independent and obtaining her own things, even though her family has supported her as much as they could and they have always wanted her to have more opportunities than they had.\r\n\r\nShe wants to finish her program at CampoAlto so that she can obtain a better job position in order to continue studying and finish her professional degree in marketing and advertising. This will allow her to help her younger sister, so that she can study a university degree when she finishes high school and dedicate herself solely to her studies.\r\n\r\nShe has also thought about opening her own lingerie store in the future, where she will be able to apply all of the knowledge which she has acquired and to create employment for at least one person. She would also like to learn languages and thus have the opportunity to travel to other countries, perhaps finding a job and obtaining a better quality of life for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1325505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finish her CampoAlto program in Marketing and Sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T11:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T11:50:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeimy Catherin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":375000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":136533.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197698},{"amount":75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-07T10:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":136533.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891020},{"amount":75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":136533.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912434}],"funded_date":"2013-04-05T12:59:35Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":544704,"name":"Bichiko","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bichiko is 59 years old.

He lives in a small village in the Marneuli District with his wife, two sons and a daughter-in-law. Khudaverdi requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business startup, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have 0.3 hectares of agricultural land where potatoes are grown. They sell the harvested potatoes at local markets. Kudaverdi\u2019s son, Akhmed, has rented a workshop and works as an artisan of cars. It is hardly enough to pay for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKhudaverdi requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Khudaverdi will purchase a workshop where his son will get orders to repair cars. He wouldn\u2019t have to pay rent, and this will increase the income of the family.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

With the received credit, George will purchase a digital camera. He will go on the weddings as an photographer, take pictures and edit them. George is very talented in taking pictures and people in his district know about it, so he will have many clients.

He lives in Chokhatauri district with his 32 year-old wife, his retired parents, and two children who are going to school.  Besik requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nBesik has a mini-bus. He works on the village bus line and transports local people. His monthly income is very small and not enough to feed the family.\r\nBesik requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan programs envisage the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor.  These people do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Besik wants to open a car service center. He will purchase all the needed equipment and will do the work himself, as he is very experienced in this field. He is also well known among his villagers and will have a good number of clients. This will give him a good profit. He will reinvest part of the profit to develop his business, and another part will be used for covering family monthly expenses. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He has a plot of agricultural land where different kinds of fruits and vegetables are grown. He sells the harvested products at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGela requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Gela will start up a business selling clothing and bed-clothing.

He is twenty years old and comes from a humble, rural family. His story was written alongside his mom and his grandma; he never knew a dad, but his grandfather was always there supporting him. He is the oldest of six siblings. His mother worked very hard to give him an education. He always had dreams when he was little; like any boy who is beginning to dream of being a grown-up and accomplishing things, that's how he was. As he continued to grow, he still held on to his dreams. After a while, he started looking for a job; one day he was going to do an interview when something unexpected happened and he was taken in to the army. In the beginning it was hard on him because there was still that part of him that needed his mom, but he stuck with it anyway. Even now that he is not with her, he feels like he needs to keep striving for her sake, to provide for her\u2014not only materially, but also to give her the joy of a mother whose son is getting ahead\u2014and to always give her his support. Even though he is far away from that warmth, he has never felt like he was out in the cold; it just gives him more reason to keep fighting and thinking of his future.\r\n\r\nIt was approximately three years ago that he arrived in the city, his dreams still intact; actually he no longer saw them as dreams, but rather as a goal that he had to work hard to achieve: to be a great chef. And right then, he set out on what is his life plan. Never limiting himself to just one thing, he also studies many other things, like being a DJ. He has liked music since he was little, and that way, he can have his own restaurant and bar.\r\n\r\nSo he started working to pay for his own education since he didn't have any financial help from his family; he does want to help them, and to thank his grandma and his mom for all the love they gave him, for all that they taught him: in order to live, you need to dream, and in order to dream, you need to have a clear vision. And that's what he wants, to be great (it might not be much to some people, but in his life, it would be great): to be a professional, and for his life's plan not to remain wishful thinking, but rather for his effort to pay off a little more every day. A boy's dreams should never end, in spite of setbacks, because the most beautiful thing in life is to finally reach one's biggest goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to complete his culinary education program at CampoAlto.

He lives in Ikalto village,Telavi district, with his 37 year-old wife, Natia, and retired parents. Archil requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nThe family has a vineyard and a small plot of agricultural land. They grow grapes and different kinds of vegetables. Harvested products are sold locally at the markets. Archil also has a car. He is working on private orders and transports different kinds of cargo to bring additional income to the family.\r\nArchil requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor.  These people do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Archil will purchase two damaged cars. He will dismantle them for parts and will start selling them separately. As car parts are highly requested in his area, Archil will make a good profit from his new business. Increased income will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1325820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To purchase two damaged cars and sell the parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ikalto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T15:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T15:30:07Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Archil ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":240}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969117},{"amount":160,"local_amount":160,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749536},{"amount":160,"local_amount":160,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613443},{"amount":160,"local_amount":160,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857160},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133813},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107403},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254959},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019116},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670265},{"amount":160,"local_amount":160,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459140920},{"amount":180,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467956691},{"amount":240,"local_amount":240,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":240,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479177454}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T14:21:46Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T13:02:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":544775,"name":"Rosie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosie works hard to support her family.

This loan is his first sequence in the institution.  Abraham will use this loan to buy a dairy cow; he wants to take advantage of this opportunity.  The reason for requesting the loan is that he lacks the money for said purchase that will be very beneficial because good quality milk will be produced so he can make more cheese and milk to improve his income.

She lives in the Akhaltsikhe district with her 29-year-old husband, mother in-law and two children who are 10 years and 6 months old respectively. Nino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, without any success. Her loan request was rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\nNino sells perfumes. She is buying products at wholesale prices from the capital city, bringing it to her village and selling it among the locals at an increased price. Her husband is an artisan. He works on private orders and gets a small monthly salary. The total family income is not enough to cover their monthly expenses.\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Nino will purchase stock of perfumes. With the increased stock she will not have to go to the capital city so often. Also she will be able to offer a better choice of products to her clients. This will decrease her expenses and increase her income.

cuantos a\u00f1itos tenia, pero siempre fue muy compa\u00f1erita, ten\u00eda muchos amiguitos y le gustaba mucho la ensalada de repollo con zanahoria y pi\u00f1a, se acuerdo mucho q le dec\u00eda a su  mama q la llevara al jard\u00edn por q le gustaba la ensalada de zanahoria.\nLuego en la escuela, la verdad no ha sido muy buena para el estudio, pero le gustaba mucho todo lo que ten\u00eda que ver con los deportes y el baile, jugaba baloncesto y con el tiempo aprendi\u00f3 a jugar voleibol, algunas veces jugaban con los compa\u00f1eritos futbol.\nEn danzas se destaco bastante puesto que le gustaba estar bailando a toda hora y aparte de todo en los descansos colocaban grabadora con buena m\u00fasica para cantar y bailar un rato.\nEn cuanto a los compa\u00f1eros: siempre hay un ni\u00f1o bonito o el simp\u00e1tico, una ni\u00f1a q es la fe\u00edta, la charlatana, el consentido, la ni\u00f1a bonita y los dem\u00e1s. Ella era de los charlatanes, no la rega\u00f1aban todo el tiempo pero si de vez en cuando le daban quejas a la mami que  charlaba mucho en clase pero las notas bien.\nEn el bachillerato la verdad no le fue muy bien, c\u00f3mo era la consentida de papa, pues se podr\u00e1n imaginar pasar de una escuelita a un colegio fue tenaz para ella, le dio muy duro, lloraba bastante y se la montaron por llorona. Perdi\u00f3 octavo y la sacaron del colegio en donde estaba, la llevaron a otro y ese era femenino pues all\u00e1 la cosa no era muy diferente por que igual lloro cuando la dejaron sola en ese sitio.\nBueno,  en las practicas  que ten\u00edan que hacer un grupo de compa\u00f1eras y ella dictaron un cursos de danzas a los alumnos de un colegio, al principio fue algo complicado porque les toco desde los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os, hasta los m\u00e1s grandes, se acuerda mucho que le ense\u00f1aron a bailar el mapale, un baile llamado las vueltas, joropo, sanjuanero , cumbia y no otros que no recuerda, ha aparte de eso estuvo en  una velada cultural y ellas bailaron el jarabe tapat\u00edo con unas faldas hermosas que las hac\u00edan lucir divinas.\nLuego termino 11 y la se dedico a trabajar y nada m\u00e1s.\nHasta este a\u00f1o que tomo la decisi\u00f3n de retomar los estudios y como le gusta  la cocina, considera q lo hace bien y le gustar\u00eda aprender m\u00e1s de las personas q saben c\u00f3mo los maestros. \nAunque su papa no est\u00e1 vivo sabe que le hubiera gustado verla en este momento, haciendo lo que le gusta y lo que a \u00e9l le gustaba. Gracias a su mama y hermanos q la apoyan en este proceso espera llegar a montar su casa de banquetes o un buen restaurante \nGracias a ustedes \n","en":"The story begins with her entering Kindergarten although she doesn\u2019t remember exactly how old she was then but she was always a very good fellow student; she had lots of friends and liked cabbage, carrot and pineapple salad very much.  She remembers asking her mother to take her to kindergarten because of how much she liked the carrot salad.\r\n\r\nLater in school the truth is that she wasn\u2019t very good at studying but liked everything to do with dancing and sports; she played basketball and in time learned how to play volleyball; sometimes she even played soccer with her male classmates.\r\n\r\nShe stood out quite a bit in dance because she liked to dance at all times and besides that during recess they\u2019d set up a tape player with good music to sing and dance for a while.\r\n\r\nAs for her little classmates, there\u2019s always the cute or pleasant little boy, or the little girl that\u2019s not too good-looking, the talkative one, the teacher\u2019s pet, the pretty girl and all the others.  She was one of the chatty ones.  They didn\u2019t always scold her for this but sometimes did send reprimands home to her mother because she chatted too much during class; her grades were good however.\r\n\r\nIn secondary school she didn\u2019t do too well but she was her father\u2019s favorite.   You can well imagine that going from a little elementary school to a secondary school was quite a shock for her; it hit her hard.  She cried quite a bit and they punished her for being a crybaby.  She failed 8th grade and they took her out of the school she was attending and transferred her to another one.  Even though that one was all girls that didn\u2019t change things for her because she cried there too when she was left alone there.\r\n\r\nSo, for the practical courses they had to do, she and a group of fellow students taught dance classes to students in a school.  At first it was a bit complicated because they got from the smallest to the biggest ones and she remembers that they taught them to dance the \u2018mapale,\u2019 and dances called \u2018las vueltas,\u2019 \u2018joropo,\u2019 \u2018sanjuanero,\u2019 \u2018cumbia,\u2019 and others she does not remember.  In addition to that she participated in a cultural evening where she danced the \u2018jarabe tapat\u00edo\u2019 wearing beautiful skirts that made her feel fabulous.  \r\n\r\nWhen she completed 11th grade she decided to go to work and that was all until she decided this year to return to school and since she likes to cook she thinks she\u2019ll do it well and would like to learn more from people, like the teachers, who know more.\r\n\r\nAlthough her father is no longer living she knows that he would have liked to see her at this moment doing what she likes and what he enjoyed too.  Thanks to her mother and siblings who support her in this process she hopes to reach her goal of establishing a banquet hall or a good restaurant thanks to you.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to complete her chef's course.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joanna Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197701},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-07T10:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891023},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912435}],"funded_date":"2013-04-05T18:02:56Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":544819,"name":"Tete","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tete is 51 years old.

His business has been profitable because people in his district generally do not have the money for a new car. Natig believes that his business is going well because of the quality, good prices, and friendly treatment he offers his customers.\r\n\r\nNatiq lives with his wife and their two school-aged children.\r\n\r\nHe has applied for a loan in the amount of 1500 AZN.

is 40 years old. He is married and has three children. \r\n\r\nRavshan is a person who always falls in a story. Twenty years ago, he went to his friend\u2019s house and saw a big cow which nearly knocked him over with his horns. Ravshan was frightened and overwhelmed. Returning to his home, he decided to get money through the animal that scared him. In this way, he began his own business with animal husbandry. Now, he is one of the best and most successful businessmen in the local market. He buys cows, cares for them for two or three months, and sells them to local people. Thanks to his efforts, his cows are fat and attract a lot of customers. \r\n\r\nRavshan wants to buy more cows to develop his business, but he does not have enough money for it.

So Sargis needs a 600,000 Armenian Drams loan, which he will use to buy potatoes, apples, cucumbers, tomatoes and pears, for his newly-created food trading.

He lives in his mother-in-law's house, in a small room with adobe walls and a dirt floor.  The house if located in Concepcion, which is in the southern part of the city of La Paz.  Currently, Carlos works (in transportation) more than 10 hours a day, often late into the night.  He works these hours because he has to cover the cost of food and the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe needs this loan to pay for the cost of maintaining his vehicle, since it is the only source of income to sustain his family.  Carlos' dream is to improve his income so he can obtain housing via anticretico.

condition and he needs to repair his house as soon as possible. He is a very kind and hardworking person. Majid is married and has 3 children, all daughters. He teaches at the high school and his parents are always asking him to fix the house. But the income they get for growing such crops as cucumbers and garlic, and for raising livestock is too little for this. He has to replace the windows and doors, which don't insulate the house during winter -- and winter in Tadzikistan is quite cold.

Thanks to God, she never lacked food, and she always had good communication with her family.  Her mother was her best friend, although she was not able to spend a lot of time with her.\r\n\r\nHer father visited them when he could, and always took care to be a great father and to help his daughters and his wife.\r\n\r\nWhen Ingrit was in 6th grade, her father died of a heart attack.  This was a blow to all of them.  From this point on, things became more difficult.  Her mother had to take charge of all of the household expenses.\r\n\r\nSometime later, the family was able to buy a nice house.  This helped them a lot, because the expenses decreased.  In 10th grade, Ingrit took the opportunity to get a technical degree from SENA (a public vocational education program).  In this program, she developed skills in working with machines to make coats and jackets.  She successfully completed this program along with her high school degree.\r\n\r\nWhen Ingrit left school, she had  no means to further her education, so she enrolled in a SENA program to learn how to make underwear.  She finished this program and also successfully completed an internship.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of her training, Ingrit started working making bathing suits and underwear.  Someone wanted to work in her studio, and so she gave notice that she would study at CAMPOALTO (a technical college).\r\n\r\nNow Ingrit is studying hotel management, putting in maximum effort on her part, because her mother is paying for her tuition.  Her goals include finishing her professional degree, being able to work satisfactorily in her field, and achieving economic stability.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to complete her studies in kitchen management in the hotel management program of CAMPOALTO","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-05T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-05T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ingrit Tatiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197690},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-09T10:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891012},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912426}],"funded_date":"2013-04-05T21:42:44Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":544841,"name":"Loucine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loucine is a 28-year-old Lebanese single woman living with her parents and one sibling.

With her loan she plans on buying two cows that are well-suited for milk production and have had at least one calf.  This will make sure that they give a good amount of milk every day.  Her idea is to take advantage of the grassy space that she has and the good condition of the land and also the good climate so as to be able to have these animals and also get milk from them.  She also hopes to raise the male calves for meat and the females for milk (if they have the traits needed for milk cows).\r\n\r\nWith this purchase, she will be able to develop her business activity and at the same time save some money that will allow her to have more animals and invest more in her property.  This is the first loan that she has received from Fudecosur.

He lives in Chechela village, Adigeni district, with his 47-year-old wife, Nana. Valodia requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe main source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. They own a plot of land, where they grow potatoes. The family also has four milking cows, a calf, and eight sheep. They milk the cows to make dairy products, and from the sheep they get wool and also cheese. Harvested potatoes, with the dairy products, are sold locally at the market.\r\n\r\nRecently, Valodia requested a loan from Credo to restart a family business. His loan request was approved, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Valodia wants to start trading in household goods and clothes. He and his wife had a business like this, a few years ago. Because they are already experienced in this field, Valodia decided to restart the business. The loan will be used for purchasing a stock of household goods and clothes at the wholesale price, which will be distributed at the local markets.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

children. A fish monger since 1996, Jane managed to acquire several plots of land in Kyotera and now has some rental housing in Kinankole zone that provides a secondary source of income for her family.<p>\r\n\r\nJane began selling fish because Kyotera is located near the shore of Lake Kijjanabalora, which has high quality tilapia fish.

She is a young mother to two small children, who are her reason for living and for moving ahead. She is part of the \"Buenas Amistad\" (\"Good Friendship\") group, which is made up of five members.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs.

She has a daughter named Juliana, 5, who is her life.  She has been with her husband, Sergio, for six years.  She lives with her mother-in-law, who's a big help and has given her a hand.  \r\n\r\nShe studied a lot as a first-aid technician in the Red Cross.  She finished high school with a lot of effort when she was 18, because she had her daughter when she was 17.  She has worked since she was young to pay for school, so she knows what it is to take money out of your pocket to pay for the things you want.  This is why she learned to appreciate things.\r\n\r\nShe has worked at everything: as a babysitter, in gardens, as a pre-school assistant, brushing hair in the home, selling shoes and clothing, in restaurants.  All this has helped her get experience and know what it is to work.\r\n\r\nShe wants to finish her program to be able to give her daughter a better quality of life and have her own spa, be her own boss, and do what she likes, although she works in a company that has nothing do do with this.  She likes it because thanks to this job she managed to begin studying the profession she always wanted to.\r\n\r\nShe considers herself a responsible, sensible, and committed person who's dedicated to the things that make her put passion into everything.  She's a good mother and she always achieves what she sets out to.\r\n\r\nShe knows that with this help from Kiva she'll save money to be able to buy the materials required by her program so she can begin to practice her profession by giving massages in the home.  It's a good way to begin to get experience and clients.  When she achieves her dream of setting up her own spa she'll have the patients who will help her get ahead with her dream.\r\n\r\nFinally, she wants to thank those who are giving an opportunity to all the people connected to this agreement between CampoAlto and Kiva.  Many, many thanks for helping people like herself who have a lot of dreams and goals for improvement so they can give their families the quality of life they deserve.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finish her cosmetology program","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-06T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-06T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katherin Yulieth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197702},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-07T10:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891024},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":151703.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912436}],"funded_date":"2013-04-06T04:52:25Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":545611,"name":"Angelina","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Casada e m\u00e3e de 2 filhos, apenas 1 frequenta a escola, vive na casa pr\u00f3pria e sustenta mais uma neta que vive com ela.\n\u00c9 comerciante tem um negocio pr\u00f3prio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos.

With a lot of hard work and a lot of dreams this mother of one son makes a living planting and growing basic grains (rice, corn and beans). She graduated from school with a lot of effort and sacrifice thanks to the support of her parents, who taught her about farming for many years, since it has been the family's livelihood for generations and still is to this day. Jenni and her family rent the land they cultivate, and her house was inherited from her husband's parents. The land they work on is four kilometers from where they live, and they go either by foot or by bike every day.

She lives in the small village of Khashuri District with her husband. Marine has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milking cow, whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides, they have 2 hectares of agricultural land, which have not been cultivated during the last 5 years. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarine requested a loan from Credo to start-up the family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

He lives in Orkhevi village near Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia with his wife Tamar and two daughters who are going to school. Hamlet requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nHamlet is working at the local market, selling fruits and vegetables. His wife is working at the supermarket and they both get small monthly salaries. \r\nHamlet requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Hamlet will purchase a car and a stock of fruits and vegetables to start trading himself. Hamlet will go to the local market in the capital city, buy products at the wholesale price and sell it to the resellers with the price mark-up in his district.  He is already very experienced in this field so he hopes the new business will be profitable. Part of the profit Hamlet will be reinvesting in the same business so he can develop and earn more income for the family. With the increased income Hamlet will be able to provide better living conditions for his family and also provide for his daughters' future education.

Kakamega county is located in Western Kenya and is famous for having the only tropical rain forest in the country. Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping. \r\n\r\nMatayo is married, and has one child. His wife is also a farmer, and together they grow maize, beans and cassava, and also keep poultry on their land. Matayo likes beekeeping because bees are easy to keep and don't require management. He also enjoys working with Honey Care because they don't destroy the honey combs while harvesting, allowing the colonies to produce even more honey. \r\n\r\nThis is Matayo's first loan, and he plans to use the income generated from his hives to start a maize selling business or open a small shop. In the future, Matayo hopes to purchase a motorbike that will help him transport his maize from his home to the market.

The members of this communal bank engage in different activities, such as fast food, telephone service, and stationary and shipping store owner.\r\n\r\nJacqueline owns the stationary and shipping shop and began her business more or less three years ago by saving money from a previous job she had so that she could make her dream come true.  She obtained a license from the city to open her store. In the meantime, she has encountered a few difficulties along the way, such as having to take over sole responsibility for supporting her household. This has been difficult because she would have liked to have a little more help from other members of her family. However this does not mean she is not able to work hard for all the things she wants in life; rather it encourages her to continue excelling.\r\n\r\nJacqueline will use her loan to purchase more supplies for her stationary and shipping store. She is very pleased because the school year has started and she is sure she will have much more business. She is very grateful and happy to participate in Fondo Esperanza because they have taught her many things. She also believes that the most important thing in her life is to have the confidence to take risks so that she can make her dreams come true. \r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4225,"image":{"id":1326096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase supplies for her stationary store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Valdivia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2013-04-06T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-06T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":4225,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Pamela Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Javier Jerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mercedes Albina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yovanka Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Victoria Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marcela Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Erna Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violeta Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Albina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Eliana Mireya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Jeanette Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Adelina Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1990000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141559},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":141649},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":141738},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":141828},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":141918},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":142007},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":142097},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":142187},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":142277},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":142367},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":142457},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":142547},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":142637},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142732}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.93},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.69},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1478.38,"local_amount":696328,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":699200.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364523536},{"amount":1223.58,"local_amount":576313,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":578690.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924431},{"amount":1261.15,"local_amount":594007,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":596457,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382145778},{"amount":261.89,"local_amount":123352,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":123860.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564038}],"funded_date":"2013-04-08T14:09:08Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:09:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":545080,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is a 35-year-old Lebanese married man living with his wife and two school-aged children.

This kind of work enables her to generate an income to support her household since she lives in a common-law relationship and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she enjoys the training workshops on health and loans, sharing with her co-members and the savings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":1326649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase canned goods and sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-04-06T17:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-06T17:30:04Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eladia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulogia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30404.01,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5067.51},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5067.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5067.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5045.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5089.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5066.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":729.19},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":729.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":729.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":726.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":732.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":729.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":729.19,"local_amount":5067.51,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5075.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625460},{"amount":729.19,"local_amount":5067.51,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5075.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021417},{"amount":729.2,"local_amount":5067.51,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5075.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809225},{"amount":726.06,"local_amount":5045.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5053.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669295},{"amount":732.32,"local_amount":5089.25,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5096.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915056},{"amount":729.04,"local_amount":5066.42,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5073.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197687}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T11:55:01Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T18:31:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":545135,"name":"Bernardina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernardina is a 53-year-old married woman from Panglao, Bohol.

Today, in order to increase her sales, she decided to take a loan from Kiva Partner Vitas s.a.l to purchase tools and supplies with added related accessories.

So far two of his children attend various schools in Kooki.\r\nHe is a farmer who deals in raising cattle. He started farming in 1993 with six cows.  Now he has over 60 Ankole long-horned cattle (local breeds). He also grows plantain and maize, but on a medium scale. He sells his agricultural products to the local community, most especially fishermen from a Kanagisa fishing site and cattle traders from Kampala.\r\n\r\nThe reason why he started farming was for personal development, and for that reason he has managed to acquire several plots of land from the neighbouring trading centre and various bibanja around Kanagisa and the neighboring villages.  He has acquired this loan to buy more cows in order to increase the quantity of milk he supplies.  He hopes to expand his business to the level of supplying 1000 liters of milk every day and to take good care of his family with all desired materials.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the challenges he faces are limited capital and unpredictable weather changes.  He describes himself as a humble and hardworking man.\r\nHe urges money lenders to take good care of their animals in order to reduce animal diseases.  This will help them to open up markets which were closed, and, as a result, there will be customers (clients) for the animals.  Therefore, there will be business growth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1326466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-04-06T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-06T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364993929},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373040632},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381831261},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689470},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480608},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879773},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983444},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635583},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863062},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":103598.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752181}],"funded_date":"2013-04-07T23:57:19Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T13:31:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":545161,"name":"Enkhbold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Enkhbold, 33 years old, lives with his wife and daughter in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

Now, he lives in Kapan together with his wife, sons and daughters.  His children are already grown and each has a job for which they've studied for.  Robert's wife is a teacher and works at a boarding school.  For 10 years, he has worked as a taxi driver for various services in Kapan.  In recent years, he's been driving his own vehicle as a private driver.  He says the number of his clients increased after purchasing his own car as did his profits.  Robert is very happy that during these difficult times he is able to provide for his family.  A loan of 500,000 Armenian dram will help Robert change the upholstery in his new car and to make a few technical repairs.  After this work, his car will be safe and comfortable for his clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1326513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

","en":"Ortukboy is a hardworking person.  He's married and is raising three children, aged 16, 14 and 10.  He works in agriculture and with livestock.  Growing up, he helped his parents with cattle breeding and in doing so, gained much experience in this business.  He has land where he breeds his animals, as well as grows potatoes and wheat.

","en":"Sodikjon is a good family man successful in business.  He is 55 years old and married to a wonderful woman.  His wife works on a farm.  Together, they have four children who are all grown.  For more than 20 years, Sodikjon has bred cattle and has his own large operation of 90 sheep, 10 goats, and 1 horse.  His wife helps him conduct his business since he has many animals that require much work and attention.  This year, his youngest son will get married.

She has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to expand her business. She wants to buy a variety of goods like milk, sugar, rice, soap, detergents, creams, etc. She also wants to introduce some new items for her general store in order to fulfill the demands of the customers and to increase her savings. \r\n\r\nZahida will reinvest the profit amount in her general store and use a part of it to pay her household expenses and for the education of children. \r\n\r\nShe is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their support.

25-year-old Francis; he owns a mobile money transfer business in Nakonde district. His shop is located on the border of Zambia and Tanzania. The town where his shop is located is one of the biggest border towns in Zambia, with a high traffic of business taking place. This is his story....\r\n\r\nMy name is Francis. I am 25 years old. I have two brothers, and one sister. I started running my own business while I was in school. I had a camera that I would use to take pictures of people; then I would develop the pictures and sell them. This helped me to raise money to pay for my school fees. When I completed high school, I worked in a shop as a shopkeeper, and continued to take pictures in my spare time. Through my job and photography business, I was able to raise enough money to open my own mobile money transfers shop in Nakonde, a border town.\r\n\r\nMy mobile money transfer business gives me the pleasure to associate with different people. I enjoy the comfort of running the business without being answerable to anyone but myself. I have clear goals and expectations of what I want to achieve.  When it comes to my customers, I believe that they benefit from my business because it helps them send money to their distant relatives, such as children in schools, colleges, etc. They are also able to buy mobile phone airtime from my shop.\r\n\r\nI am appealing to you, Kiva lenders, to help me with this loan. I will use the loan as the working capital float for my business. Currently, I have very little working capital, which slows down my transactions. My business is located at a border town, and as such the demand is very high, and sometimes I have to keep customers waiting because I have no cash to satisfy them. Once I get the loan, I believe that the growth of my business will be evident because I will have money readily available for my customers who want to receive money. This will help me to earn more commissions. The commissions are heavily dependent on how many customers I serve. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":1326543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To have enough working capital float so that he can serve all the customers who want to receive money from far-away senders","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Nakonde","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2013-04-06T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-06T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":2975,"lender_count":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":364.12,"local_amount":1958.28,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1962.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373062108},{"amount":372.69,"local_amount":2004.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2008.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381854158},{"amount":419.84,"local_amount":2257.98,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2262.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390712288},{"amount":453.38,"local_amount":2438.32,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2443.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399957710},{"amount":481.58,"local_amount":2590.03,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T21:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2595.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410241832},{"amount":382.83,"local_amount":2058.94,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T01:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2063.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429659121},{"amount":408.52,"local_amount":2197.09,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T16:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2201.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439893440},{"amount":92.04,"local_amount":495,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T14:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":496.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449781090}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T15:21:21Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T14:15:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":545193,"name":"Lala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lala is a 26-year-old woman, who is married and has two children.
