Her husband\u2019s income is not enough to meet the household and educational expenses of their children, and they are facing many hurdles in life. Nasreen is helping her husband by selling clothing in her house; she has been doing this for three years. She has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to expand her business. The main purpose of loan is to buy a variety of clothes at a cheaper rate and then sell them for a profit. In the future she is looking forward to opening a small boutique in the market. She would save some money from the profit and pay the educational expenses of her children. She has a bright vision and this loan could help her to fulfill her dreams. She is very thankful to BRAC Pakistan and Kiva for their support.

He is an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) and lives in an IDP Settlement with his family in Bilasuvar. He breeds cows and cattle, and he sells milk and milk products, as well as cattle for meat purposes to local butchers. Mais has 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father who taught him how best to look after cattle. He receives 80 AZN in financial support from the government monthly, but this is too low to cover family needs.\r\n\r\nMais usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them for five to six months, then resells them at a profitable price in the local livestock bazaar.  Milk and yoghurt he sells to the neighbors. Milk and meat sales bring 130 AZN income per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as meat are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in such everyday national dishes as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce.

He has been engaged in cattle breeding for the past 12 years. During these years he gained the necessary skills and knowledge for effective management of his business. He usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, and then resells them for a profitable price in the livestock bazaar. He also makes homemade yoghurt and sells it, together with fresh milk, to neighbors. His monthly income is 130 AZN. This business is the only source of financial income in his family.

People use meat in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolma, and always use yoghurt sauce. Milk products are considered very healthy and are also present in everyday life. \r\n  \r\nThis is the only financial income in his family, and it is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children.

In 2008, she received her high school degree.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, because her step father had to move for work and because she wanted to go to college, they moved to this city again, where she began to study  medicine at the Fundaci\u00f3n Universitaria San Martin. At the same time, she studied English at the Passport Language Academy, all of which was interrupted by her pregnancy. \r\n\r\nOn April 11, she entered the Federman to give birth to her daughter Zaray. Now she is two years old and goes to the Luz Del Ma\u00f1ana day care. For reasons not to be mentioned here, she does not live with Zaray's father. This has not been an obstacle to giving all of the love and education she can to her daughter, of whom she is very proud and for whom she gives her life. \r\n\r\nShe lives the area of health. One of her goals is to be a doctor but for reasons of time and money, this goal is being postponed temporarily, while still being a priority. Because she likes working in health she is studying to be a nurse's assistant at the Instituci\u00f3n CampoAlto. there she has shown that help, attention and care for others is her passion. \r\n\r\nRight now, she dreams of being a good nurse, being a good example to her daughter and continuing to value her mother and her grandmother. She is very grateful to God for having education and values that her mother gave her, which made her the good person that she is today, honorable and eager to get ahead.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1326728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finish her degree in assistant nursing with Campoalto","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-07T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-07T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Fernanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.76,"local_amount":176000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":190716.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197705},{"amount":61.91,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-10T10:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":112696.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891029},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":151706.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912441}],"funded_date":"2013-04-07T02:54:56Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":545224,"name":"Faith Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Zimbabwe!

She is a trader and has for the past few months been selling on a retail basis various types of fresh food (tomatoes, onions, refined oil) depending on the season, in a local market. She knows her suppliers well and, more significantly, her customer base, which she has built up over time due to her experience in this field. However, she finds that she is constantly out of stock because she is obliged to totally run it down before getting new stock owing to her small amount of capital. She would like to increase her stock of goods by buying wholesale and thus be able to satisfy the constant customer demand and avoid running out of stock. She will save her profits not only to expand her business but also to provide for her family's needs.

They live happily in a large house that has a fruit orchard and a big cattle shed where Suhrob keeps cows. For the last 12 years, he has been raising cattle. He now has 7 cows, calves, and 1 horse. He knows all the ins and outs of animal husbandry and is skilled at his business. He purchases livestock, takes care of them for several months, then sells them at the local market. Thanks to their good quality, there is a high demand for Suhrob's cows and he has built up his own clientele. His wife helps him to run the business. He now wants to develop his business further, and in order to do that, he needs to purchase more cattle. Suhrob is seeking a loan of 12,000 Tajikistan Somoni for that purpose.

Her husband is employed and gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover all the family's needs.\r\nFor the past three years, Zainab's husband has been selling traditional jewelry such as necklaces and bracelets to customers and to other cosmetic stores. He has a good reputation among his customers, which makes his project a profitable one and a second source of income for the family.\r\nZainab is requesting a Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing additional collections of traditional jewelry that has been requested by his customers. This will increase sales and improve the family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is married and a mother of one child. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Parwin is one of the many Iraqi women who are working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\nParwin learned to sew at a young age, and has 10 years sewing experience. For her small, home-based business she already completed a small loan in the past which she used to purchase a generator, an overlock sewing machine, and a table for the machine. Having successfully repaid the previous loan and still looking for ways to improve her business, she is now taking a new loan. This time she would like to buy an embroidery machine and also focus on improving her work conditions by renewing her work area's floors and walls.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

With this business activity, the community will have a regular supply of drinks for ceremonies. Drinks will be sold to customers at discount prices and there will be availability at all times.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, he will expand the business by buying more crates, finance his children\u2019s education, and renew the business site.

She is a fighter who is enterprising and grateful to God and who has a desire to improve and succeed.  She is married and has five children who are all adults.  She has a granddaughter in kindergarten who depends on her since her parents live in the United States.  She went to school through fourth grade and could not continue due to a lack of financial support since her parents had limited resources and could not support her.  \r\n\r\nSince her childhood, she has worked cultivating coffee.  Her family did this work and today it supports her family.  Her parents taught her to work the land more than twenty years ago and now she works with her husband.

She will also buy vegetable seeds. All these will help in her farm work. Part of the loan will also be used to pay labour for clearing and tilling which will ease her farm work. According to her this business is bound to succeed because she plans on putting in the best effort required for the business to grow from strength to strength, and she will buy just the pressing items needed by the community.\n\nFrom this business the community will benefit from availability of food items at all times, she will sell at reduced prices, commodities will be sold at their door step so they won\u2019t go to long distances in search of the items.\n\nWith the profit from this business, she will educate her children and insure being able to pay for their education, and provide three square meals to her family since she is the only breadwinner after her husband\u2019s death.

This business has been running for seven years. She also has other businesses, namely a poultry farm and a timber yard.\r\n\r\nShe learned about Milango through an employee who invited her to the group and she joined with an aim of accessing credit to better her business operations. The main challenges Rahab faces are lack of water and theft of the farm produce.\r\n\r\nRahab is applying for a loan of 31,450 Kenyan shillings to buy a water tank for her farming business. Her extra income from the loan will be added to the savings to expand the agricultural business. Her future plan in five years' time is to increase the number of her dairy

Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. She has faced many challenges in life, which include inadequate finances to educate her children, feed them, provide them with medication and the death of her father and father in-law, constant theft and the death of one of her children.\r\n\r\nWith the new loan Sophie will buy items like soap, sweets, bread, salt, magi, biscuits and other provisions. She holds a positive view of her business' success because she plans to sell these items at a junction where the demand of such items is very high and where there are few people selling them. She has many people in that community who will buy from her at regular intervals, and she plans to sell to them at reduced prices so as to have a quick turnover. With this activity the community needs will be met; the community faces a problem getting provisions since they have to travel long distances to get what they need.  Sophie's regular customers will benefit from free gifts also.\r\n\r\nThe profit from the loan will be used to buy medication for Sophie's children, their education, and also to feed the family.  GHAPE loans are preferable because of the repayment method in installments, low interest rates and no collateral securities before loan disbursement.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1326705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy soap, bread and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Bafut, NW.

Her husband is a good man, but he earns very little money.  For more than ten years, Sayohat has been raising and selling cattle to earn extra money to support the family.  Presently, she has three cows.  Besides raising cattle, she sells milk and kefir to the locals.  She lives far from the city, so she goes to her region's main city once a month to buy groceries and other necessary things.  \r\n\r\nSayohat needs to increase her income since her children have grown up and she has to pay for their weddings and dowries.  Sayohat is requesting a loan of 5000 comoni to buy cattle and feed.  She is hoping for and relying on your kindness.

She is married and the mother of five children, although only the youngest is in school. She is a fresh juice vendor, a business she has been operating for three years. She started the business with her savings. She learned about Milango through a friend who invited her to the group, and she joined with an aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations. Her main challenges are the high cost of materials and unpredictable weather, which interferes with the steady supply of fruits. Sophia is applying a loan of 41,900 KES (Kenya shillings) to buy fruits wholesale and to put up a structure where she can sell the products. The extra income will be used to pay school fees for her child. She aspires to expand the business to one that is bigger than the one she has and to serve more customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1326609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

","en":"Dilbar began taking out loans 4 years ago, and in this time, she has made progress in her work and her life. Though it is generally considered a man's field, circumstances worked out such that she earns a living in animal husbandry. She started out with one cow which she fattened and sold for a small profit. With each year, with the help of loans from MDO Arvand, she has gradually increased her herd. Having gained more experience, Dilbar has started to raise cattle and sell dairy products, the profit from which allows her to cover the daily living expenses of her children. She has 5 kids and she needs a certain amount of money to pay for their daily school needs and monthly educational costs. She really wants her children to become educated, and to this end, she is working hard to provide at least the basic means for them to study well and learn a specialisation. At present though, her kids help her in her small family business by cleaning the cattle shed and selling milk. Dilbar's motto is \"every minute is precious.\" Despite her age, she also works as a cleaner on a collective farm because in the near future, she will host her son's wedding, and this will require a significant outlay of cash. As Dilbar herself says, \"I still need to work and earn money, and later there will come the time when I can sit and take care of my grandchildren.\" Life has required her to be strong and decisive like a man, thrifty and sensitive like a woman, a caring wife, and a loving mother. Dilbar has once more approached MDO Arvand for a loan to purchase more cattle and cattle feed. She is really hoping for support and is grateful in advance for the cooperation and assistance.

This business will succeed because she has good soil for gardening and the droppings from the chicks will also serve as manure in the less fertile areas. She has ready customers who will buy the output. The community will benefit from some of the droppings from the chicks as vegetables will be sold to them at moderate prices.\n\nProfit from the business will be used for expansion of her poultry farm, education of her children in school, and furnishing of her house.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMikheil has a car. He drives it as a taxi to earn a daily income. His uncle is working on the bus line. Mikheil\u2019s cousin, Levan, is an artisan and works on constructions and renovations for private orders. They all get a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nMikheil requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Mikheil will install gas equipment in his car, as it is much cheaper than petrol. He will continue driving it as a taxi. This will significantly decrease his expenses and increase his profit. Having an increased income will give Mikheil an opportunity to provide better living conditions for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1327112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To install gas equipment in his car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tbilisi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-07T22:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-07T22:00:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mikheil ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":81.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.41,"local_amount":68.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":68.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969131},{"amount":70.17,"local_amount":70.17,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":70.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749549},{"amount":72.37,"local_amount":72.37,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":72.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613456},{"amount":73.86,"local_amount":73.86,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":73.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857174},{"amount":75.76,"local_amount":75.76,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":75.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133827},{"amount":77.92,"local_amount":77.92,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":77.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107417},{"amount":161.51,"local_amount":161.51,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":161.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254972}],"funded_date":"2013-04-12T17:06:31Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T10:29:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":545390,"name":"Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teresa es una mujer de 32 a\u00f1os de edad luchadora con un grado de escolaridad de primaria completa que junto a su esposo y sus 4 hijos se han podido superar gracias a la dedicaci\u00f3n en la actividad del cultivo de hortalizas (papa).

Thanks to her effort, she was able to open a business that sells dairy products like butter, and different types of cheese in the area where they live. She got the land where they grow things like corn and beans as an inheritance from her parents. Her customers for the different products that she sells and makes are neighbors and nearby communities close to where she lives. Her crops are 100 meters from her house. She walks there every day. She learned this activity when she was very young, because her parents have been farmers their whole lives. Currently, she is asking for help to buy fertilizers and manure for her corn and bean crops. This will keep them safe and free from the plagues that damage them. Her short-term goal is to buy some cows and machines to produce her own products. This will help her earn a higher income and lower the cost of buying to resell, as well as getting a clean and safe harvest to take advantage of it 100%. Her dream is to send her children to university so that they can study and excel and have careers that help them to improve the business she is setting up so that it becomes a company.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1326876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and manure for her corn and bean crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Siguatepeque, Comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-04-07T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-07T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2.1,"local_amount":40.58,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":41.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381922836},{"amount":0.62,"local_amount":12,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390787317},{"amount":1.75,"local_amount":33.77,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":34.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070248},{"amount":1495.53,"local_amount":28913.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":29309.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833644}],"funded_date":"2013-04-10T18:32:32Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T13:42:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":545436,"name":"Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Teresa de 58 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a todo tipo de artesania como dulces, bisuteria entre otros, vive en una casa que alquilan desde hace 28 a\u00f1os con su esposo que trabaja de mecanico, con las ganancias que obtiene y con la ayuda de su esposo logran solventar los gastos que se le prentan en su hogar, tambien obtienen la ayuda de una nieta que les manda remesas cada mes, ella solicita el credito para poder comprar mas materiales y productos para elaborar sus ventas y obtener mas ganacias para poder llevar una vida mejor al lado de su esposo.

","en":"Adolat is 60 years old. She is married but has no children. For over 30 years, Adolat has been raising livestock and has plenty of experience with this work. She owns three cows and 1.45 ha [about 3.5 acres] of land, where she grows hay for her cattle. She lives in a remote area  with low population density, which is why Adolat is able to own a large house. She is very satisfied with her business. She has always dreamt of having children.

","en":"The \"Las Flores 2\" group is found located in a very tranquil community in which many people work growing corn.  The majority of the group members have known each other since they were little.  They express that they enjoy living in this community because the festivals are very pleasant, especially the festival to celebrate the Virgen of Guadalupe on December 12th.  There are seven members that make up this group, all of them very hard-working and responsible women.  They they choose the group name because they liked it a lot and everyone agreed.\r\n\r\nLuci, who is the group's representative, is 20 years old and has lived with Marco Antonio in a common law marriage for the past four years.  Together they have formed a family with one child who does not yet attend school.  Luci is requesting the loan to be able to purchase two young lambs that she will raise so that they can reproduce and someday she will have enough and can sell them when she encounters financial problems.  She began raising sheep five years ago and had two sheep, but she had to sell them.  For this reason, she wants to have sheep again.  Luci comments \"I really enjoy this activity.  The only difficulty is that at this moment, I don't have a stable to accomodate them.\"  Luci believes that if the sheep don't have a good stable, they may get sick more easily because it is cold in the mornings.  However, this hasn't hindered her from continuing to raise her sheep so that some day, she will have many sheep, both large and small.  This will help Luci's family to live without financial worries.  Like Luci, the rest of the group members are also happy to receive the loan that Vision Fund and KIVA have granted them.

In this way, according to him, he can earn a lot of income. In his village there is a very high demand for people to work on the land with a tractor and they always pay for this service. \r\n\r\nNow Dusan decided for the first time to request a loan in order to buy a tractor. The loan will help him to earn an income for living expenses. He hopes in the future to expand his business to buy more tractors and to hire employees to work for him. His goal is to save money for his future and to get married. He wants to thank all Kiva lenders who are helping him to start his business!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1326642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a tractor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"XK","country":"Kosovo","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42.583333 21","type":"point"}},"partner_id":240,"posted_date":"2013-04-08T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-08T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dusan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"EUR","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":72.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":76.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":86.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":88.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":90.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":92.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":94.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.61},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":94.68,"local_amount":72.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":73.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364565651},{"amount":96.97,"local_amount":74.59,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":75.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372964581},{"amount":99.32,"local_amount":76.4,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":76.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381745265},{"amount":101.63,"local_amount":78.18,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":78.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390609390},{"amount":104.25,"local_amount":80.19,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":80.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399853319},{"amount":106.69,"local_amount":82.07,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410128712},{"amount":108.86,"local_amount":83.74,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-20T09:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":84.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420424837},{"amount":112.31,"local_amount":86.39,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T18:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":86.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429543718},{"amount":231.98,"local_amount":178.45,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":179.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439764977},{"amount":120.23,"local_amount":92.48,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":93.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459137475},{"amount":123.08,"local_amount":94.68,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":95.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467953195}],"funded_date":"2013-04-10T17:35:33Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T13:56:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":545627,"name":"Khem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khem, age 59, living in a rural village of the Bovel district has four children.

Sometimes she has the help of either her children or her husband.  The difficulty she faces in selling fruit is having to do it during the winter because sometimes the profits are low.  Another impediment she must deal with is a missing extremity that prevents her from walking normally.  All of her children are grown.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe borrower will use the loan to increase her business by purchasing fruits such as bananas, oranges, papayas, melons, and other types of produce.

with her hand raised. She works hand in hand with her husband to manage the household expenses and says, \u201cWe work together for our dreams to come true\u201d.  She weaves for income while her husband is a carpenter to support the family. \r\n\r\nLhingboi says weaving without a loom is painful for her backbone and a lot of time is consumed to finish the woven products. She wanted to get a loom, but always failed because she has three kids to take care of. Providing them with education is not a small task for irregular incomes like theirs. She could weave only two or three wrap-around skirts in a month, provided she is in good health. The amount she gets after the sales are not sufficient to start a weaving business. There never was a time where she could spare her savings to get a loom. On the other hand, her husband earns money by woodworking, which provides an unreliable income. He gets orders for furniture and most of the time, he fails to deliver them on time because he can\u2019t afford to buy advanced tools for his woodworking. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Lhingboi will get a loom and try to secure her business by producing more woven products with the help of the loom. She also says that her chance for weaving at middle age is very low but with the loom, she can continue her weaving activity for a long time. And with the returns, she is planning to get advanced tools for her husband, to enable him to be successful in his business, too.  \r\n\r\nShe says that both her husband and herself will continue their businesses until their kids can replace them and manage the family. She is thankful towards Kiva and WSDS for the support and wishes you great success in your own ventures."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1320681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a loom for weaving.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-04-08T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-08T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"S.

The land that they work is their own, thanks to an inheritance from her in-laws.\r\n\r\nMarina is requesting help to buy fertilizers, manure, pesticides, and a spraying pump for their coffee crop. These types of products are expensive nowadays, and the roya, which is a [fungal] disease that affects the coffee plants if they aren\u2019t treated in time, could contaminate the crop and they could lose the entire harvest. \r\n\r\nHer dream for the future is to have a large coffee farm, one that could continue giving them blessings, a source of income for the family, and that could be worked from generation to generation by her children and her grandchildren; they could make good use of her and her husband\u2019s hard work and dedication.

It's not easy work and even more difficult with a little daughter, but Mercedes does a good job. Thanks to her hard work she now has her own land and crops. She grows potatoes and peas for the most part, but also corn, beans, and gladioli flowers at different times. She also has two bulls for ploughing and two donkeys for transporting the products.\r\n\r\nMercedes and her husband are very happy as they enjoy farming and each harvest brings in money. She is sure that the way forward is through agriculture and saving money to buy more land so they don't have to spend it renting land. Her short-term plans are to grow peas and potatoes so she is once again seeking a loan. She plans to spend S\/. 3000 on organic fertilizer to spread on her fields. She is grateful for the financial assistance she receives so promises to make the repayments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1326166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-08T07:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-08T07:50:01Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3043.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352468}],"funded_date":"2013-04-08T19:50:36Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":545643,"name":"05.08.01 \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nhung operates a food stall selling beverages.

attended the last year.\r\n\r\nBasically, he has always lived with his entire family: his parents, his minor sister and a niece.  They rent their home and use most of their income to pay for rent and food, and to cover university costs.

He and his wife are happy and have four children. He is very hardworking and kind-natured. He has a lot of friends and all of them love him very much.\r\n\r\nGulmurod has been busy with farming for 20 years, producing onions, carrots, wheat and other agriculture produce.

He is living with his wife and only one working child. In 1995, in order to supplement the family\u2019s income, he decided to start his own work. His job consists of selling vegetables. He has a wide variety of goods which he sells to customers from his town and the neighboring villages. \r\n\r\nToday, he is asking to borrow a loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l. to purchase a vegetable cart, where he can expose all his products.

His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, David will renovate the commercial space which was rented out. He will also purchase a stock of groceries and open a grocery shop. David decided to stop the rent, make some cosmetic repairs, and open a grocery shop, himself.

With this loan, Mrs. Awa hopes to turn an average monthly profit of XOF 30'000 (ca US$ 60), to be in part used to ensure she can provide for her children, and in part reinvested in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1328244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-08T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-08T15:30:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan    Sekou             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":42082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636613},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42082.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030124},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":42082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819617},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":42082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678508},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":42082.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678509},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":42082.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924145}],"funded_date":"2013-04-08T21:38:23Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:55:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":545831,"name":"Justo Pastor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Justo Pastor de 37 a\u00f1os de edad es padre de cuatro hijos.

He began his business by growing onions in an open field, but later he decided to buy plastic covering to protect his crop from the wind and cold, and to purchase drip tape for irrigation. His future business plans include getting refrigeration equipment to cool and store his ripened produce, and his personal plans involve completing construction on the family house.

Maroun had many years of experience as a car mechanic when he decided to open his own garage in 2005.  As he wishes to better develop his work, he is asking today for a loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l to purchase added mechanic tools. This step will facilitate his business, allowing him to receive more clients, who are going to be served rapidly. Maroun just started his career; that\u2019s why another Kiva loan will be a good way for him to expand his business and increase his earnings.

Juliet. They sell and market products and services to bottom of the pyramid (BoP) consumers.\n\nAlfones targets people who are typically not reached by traditional marketing. They go directly to the consumer, as opposed to requiring them to visit their shop. Alfones\u2019 products and services include mobile phones, mobile banking services, solar lights, and efficient cookstoves.\n\nAlfones started selling Paradigm\u2019s efficient firewood cookstoves in 2010. They saw it as a beneficial product for their customers, most of whom live in rural areas and cook over three-stone fires. This traditional cooking method produces large amounts of health-damaging smoke and is very inefficient, contributing to the deforestation that is destroying Kenya\u2019s environment. Paradigm\u2019s cookstoves reduce the toxic smoke a woman inhales by 70% and reduces the fuel needed to cook by up to 50%, saving families money and time spent buying or collecting firewood.\n\nAlex and Juliet started Alfones together in 2005. Their storefront is located in the town of Sagana, Kirinyaga county, while most marketing is field-based with operations extending to Muranga, Laikipia, Naivasha, and Nakuru counties. Alfones employs ten full-time staff, seven of whom are female.  Alfones reaches an estimated 24,000 people, over 95% of whom are women. Cookstove sales are strong and nowadays require Juliet\u2019s full attention. Juliet and her sales agents are responsible for cookstove marketing and sales, while Alex continues manages the other aspects of the business.\n\nAlfones currently offers its customers the ability to buy their cookstoves in three monthly installments. It has an almost perfect repayment rate as the groups they work with ensure proper repayment from its members. More customers are eager to purchase cookstoves, but Alfones struggles to raise enough low-interest capital to finance the cookstoves to allow more women to pay on credit. With a loan from Kiva, Alfones will be able to offer cookstoves to more women and offer better credit terms of four monthly installments instead of three.\n\nWith a Kiva loan of $4,650, Alfones will receive 300 fuel-efficient cookstoves from Paradigm and will offer its members improved financing terms to purchase a stove. This will make the stoves accessible to even the lowest income women in their customer base.\n\nHelp improve the health and financial stability of a rural family in Kenya today!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":1323303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cookstove products for sale to end users","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Sagana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.666667 37.2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":286,"posted_date":"2013-04-08T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-08T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":4650,"lender_count":163,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfones Communications Ltd","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1179.69,"local_amount":1179.69,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1179.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020134},{"amount":1194.37,"local_amount":1194.37,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1194.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381807987},{"amount":1143.91,"local_amount":1143.91,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1143.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390668058},{"amount":1132.03,"local_amount":1132.03,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-26T08:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399913863}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T19:19:18Z","paid_date":"2013-09-26T08:46:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":545711,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is 37 years old, married, and has three children who attend school.
