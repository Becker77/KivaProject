She lives in Khoni district with husband, her 25-year-old son, and her 23-years-old daughter-in-law. Mariam requested loans from local financial institutions several times for her family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family's poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nHer family owns an agricultural plot of land where maize is grown. Also they have a milk cow. Mariam is milking the cow to make dairy products and sells them along with the harvested maize at the local markets.\r\n\r\nMariam requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan Mariam wants to start trading in household goods. She will go to the capital city to purchase stock at wholesale prices, bring it to her village and sell it with the price markup among her villagers. This business will bring good profits to Mariam's family. She plans to reinvest part of the profit in the same business and use another part for providing better living conditions for her family.

Due to the large family size and low monthly income, they are facing many problems. Her husband needs additional capital for the growth of his business. She has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can invest in her husband\u2019s shop.\r\n\r\nWith the loan money, her husband can buy a variety of goods like rice, sugar, soap, cereals, milk and utility items for his general store to fulfill the demand of customers and to increase his savings for the better future of their children. The profit amount would be used to expand the business and pay the household expenses.\r\n\r\nPervaizan and her husband are very hopeful that the loan will be a lucky and productive one for their

It\u2019s very difficult for Gulnaz to keep the education of her children continued because of the huge educational expenses.\r\n\r\nGulnaz is working hard to meet the family\u2019s needs by stitching clothes. She has been operating her business very efficiently and honestly for the past 7 years. She is very experienced in the stitching and sewing of dresses, and her clients always appreciate her work.\r\n\r\nGulnaz, as a member of a three-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan. With the loan amount, she will be purchasing a new sewing machine so that she can work more efficiently in the future, and her production will be increased. She can stitch more dresses in less time with a new machine. As she is living in a rented house with her family, she dreams to build her own house. She also desires to expand her business and provide quality education to her children. With the profit she is planning to open a tailoring centre for girls. Gulnaz and her family are very thankful to both BRAC Pakistan and Kiva for their support.\r\n\r\nNote: In the picture, Gulnaz is raising her

She does this as part of her life project.\r\n\r\nShe plans to become a professional and have a solid knowledge and good work stability, to study languages and have an excellent command of them, and to study gastronomy a little.

He will have a suitable production in the short term.\r\n\r\nHe will use the income from the harvest that he hopes to have for his family\u2019s well-being.  He will also meet some family goals and continue investing more in the crops.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan from FUDECOSUR.

To improve her skills, she is working as an assistant at one of the shops with which the institution has partnered.

has loved working with hair since high school, when she would spend hours coloring her hair with her best friend. Her father encouraged her to pursue her passion and start her own business. In 2008, she opened <i>The Lab A Salon<\/i> with a group of her hairstylist friends in the redeveloped, urban-chic neighborhood of North Park in San Diego. Adrianne envisioned a clean, simple and elegant salon offering a relaxing environment while still communicating a modern, trendy vibe.\r\n\r\nSince opening, The Lab has grown into a bustling business. Adrianne has a team of 18 employees and contractors working at her shop and it continues to grow. Her innovative team can create your ideal style by providing experienced advice, as well as executing haircut and color services that range from classic and beautiful to edgy and contemporary.\r\n\r\nAdrianne is taking out a $10,000 Kiva loan to perform much needed upgrades to her salon. Lighting has been a constant issue in her shop, as clients have a hard time seeing the outcome of their stylist\u2019s hard work. This loan will be used towards installing new lights as well as upgrading the front desk and other equipment.\r\n\r\nWith her business thriving, Adrianne hopes to soon open a second location and pass on what her father gave her by encouraging other young stylists to open their own businesses.\r\n\r\nVisit The Lab A Salon online at:

49-year old man.  He lives in the city of Ica in the Parcona District.  He lives with his three children, who he loves very much and who are his reason for being.  Nilton is a very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person.  He dedicates all his effort toward getting his family ahead.  Unfortunately, due to his family's low income and his needing to work from a very young age, Nilton wasn't able to study the professional career of Agronomy that he wanted to.  In his free time, Nilton likes to play soccer and sometimes cook some delicious \"chicharrones de cerdo\" (pork rinds) to share with his family. \r\nOn his own initiative and with a lot of hard-work and dedication, Nilton makes his living farming.  He has a small plot of land where he grows corn.  He works every day from very early in the morning for about twelve hours.  Nilton believes that he is doing well because of his experience and his friendly treatment of others. \r\nNilton is very grateful for the Kiva lenders, as thanks to the help they have provided, he will be able to cover the costs of compost and irrigation for his crops.  Because of this, Nilton will be able to prepare his plants to develop sufficiently and and get a good harvest from them.  And then Nilton will keep working and putting forth the effort to make his dream come true; to have more parcels of land and expand his crop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1327705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to cover the costs of compost and irrigation for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-04-09T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-09T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilton Sheling ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3038.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054893}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T05:11:55Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:22:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":545937,"name":"Fidencio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Fidencio es un hombre de 41 a\u00f1os, tiene un negocio de abarrotes desde hace m\u00e1s de 8 a\u00f1os y en el transcurso de los a\u00f1os ha podido salir adelante junto con la ayuda de su esposa.

When she was young, she studied with seamstresses who taught her how to sew women's clothing. She also graduated from the Pedagogical University. She currently works as a high school teacher, but her salary is very low and is not sufficient to provide for her family. She wants to set up her own business sewing women's clothing. She has to work very hard and earn a good income because her husband is unemployed, so she needs to cover all expenses herself. She took a course entitled \"To Get Ahead\" that was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate. She is seeking a loan of 1,000 Tajikistan Somoni to purchase fabrics so she can establish her business.

","en":"Bekhod is 32, and is married to a wonderful woman who helps him run his business. They don't have any children. Bekhod has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for more than 15 years. He mainly grows wheat, carrots, and potatoes. Because he lives in a rural area, this is his only source of income. This year he was unable to get a good harvest, and so he wants to expand the livestock side of the business, which is less risky than farming. He is seeking a loan in the amount of 2000 somons to buy cattle. He awaits your kind assistance.

Thus he maintains his finances through his work for food production.  \r\n\r\nHe needs a loan to buy one hectare of land and be able to increase his agricultural production, thus generating more income in the future.  For this reason he asks for the loan since what he saved was invested in the purchase of agricultural supplies.  He says that he is happy to be able to have access to the requested loan, and is excited to buy the land.  He is certain that buying the land is a good investment because it will increase his production capacity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1307054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy farm land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2013-04-09T16:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-09T16:40:09Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1275},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":187.54,"local_amount":1275.29,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372903705},{"amount":187.46,"local_amount":1274.79,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399793119},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":1274.92,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429487422},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":1275.22,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459081782},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":1274.78,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812160},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":1275.44,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1296.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530006304},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":1275.37,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1296.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579540781},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":1274.19,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:58:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1294.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624826460}],"funded_date":"2013-04-24T03:48:20Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T09:58:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":535012,"name":"Asteria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Asteria es nacida el 3 de marzo de 1969 en la comunidad de Chago de la provincia de Tiraque del Departamento de Cochabamba, la se\u00f1ora en realidad vive junto a su madre que ya se encuentra de tercera edad, por otro lado la Sra.

He farms with his family and lives 5 km from the village of Mizque, where there are schools. To receive primary education children have to travel every day on foot, in some cases in vehicles which could be traveling that route. \r\n\r\nBecause he has so many children to support and to meet all the expenses, Isauro even works nights in his fields to reduce production costs. \r\n\r\nBecause of the continuous rains recorded in the area during the month of February 2013, Isauro has suffered from water saturation and overflowing of the rivers, resulting in spoilage of his potato crop on his productive parcels and losses to a good part of his property. This has resulted in a reduction of his income.

Maria will use this loan to buy seasonal clothing at wholesale prices for her business. She wants to buy sweaters as the cold weather begins and is requesting this loan because she does not have enough capital to do so. \r\n\r\nMaria faces challenges within her business, including the fact that she must transport her merchandise in order to sell throughout the various markets. She will use the earnings to continue improving her business. She hopes to have her business better stocked with merchandise in order to offer a variety of products to her customers. Maria is happy and thankful for the institution for the support brought forth to her and to all of her group members. They all work hard in order to help their families get ahead.

She is married, but she doesn't have any children.  Her husband works at a high school as a teacher and he receives a small salary, which is not enough to provide for their family's needs.  Kholida decided to help her husband for the good of her family.  With that goal in mind, she enrolled in the \"To Get Ahead\" course offered by the Association of Businesswomen and received a certificate.  Now she is fully capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in that sphere.  She wants to start a business sewing and selling wedding dresses, as she has experience sewing wedding dresses and she has a vivid imagination and good taste.  Since she lives in a village far from the city center, she has many clients who want to order her wedding dresses.  Kholida will sew her dresses at home and sell them to the brides in her village.  She plans to use her income to improve her family's living conditions.  She is asking for a loan of 500 somoni to buy fabrics to start her new business.

She lives in Vani District with husband Gia and two children (10 and 2 years old). Tinatin requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow and a plot of land where nut trees are grown. Tinatin milks the cow to make cheese. Harvested nuts and the cheese are sold locally at the markets. They are refugees, so their additional income is from government institutions.\r\n\r\nTinatin requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.

Every two months, she takes some livestock to the market, sells it, and then buys other young calves right away.  This is her only business, and she is trying to expand her activity.\r\n\r\nPatma plans to use her loan to buy a few more head of cattle to increase her herd.

Arnulfo lived in the district of Santa Cruz 15 years ago, but he came to Chimore when he left behind all of his belongings and met Ines, with whom he married and had five children. Arnulfo works in agriculture and his secondary business is milling lumber for the Nueva Galilea Community. These are the two ways in which he earns money. The loan that Arnulfo is requesting will be invested in expanding his banana production. This will allow him to bring in enough money to help his children finish high school.

","en":"Sulaymon is an honest and hard-working man. He is married and has children. Sulaymon raises cattle and, in addition, grows apricots in season. In the summer he harvests apricots, dries them, and sells in winter. But his main source of income is from raising cattle. Many of his friends have left for [the Russian Federation] and encouraged him to go along with them, but Sulaymon does not want to leave his family behind and attempts to make a living in his  native country as best he can.\r\n\r\nEvery month Sulaymon brings cattle to the market for sale, and immediately uses his revenue to buy young cattle. This business brings in a very good income, so Sulaymon tries to keep developing it. For a long time, he has wanted to buy his own [truck] in order to bring cattle to the market more easily. But for now he lacks the means, so at present he plans to increase his headcount. Sulaymon wants to use his loan to buy cattle and expand his business, which will help him continue saving for a truck. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1323138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy  cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Asht","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.666667 70.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-10T03:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-10T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sulaymon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":430.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":459.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":474.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":489.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":505.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":522.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":539.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":557.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":575.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.53,"local_amount":430.36,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":440.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572699},{"amount":95.57,"local_amount":444.52,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":454.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971470},{"amount":98.71,"local_amount":459.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":469.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751989},{"amount":101.97,"local_amount":474.25,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":485.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616075},{"amount":105.32,"local_amount":489.85,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":501.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859946},{"amount":108.78,"local_amount":505.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":517.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136691},{"amount":112.36,"local_amount":522.61,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":534.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900889},{"amount":116.06,"local_amount":539.81,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":552.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550070},{"amount":119.88,"local_amount":557.57,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":570.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774295},{"amount":123.82,"local_amount":575.92,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":589.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673429}],"funded_date":"2013-04-21T11:54:29Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":545967,"name":"Linda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linda, who goes by \u201cLindy Lou,\u201d was a welder in San Francisco before a vacation in Austin convinced her to migrate to a more economical place to live. But she couldn\u2019t stand welding in the paralyzing Texas heat and was soon looking for a new line of work.\r\n\r\nThen, one night in 2003, she stepped out in a pair of <i>Souvenir<\/i> shoes which got her a lot of attention \u2013 and got her to thinking about parlaying the shoes into a new career. The Souvenir is a wooden wedge peep-toe shoe with a carved heel often with brightly painted designs. It was wildly popular during World War II when U.S. soldiers gifted them to their wives or girlfriends back home; hence, the name.\r\n\r\nLinda thought of getting them reproduced, found descendants of the family who originally hand-carved them in the Philippines, and convinced them to carve for her. She soon hit stores and trade shows worldwide with her new business, Lucky Lou, selling an average of 300 pairs per show.\r\n\r\nLinda\u2019s \u201covernight\u201d entrepreneurial success story came to a sudden halt in 2009 when she says her manufacturer began cutting corners and producing bad quality shoes, which resulted in a large number of returns and refunds. After deciding to end her business relationship with the manufacturer, Linda was shocked to find him taking everything she had, including copyrighted designs and pictures from advertising photo shoots, and selling her designs for a lot less. He effectively put her out of business.\r\n\r\n\u201cI begged and pleaded for everyone to help me,\u201d she recalls. Linda went to multiple organizations for a loan and was turned down each time until she found ACCION Texas Inc. \u2013 thanks to a referral from BIG Austin. \u201cThey were very supportive. That launch from ACCION enabled me to purchase 600 shoes, then those sales helped me to purchase 1,000,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nLinda found a new manufacturer in September and is now contracting with other designers such as Betty Page Clothing. Linda has also been in contact with tattoo artist Kat Von D and pop singer Katy Perry\u2019s managers to design something Linda will manufacture. She says, since she can place any design on the shoe, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t appeal to the entire market of women.\u201d She says, without the loan, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in business; there\u2019s no way.\u201d Because of ACCION, \u201cI just sold the first batch and made $22,000 in two days. I\u2019m doing another show this week. It was really good timing for once in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\nStores in Italy, Spain and other European countries now sell her product. And, with the initial funds from ACCION, she was able to hire a graphic designer and a photographer. Though they aren\u2019t full-time employees, she plans to put them and her assistant on her payroll soon and hire someone to take over her social media pages. When she gets an office, she plans to hire someone to work there full-time.\r\n\r\nLinda says her best-selling design is the Rockin\u2019 Tiki.

His loan request was approved in the frames of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

With the received credit Ramaz will purchase all the needed materials to open his own furniture workshop. As he is already experienced in this business and is well known among the villagers, Ramaz will have a good numbers of clients.
