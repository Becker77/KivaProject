Ella sabe que poco a poco, pelda\u00f1o por pelda\u00f1o se llega a la sima y que con el apoyo de su familia y el empe\u00f1o que ella le ponga, su sue\u00f1o finalmente se har\u00e1 realidad.\nUna de las cosas mas importantes para Caterine es mostrarle a su hija y a muchos que la edad  y los hijos no son inconvenientes para llegar a la meta.\nElla sabe que con el pasar del tiempo y con la experiencia que dan los a\u00f1os pudo enfocarse con mayor seriedad y responsabilidad en lo que hoy es su prioridad despu\u00e9s de su familia y es llegar a obtener la tarjeta profesional no en odontolog\u00eda como ella escogi\u00f3 en un principio sino como contadora y especializarse en finanzas, como su vida y vivencias le han mostrado que es lo que realmente ella sabe hacer. \nElla sin duda alguna da gracias por que ha disfrutado la vida de manera que no se arrepiente de todo lo que ha hecho  que sin duda alguna la han formado en su car\u00e1cter, responsabilidad, respeto y conciencia.

She has a lovely family: a husband and a nine-year-old daughter.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s always enjoyed studying.  Her parents, Joaqu\u00edn and Patricia, gave her the opportunity to attend elementary and high school problem-free and she has very pleasant memories of those days like being a very good student, of participating in various sports activities, in dances, in the marching band, etc.  Despite her parents being separated, they always instilled in her very important values like the appreciation for everything life can provide for her.  She continued her studies and took the admission tests for the Autonomous University to continue a professional career in dentistry where she was successful and was able to start her studies like she wanted to.  However, as life is wont to do, there were highs and lows.  Her mother, who was head of household with four children and provided economically for her studies, was unable to continue doing so and she had to drop out of the dentistry program.\r\n\r\nLater on with her own income earned at work she took a series of courses to be able to improve her work and academic profiles.  Caterine never stopped aiming at finishing her studies leading to a professional degree so like many others she works hard alongside her husband in order to be able to study financial accounting.  She knows that little by little, climbing up step by step, one reaches the summit and that with support from her family and the effort she herself puts into it her dream will finally become reality.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things for Caterine is to show her daughter and many others that age and having children is no obstacle to reach one\u2019s goals.\r\n\r\nShe knows that with the passage of time and with the experience years provides one can focus more seriously and responsibly on what one's priorities are today which besides her family are to attain her professional degree not in her original choice of dentistry perhaps but as an accountant specializing in finance which life and her life experiences have shown her to be what she\u2019s really good at.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, she\u2019s thankful for everything she\u2019s enjoyed in life and she does not regret anything she\u2019s done for it has all led to forming her character: responsibility, respect and conscience.\r\n\r\nCaterine only hopes to be in good health and to improve her economy and her work so that she can reach a new goal.  But this isn\u2019t the end; she believes she still has many dreams to reach and many goals to attain.  Undoubtedly she and her great heart will go far.\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1329215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finish her financial accounting coursework.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-11T18:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-11T18:00:12Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caterine Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":390000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.58,"local_amount":105000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":110091.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197718},{"amount":89.42,"local_amount":155000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":162516,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891046},{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136303.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391557687}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T19:09:01Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":547179,"name":"Fanny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fanny habita en la ciudad de Barranquilla, lugar donde hace 5 a\u00f1os inici\u00f3 su propio negocio, basado en productos que vende mediante gu\u00edas especializadas o cat\u00e1logos que le ofrecen grandes instituciones comerciales.

With these diverse activities she generates additional income to benefit her household, which includes her husband and their 2 children, ages 11 and 28 years.\r\n\r\nJudith's goal is to achieve an increase in their incomes and, further along, to have a place with more ample space in which to live.

Judith's major challenge is competition, since the competitors in her market are able to buy in larger volume, obtaining better prices. She must replace her merchandise continuously and her small quantities don't merit competitive prices. This is Judith's justification for approaching Kiva, to request her 1st financing through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. She wishes  to purchase sweets and primary goods such as wheat flour and other articles to use in preparing foods to sell.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Judith can augment her productivity for the potential market she anticipates and generate more income. Her 10 years of experience in her business is her greatest strength. Previously, Judith worked in a bakery where she learned techniques which she applies today, making it possible for her to work while attending to the needs of her husband and her small

He still had no future plans and no clear goal to follow or fight for. His friends told him to study a degree related to biology, while his parents wanted him to study engineering because it was the career of the future which would give him the most money. He came to understand a famous phrase during this period of his life: \"Stand up for your family.\" Since he was the first person in his family who would go on to higher education, he took on responsibility and had the eyes of everyone on his family on him. In 2011, he started a degree in Industrial Engineering at the University of La Salle. From the beginning, he knew very well that it was not what he really wanted to study, but he had a clear goal: to stand up for his family.\r\n\r\nIn late 2012, he made a decision that changed his life, for that moment and forever. He made a 180-degree turn and turned everything upside down. This decision had many repercussions, because for obvious reasons his parents decided not to support him with his studies any longer. Therefore, he started to work in a pre-university institution so that he could pay for a degree that he really wanted with his own resources. It took him a long time to realize that healthcare was the field that he really liked and that he was passionate about: that indescribable feeling of helping people when they need it, helping someone when their life may be at risk, taking care of a patient both physically and psychologically with all of their needs in order to obtain a quick and satisfactory recovery, and many other aspects. This is what he really enjoys and provides his main motivation to study something related to the healthcare field.\r\n\r\nHis dream, or his hope, at this moment is to study and to fill himself with all of the knowledge that he needs to help other people. One of his goals is to be able to study medicine. However, since he does not have the necessary resources to study that degree, at this moment he is studying nursing because he didn't want to give up on his career despite the obstacles in his life. If life has taught him anything, it is that everything starts somewhere. It doesn't matter how small or big things are, or how good the studies are, or where one studies. What is important is to know how to take advantage of the situation and to make the most out of it. The most important thing is to keep moving forward without worrying about the obstacles that life gives you."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1325001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finish his nursing assistant studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-11T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-11T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":152040.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197685},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":152040.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891007},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":152040.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845835}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T20:23:47Z","paid_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":546781,"name":"Enkhjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enkhjargal is 28 years old, married, and has one child who attends school.

cosas que en ese tiempo tal vez subestimaba, ella no le ped\u00eda mucho a cambio de todas las cosas que le daba d\u00eda a d\u00eda, solo quer\u00eda que cuando creciera fuera una persona profesional, una persona con emprendimiento, con un proyecto de vida claro, de la cual ella y toda la familia pudieran estar orgullosos, como era peque\u00f1o no cre\u00eda que lo que ellos le ped\u00edan fuera gran cosa, pero a medida que pasaba el tiempo se iba dando cuenta de lo dif\u00edcil que puede llegar a ser ese tipo de persona del cual se pudiera estar orgulloso, pero deb\u00eda lograrlo para no decepcionar ni dejar atr\u00e1s todo el esfuerzo que su madre y  familia hicieron siempre para que el lograra esto.\nSiempre trataba de tener buenas notas en el colegio y ser un alumno destacado no solo por conocimiento, sino tambi\u00e9n por colaboraci\u00f3n frente a los profesores, compa\u00f1eros incluso con la instituci\u00f3n. Para que de esta manera su madre y  familia pero en especial ella, recibieran muy orgullosos las calificaciones y las m\u00e1s sinceras felicitaciones de parte de los profesores\nGracias a esto se fue dando cuenta de algo que le gustaba mucho lo cual era ayudar a las personas siempre y cuando  hacerlo estuviera a su alcance, gracias a esas buenas calificaciones ten\u00eda una gran capacidad de an\u00e1lisis, de responsabilidad, de cooperaci\u00f3n y de colaboraci\u00f3n, as\u00ed que poniendo en pr\u00e1ctica todos sus conocimientos pod\u00eda ser de gran ayuda para todo el que lo necesitara, incluyendo a su madre, por eso desde los 16 a\u00f1os siempre que hab\u00edan vacaciones del colegio o ten\u00eda la oportunidad de trabajar trabajaba en lo que fuera, para ayudarle a ella con los gastos, era algo que ella valoraba mucho, aunque no era tan bueno para realizar algunas cosas, siempre hacia hasta  lo imposible por hacer las cosas bien y poder ayudarla.\nA medida que pasaba el tiempo e  iba creciendo ten\u00eda que decidir que iba a hacer con su vida para lograr la \u00fanica meta que ten\u00eda en el momento, hacer que todo el trabajo de su madre por el valiera la pena, pero hasta el momento no ten\u00eda ni idea de c\u00f3mo lo iba a lograr, a pesar de todo no ten\u00eda muy claro que hacer con su vida, o tal vez solo ten\u00eda miedo de descubrir que era lo que en realidad quer\u00eda para el, luego de una tiempo de an\u00e1lisis y reflexi\u00f3n fue uniendo las cosas que m\u00e1s me gustaban en la vida para llegar a una tomar una decisi\u00f3n final, al ayudar a las personas, la compasi\u00f3n del ser humano, la curiosidad por aprender cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s y por llegar a ser una gran persona le dieron la respuesta del \u00e1rea en el que quer\u00eda desempe\u00f1ar en la vida, el \u00e1rea de la salud.\nCuando tomo esta decisi\u00f3n las cosas no fueron tan f\u00e1ciles como crey\u00f3 o como alguna vez lo imagino, ya que no contaba con los recursos econ\u00f3micos suficientes para poder estudiar  medicina, por esta raz\u00f3n y por no dejar de lado esos sue\u00f1os y mis metas decidi\u00f3 estudiar enfermer\u00eda y as\u00ed poder comenzar una  carrera en el \u00e1rea de la salud y en un corto tiempo y con recursos propios poder pagarse la carrera que tanto le apasiona, por la cual no ha parado de so\u00f1ar y nunca ha dejado de fijar el horizonte \u201cMedicina\u201d.\n","en":"He\u2019s realized since he was little that to become someone in life much effort and dedication is required.  He grew up seeing his mother work long workdays to provide everything he needed like good education, clothing, food and things that perhaps he undervalued back then.  She never asked for much in return for everything she did for him every day.  All she wanted was for him to become a professional, enterprising person once he grew up with a clear life plan that she and the entire family could be proud of.  Because he was little, he didn\u2019t think that what they were asking of him was very much but as time passed he realized how difficult it is to become the type of person that one can be proud of.  But, he had to accomplish this in order not to disappoint and waste the efforts his mother and family always made so that he could attain this.\r\n\r\nHe always strove to get good grades at school and to be an outstanding student not only because of his knowledge but also because of his cooperation with teachers and classmates and even with the school itself so that his mother and family, but especially her, would proudly receive his grades and the sincere congratulations he\u2019d get from his teachers.\r\n\r\nThanks to all this, he gradually realized that what he liked best was to help people to the extent he was able to do so.  Thanks to his good grades he had good analytic, responsibility, cooperation and collaboration skills.  Putting all his knowledge and skills into practice he could be of great help to those who need it, including his mother, and this is why from the age of 16 on whenever he had school vacation or had some other opportunity to work he\u2019d do so in whatever was available to help her with expenses.  This was something she valued highly.  Even though he wasn\u2019t all that good at some things, he always did even the impossible in order to do things well and be able to help her.\r\n\r\nAs time passed and he continued to grow he needed to decide what he was going to do with his life to reach the only goal he had at the moment: to make sure that all his mother\u2019s labor had not been in vain.  However, to date he had no idea how he was going to accomplish this.  Despite everything, he still did not have a clear idea of what he was going to do with his life or perhaps feared discovering what he really wanted for himself.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of reflection and analysis he started to figure out what he liked best in life: helping people, human compassion, and curiosity to learn more every day and to become a great person to reach a final decision.  These led him to the answer to his question of what he wanted to do with his life: health.\r\n\r\nOnce he made this decision things weren\u2019t as easy as he thought they\u2019d be or as he\u2019d imagined because he lacked sufficient economic resources to study medicine.  Because of this and in order not to set his dreams and goals aside, he decided to study nursing to start a career in the health field so that in a short period of time and with his own resources he\u2019d be able to pay for the career he\u2019s so passionate about and he\u2019s never stopped dreaming about and has always kept fixed on his horizon: Medicine.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1328433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She lives with her sister and mother.  Currently she is studying toward a technical professional degree in financial accounting.  All of her life she has lived with her mother, and she is the person who has taken care of her since she was born and given her everything she has needed so far.  She is an independent woman who works at a bakery.  The truth is that her income is not high enough to continue paying an expense as large as Cindy's school fee.  Since her mother is older, Cindy is trying to get a job that would help her, since she is a single mother of two daughters who have various expenses.  With this, she would help pay for her studies and share some of the expenses.\n\nTwo years ago, she was part of a program that offered techniques for competence in the workforce.  She signed up and thanks to this program, she was able to increase her knowledge of everything that has to do with a career in public accounting.  A year ago, she worked at a corporation to expand her knowledge.  She liked it since it provided a high quality of learning and accommodated her as a person.  Now that she has the opportunity to do something for her well-being she does not want to abandon it so that she can help her mother.  \n\nChanging topics, she likes sports and exercising.

She finished and was eager to go to school and grow professionally but really in her home there weren't enough resources to go to college, much less for a major like the one she wanted. When she left high school, since she was a minor she couldn't get a job, but a neighbor helped her and she was able to work in some telephone booths weekdays. She decided to go to school to become an assistant nurse on the weekends and paid for it with her work. Of course, there wasn't enough money, but she made it work one way or another. \n\nWhen she did her internship and graduated as a nurse, she worked with a family caring for a bedridden patient. Life changed completely when she started to work and she began to take small pleasures, but they were pleasures. When the year ended she received the news that no body is expecting but that everyone knew would come. Her father died, the wonderful sole companion of her mother while they all worked to help each other with the household expenses. As if the death of her father weren't enough, her mother entered into a depression and didn't want to do anything for her own health. Jenny decided to quit her job to be with her at home, to keep her company and help her overcome this severe depression. She continued in her role as a nurse, but at night. It wasn't easy but she was happy because she was working and growing professionally. In July, her mother had a stroke, an illness that impedes her doing certain activities on her own. Since her mother had that illness, she has had physical therapy and therapy for her depression. Afterwards, she was diagnosed with degenerative osteoarthritis, a disease that has no cure. In short, she doesn't have the same cheerfulness she was known for. For this reason, Jenny tries not to go far from home so she can keep an eye on her. Her maternal grandmother, who has lived with them her whole life, helped them and cared for her daughter and grandchildren, but at her advanced age illness and maladies begin to appear. She had an emergency high risk surgery because her digestive system did not work anymore. To get back to Jenny's story, neither her mother, her grandmother are the same. Both of them are sick and Jenny is in charge of them. All of the siblings cooperate, but living with them, she feels more responsible for their well being. She decided to go to school to learn more and open her own spa. In order to pay for her studies she works a shift, then she goes to school. She picks up two children that she cares for in the afternoon and she helps them with their homework. Then she goes back to the shift and returns home.

She has formed a partnership with Nafa Naana, a social enterprise that is being created by Entrepreneurs du Monde (Entrepreneurs of the World). The partnership started in July 2012 and involves the resale of products such as gas stoves, solar-powered lamps and warming baskets. In addition to those new items, she is also charged with selling replacement gaz tanks which allows her to help fellow women as well as improve her standard of living.\nRecently, Gilberte has a financial challenge because so many of her customers are in need of solar-powerd lamps. The loan will help her to purchase 69 solar-powerd lamps for resale to her customers. This will satisfy their demand, improve her sales and improve the standard of living of her family of three children (all in school) and her husband. Notably, this will be Gilberte's third loan with KIVA; the first was successfully repaid and the second is in process of being repaid without issue. She dreams of becoming a great entrepreneur, working in imports and managing the business without loans in the future.

She and her husband, who is a farmer, work hard to continuously provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another PHP 50,000 loan to buy more fruits and vegetables. Her profits from her business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her child\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe dreams that her business will be more successful. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He has been rendering taxi services to local people since 2011 and accumulated a vast amount of experience. \r\nThe house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and needs some serious repair. So he is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 MNT (Mongolian Tugriks) to purchase building materials such as bricks, cement, wood planks and gypsum. As a result, the house will be renovated and won't lose heat through its walls and roof. More importantly, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and thus contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

Therefore, she is taking out this new loan to buy pigs and build a pigpen. She highly hopes that she can raise her pigs in a healthy condition whereby she can earn more income to better her living conditions.

He has 10 years of experience working with livestock.  His father bred livestock and Fatto helped him throughout his childhood.  Now the business is his income, it is how he earns a living. Now grown, he followed in his father's footsteps starting his own business with 5 head of ram.  Starting out was difficult, especially during the winter.  But his years of experience proved useful and he began finding ways to overcome obstacles and improve.  Today, he owns more than 50 rams, and recently he bought a cow.  His wife and 5 children take part as well.  Due to the current season, he cannot sell his rams since prices for them have fallen.  Fatto needs additional funds for feed and to buy new livestock.  With this goal, he turned to Arvand for a loan which he plans to use for these purposes.  He is grateful to Arvand for the support and big role it plays in his

For this, Rafael has his own land, measuring 20 hectares.  Seven hectares are used for growing the oil palm, an alternative to growing coca leaves.  Rafael started this work over four years ago, after he took over the land with the support of a private enterprise to whom he sells what he produces.  Rafael manages to employ two workers for harvesting, paying each of them on a daily basis.  His wife also supports him in his work.\r\n\r\nRafael likes the work because it gives him a trade to make a living.  He also likes working in the field and he uses the income from selling his products to cover household costs.  However, he does not like the plagues that affect the crops and he has to be vigilant and alert in case of any outbreaks.  Rafael has plans to continue expanding the business, by buying a vehicle to transport his product.  This is Rafael's sixth loan with Kiva.  He is counting on Kiva so that he can make his plans a reality.

Since she was a young girl, Denis has been working in agriculture.  She had to move from one place to another as her husband found work in a well-known cement factory in the area.  Denis has now been growing broad beans and peas on rented land for five years.  She still does not have her own land but in a couple of years she hopes to buy her own land.  Denis says that she sells her crops in the city but the price is lower so she prefers to sell them Lima. She always makes a higher profit there as it is on the coast and these types of foods sell for a better price in the coastal region.  This is Denis' first Kiva loan.  She is very happy with this financial support that she will receive to continue with her plans and she promises to make her repayments on time.  Denis will invest the 1000 Nuevo Soles in buying organic fertiliser to strengthen her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1329933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-12T09:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-12T09:00:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1031.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090421}],"funded_date":"2013-04-12T12:19:15Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":547248,"name":"Jose Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, solicita un nuevo cr\u00e9dito porque necesita m\u00e1s capital de trabajo para cultivar.

She is married to Mark, an employee, and mother to her four children. Along with her husband, Lizel manages her business selling chicken and fish. She works hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses. Lizel buys different kinds of fish and chicken at wholesale prices and sells them by the kilo. She buys fish at the local fish port early in the morning and many of her customers prefer her products since they are assured freshness and cleanliness. Lizel's store is located in a temporary fish market and her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in daily sales. \r\n\r\nLizel is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to buy more fish and chicken to sell every day. She hopes that her business will continue to grow. In the future, she dreams of having her own house and lot. Lizel meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She has been engaged with fattening livestock for 15 years. \r\n\r\nHalicha has extensive experience in livestock breeding; her father was a shepherd for 25 years on the collective farm in the village. As a child, Halicha heard stories from her father about how he mated and grazed the livestock in pastures. Almost everyone in the village gives the shepherd their livestock to graze. Halicha similarly trusts the shepherd with her livestock until the evening and sometimes the shepherd takes the livestock into the mountains to a green meadow for several days. \r\n\r\nHalicha wants to multiply her livestock and thus increase her capital. This year, her son will get married and she must finish building her home. She plans to sell her cattle after fattening them, and the profits will help to realize her plans. \r\n\r\nShe hopes for Arvand's help in implementing her plans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1328383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-12T16:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-12T16:00:09Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Halicha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":688.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":712.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":736.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":761.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":787.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":813.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.47},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4525.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550077}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T14:55:41Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":546915,"name":"Petimani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petimani is a 37-year-old, married woman, with six children.

She completed high school at the Polytechnic # 60. During high school she became interested in becoming a great stylist and she decided to enrol in the Rivera Institute of Beauty located in the city centre.

His loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe main source of the family's income is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard and a plot of land where maize is grown. With the harvested grapes they make wine. The sell the wine and the maize locally at the markets. The family's total income is rarely enough to cover their monthly expenses. \r\n\r\nUshangi requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with \"soft\" conditions for a business start-up or re-startup to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products. Generally, these customers are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan Ushangi will renovate commercial space that he owns. He wants to start selling cars. He will purchase from Europe at a low cost and sell at a marked-up price in Georgia. For this business he needs an office to work from.

\n","en":"Gulchehra is a very patient and open-minded person. Her work experience shows on her kind and pleasant face, for she is a teacher, a guide to the world of knowledge. She has worked in this field for 23 years. In all this time, she has taught many students who have become a source of pride for their parents and who express gratitude to their teacher, Gulchehra. She has brought up 4 children of her own, 2 of whom are currently in school, 1 who is doing post-secondary studies, and a daughter who has started her own family. As she and her husband are caring and responsible parents, they are taking an active interest in their children's futures. She is well aware that in order to realise their plans, they need a certain amount of financial resources. With this in mind, she is very careful with the family budget and is saving a nest egg. She strictly controls spending because it is very difficult to bring up 4 children and provide for her own old age on only a teacher's salary. But, like all women, Gulchehra likes to wear beautiful dresses and have a jewelry box full of beautiful things. The end of the school year is approaching and she has decided to buy herself some jewelry as a reward to thank herself for the successful completion of another year of work. However, she does not have enough cash on hand, so she has decided to take advantage of the loan services of MDO Arvand. She hopes Arvand will trust her and lend her the funds that she needs.

After several years of learning at her side, she decided to opt for trading Bazin fabric because it is very popular in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing this for the past 10 years and has acquired an extensive experience and a large customer base. Her selling strength is due to her  mastery of the inner workings in this sector,  but also to her affordable prices and the quality of her goods.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her working capital and make more profit, she is requesting a new loan. After a first individual loan was repaid properly, she is on her 2nd individual loan she will use to buy two pieces of \"bazin riche\" (high-quality bazin fabric, 100% cotton).\r\n\r\nShe resupplies in Bamako and resells cash to a mixed clientele. She also often participates in exports to Senegal.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she hopes to obtain monthly profits of 150,000 FCFA.

This loan will help in improving her family's living standards. In the future, Hellen wants to have over 5,000 chickens, both layers and broilers. \r\n\r\nLack of sufficient funds and poor markets have been her major challenges. She is happy with Juhudi Kilimo for funding her.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1328436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Savriniso is a very intelligent and hard-working woman. She is 27 years old. Several years ago, she got married, but the relationship did not work out and she divorced her husband. Savriniso has no children. After her divorce, she returned to her parents' home and currently lives with her mother. Following the divorce, Savriniso started to work as a secretary at a government office. She loves her work and performs it honestly. Her colleagues know Savriniso as a conscientious and kind woman.\r\n\r\nSavriniso spends her money on life necessities.

She is married to Francisco, a construction worker, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGloria operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nGloria dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her grandchildren will have a good education.

He is married and lives with his wife and daughter, who are his biggest priorities.  With this loan Fernando plans to buy fertilisers and other products for when he sows his crops.  With this the seeds will grow better and he will have a better quality product. In addition he will use the money to pay labourers to apply the products and to assist with the planting once everything is ready.  This way he will be able to do a good job.  Fernando is planning to take advantage of the good weather conditions and the good state of the ground in the region for these crops.  He will also use his years of experience to manage these basic grains.  As well as buying better products of a higher quality so that the crops develop well and healthy, he will also have a good yield with good production levels in the short term.  He hopes the harvest will generate a good income to look after his family's well-being and education.  He also wants to achieve some personal goals and continue investing in the plantation.

She is married to Arthur, a supervisor, and a mother to their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating her business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nLiezel maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers rely on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 15, 000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy additional supplies and products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLiezel hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams of having her own house.

Her husband is a wood cutter by profession and he has a very low monthly income.\r\n\r\nShakeela is a very responsible and skilled woman. She is using her tailoring skills to generate an additional source of income for her family. She is very experienced in stitching clothes and dresses. She has been doing this work for 5 years. Her clients are very satisfied with her work.\r\n \r\nShakeela has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to expand her business. She wants to open a tailoring business and need to purchase two new sewing machines. Her production and monthly income could be increased by having additional capacity. She would reinvest the profit in her business and also use part of it to pay educational expenses. She desires to send all of her children to school.

She arrived to Monterrey with her husband 25 years ago and they acquired a piece of land in the highest part of a hill in the north west area of the city (called Lomas de la Uidad Modelo). This is where they started to build their home. Five years later, her husband passed away and she had to get ahead and support her 4-year old daughter. She was selling sweets and candies at Aztlan Ave., near a well-known mall called Valle de Topo Chico. \r\n\r\nMaria was able to support her daughter and today she actually helps her with the business. One year ago, she decided to start a new business selling natural products (\"Club Naturista\"), where she prepares shakes to clients daily and invites pedestrians to try her products. \r\n\r\nThe requested loan will help her to increase her income, buying different products to sell inside her club. With this additional income, she plans to buy her own space (instead of borrowing it) and to provide a better service while also keeping to create a patrimony for her daughter.

She wants to expand her business by opening a garment shop in the market, because she is not getting enough customers in her house.

Her husband is out of a job, so she has to run a business to have a permanent source of income. She says that the main challenges to her business are business location and finances to run her business. At present, she is struggling to survive.\r\n\r\nShe requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone Microfinance Company Limited to buy more local foodstuff, like gari and palm oil. She says that the extra income from this loan will help her change her status from a single room to renting a big, residential apartment.

from Sierra Leone! This is 50-year-old Isatu, from Tombo, in the western, rural area of the country. She is widowed and has six children between the ages of 13 and 32 years. Two of her children are attending school. \r\n\r\nIsatu runs a local food business; she sells coconut, rice and gari. She has been running this business since 2001. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week.  Isatu says that the main challenge to her business is the poor road network in her area of operation.\r\n\r\nIsatu has requested a loan, which she will use to buy more coconut, rice and gari, to increase her business. The extra income from this loan will allow her to have a permanent business location and educate her children. In the future, she plans to open a shop. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1329625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He invested his severance pay into buying products such as frozen meat and soft drinks with plans to sell them in the local market. With this work, he has been able to earn income that has helped him manage personal expenses and study Systems Engineering in a hybrid program (both online and in person).\r\n\r\nHis primary goal is to have a suitable store to become a distributor of frozen goods by buying in large volumes. He also wants to finish his professional studies. He is currently applying for a Kiva loan, which is his second with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, because his market is in need of more meat products and drinks such as soda, water, and other beverages.

She describes her major problems as transportation and poor road networks within her operating area. \r\n\r\nMariatu has requested a loan in order to buy more wood to expand her business.

She said she is usually faced with a loss when the food is not all sold.\r\n\r\nShe requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone to buy palm oil, cooking oil, rice, and cooking seasoning. She says that the extra income generated from this loan will help her to pay her childrens' education. In the future, she would like to change her business to a general merchandise store. She is grateful for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1329659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy palm oil, cooking oil, rice, and cooking seasoning.

She studies in an institution where she has obtained a great deal of knowledge which she never thought she could grasp. She has also met several friendly people, and the teachers are very good and friendly. She likes numbers, so that's why she chose this career. She hopes to someday get a degree in accounting.\r\nShe enjoys talking to friends and practicing sports such as soccer, volleyball, running and tennis. She likes the colors blue, red and green. She greatly enjoys spending most of her time with her parents and her sister, going for a stroll, playing games, laughing and talking. Later on, these become the most beautiful memories she could have.\r\nShe likes to eat chips, candy and ice cream. She enjoys eating a lot of junk food rather than prepared meals. Also, she hates vegetables because she thinks they don't taste good, and she'd rather have chicken and pasta.\r\nOnce she finishes studying accounting, she hopes to travel to a lot of countries in order to put what she learned to practice in these locations. She also hopes to learn more about each country every day, and make her mark. At age 30 she hopes to own a house where she can live with her family which will be comprised of a husband and two children, a boy and a girl. She'll provide them with the best possible education and teach them how to appreciate everything they have and own, because in order to get ahead it's important to never forget the past.

She's been happily married for over 30 years, and from her marriage she has four children, two of whom are adults and two are underage. The underage children attend different grades in elementary school and depend on her. Her daughter-in-law lives under her roof; she doesn't have any children yet and she helps with domestic chores and other daily household activities. Fidelina has an incomplete elementary school level education. She studied up to the second grade and couldn't go on due to a lack of financial support, since her parents have a low income. They were the ones who taught her to work in agriculture from a very young age. She grows plantains, a business that has been the only source of income for her family for several years and still is to this day. She owns the land where she works, thanks to the years of efforts from herself and her husband. Her produce is sold in grocery stores in the area where she lives, in villages near that community and other locations, since her crops are high quality and have good size. Her crops are located three kilometers from her home, and they ride animals to get there. Her husband and two of her children are involved in maintaining and nurturing the crops.\r\n\r\nShe's currently requesting support to purchase compost and other supplies in order to keep her produce healthy and safe from any pests or diseases that may damage the crop.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to own a large plantain farm that is the best one in the area. That way she'll be able to turn a profit and start a new project such as a coffee crop. The area is suitable for that because of the weather and the healthy, fertile soil. Her dream is to be able to have her two younger children graduate from college and keep the business going so that it will grow more prosperous and be handed down from generation to generation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1330884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural
