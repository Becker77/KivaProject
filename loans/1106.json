He lives in a small village in the Telavi District with his wife, 20-year-old son and mother. He has previously requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nZaza is working as an electric welder. His wife works as a kindergarten teacher locally. In addition, the family is involved in agricultural activities. They have a vineyard and 300 peach trees. They sell the harvested products locally. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nZaza has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved within the frameswork of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

He lives in the Senaki district with his wife, two sons and his retired in-laws. Sergo has previously requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nSergo owns a car. He is renting it out and gets a small monthly income. In addition, the family's income includes Sergo\u2019s parents in-laws' monthly pension. The total income of the family is rarely enough to cover their monthly expenses.\r\n \r\nSergo has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the credit received, Sergo will purchase a truck for towing cars.

She is married with one child who is 10 years old. Her child is currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Sarah established her clothing business. She began her business when she graduated from her vocational training center. She usually prepares the local fabric and takes it to a tailor for the product to be finished. She works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says the high cost of rental is the main problem she faces.\r\n\r\nSarah requires a loan in order to buy a sewing machine. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and start a savings account. In the future, Sarah plans to employ staff to sew her products.

At that point, she decided to start a business. She works at the business from Monday to Sunday. She also earns income through her garden work (agriculture). Transportation is one of the major challenges she is presently facing: to transport her cassava from the village to town.\r\n\r\nAminata has requested a loan in order to buy seed for her garden and expand her bakery business. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children up to university level. In the future, she plans to become the first international cassava bread seller. She appreciates your support.

She lives with them in an adobe house.  Thanks to her parents, she has been tied to agricultural work ever since she was a girl.   Their main form of financial support was organic cacao production.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching adulthood, she inherited a plot of land, which she allocated entirely to the production of cacao.  When she got divorced, she managed to get her independence.  However, her greatest difficulty was having the capital that would allow her to buy seedlings to replace the old cacao trees.\r\n\r\nCurrently her land is found to be in a good productive state.  This motivates her to continue investing in a fluid manner.

His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Levan will purchase grocery stock to open a grocery shop in his own commercial space. As the space is in a populous area, Levan hopes he will have a big number of customers and earn good income. Part of the profit will be used for reinvesting in the same business.

is 61 years old. He lives in the village of Chapala, Bolnisi district, with his 56-year-old wife, 33-year-old son and his daughter-in-law. Saiat requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land where potatoes, cucumbers and tomatoes are grown. Harvested products are sold locally at the markets and the family gets a small monthly income which is not enough to cover their monthly expenses.\r\n\r\nSaiat requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

is a Peruvian artisan who crafts sterling silver jewelry. She hopes to stock up on sterling silver while its price is low, and to develop a good supply of designs.\r\n\r\nGiuliana has been selling through NOVICA since 2005. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"As a child, I loved creating my own jewelry to wear at parties, or to give as gifts to friends. In college, I signed up for elective courses in jewelry making, where I learned the essentials of the craft. For me, this was a hobby I kept refining and perfecting. I was still taking courses when my husband passed away. At that point, I quit school to seek a steady job to support my young son. That has been the greatest challenge of my life. I decided to set up my own workshop where I could develop my jewelry designs. My designs speak of tradition yet are modern, and they feature the harmony between metal, pearls and gemstones. I'd like to show the world the hand-crafted filigree styles developed in Peru over the centuries.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I come from a region renowned for batik artistry. I transfer traditional textile batik techniques to wood. I specialize in Indonesian batik ornaments, but focus more in the classic styles of Yogya and Solo. The color I use is 'sogan,' or brown, a trademark of the Yogya-Solo style.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to add new designs to my collection, and this microcredit will make it possible for me to carry out my plan.  I want to make batik become more familiar to all the people in the world, not only in Indonesia, and I hope they come to appreciate batik as an ancient art form that will sustain and grow in time. Thanks for supporting me and my project, and for loving Javanese batik. This microcredit will go toward the preservation of the batik legacy for the world.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Handaru's handcrafted batik art on the NOVICA site:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/1572"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1329887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in the purchase of wood and wax, in order to increase production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Java","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2013-04-13T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-13T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Handaru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":3.9,"local_amount":3.9,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373010215},{"amount":10.21,"local_amount":10.21,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-25T08:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381796112},{"amount":9.02,"local_amount":9.02,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390869565},{"amount":12.31,"local_amount":12.31,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T16:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":12.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399904822},{"amount":130.31,"local_amount":130.31,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T17:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":130.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410186641},{"amount":67.91,"local_amount":67.91,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T19:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419949262},{"amount":66.34,"local_amount":66.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":66.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602067}],"funded_date":"2013-04-13T19:04:43Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:11:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":547261,"name":"Cristo Es La Esperanza 1, 2 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefa is the coordinator of Cristo es la Esperanza 1, 2 & 3 (Christ is the Hope 1, 2 & 3).

This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"Although I have taken courses in artistic design, I consider myself self-taught, since I have learned more from practice over the years. My work strives to show the inherent goodness of artisan labor. I enjoy sharing and teaching something of our own culture. I've formed a small working community of artisan families.

He is a humble farmer from the Santa Lucia district on the outskirts of Teustepe.  He has been planting corn and beans since he was very young.  He started this activity when he was very young and at ten years old, he worked along with his parents and siblings so that the family could survive.  He was only able to complete primary school.  Currently, he specializes in planting basic grains and breeds livestock in the winter.  He dedicates himself full-time to planting and storing grains to have for the summer season and in this way, he is able to sell during shortage periods.   One of the activities that he needs to strengthen is the livestock breeding but he doesn\u2019t have his own land and so he does not have land that is in good condition.  He needs financing to pay the lease on 3 \u201cmanzanas\u201d [land measure = 1.75 acres] and to purchase insecticide to protect his crops and animal pastures from blight. One of his next goals is to plant watermelon to diversify his crops and to have his own land so that is animals will have better conditions.

She is 44 years old, married and has two children.  She was unable to receive a higher education since her family has had financial problems since she was just a child.  Shahodat's husband is a migrant worker in Russia since it's difficult to find work in Tajikistan.  She buys and sells household products.  In the beginning, it was difficult because she needed funds.  In 2008, she rented a store at a local market and 5 years later, in 2012, she bought her own store with the money she earned.  Last year, she was advised to turn to Arvand to take out a loan.  With that capital, she expanded her selection of inventory and coincidentally increased her family's income.  She is very glad that she made the decision to use Arvand.  She has big plans for the future and very much wants her children to go to college and does everything in her power to reach this goal.  With this loan, Shahodat again will buy household products to expand her inventory.  She is very grateful to Arvand since with the help of such organizations, those with financial problems can achieve their goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1329418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

He is engaged in selling quarry stone (stones for home construction) and has been in this business for five years.  He began working as a stone loader at a very young age.  Sometimes, he was a driver and at other times he worked as a salesman and loader at the same time.  But he put his mind to saving to buy a truck with the goal of becoming independent and establishing his own business.  He saved for five years until he was able to buy a used truck that his old boss sold to him.  He has two helpers when he makes the trip to the capital city of Managua to sell quarry stone.  He is pleased to be getting ahead and tries to provide the best he can to his children.  One of the projects he has planned is to install a general store in his home for his wife to manage and in this way, gain another source of income.  He is requesting the loan to purchase two tires and quarry stones to sell.  The loan will permit him to maintain his truck in good condition since it is his main tool.  In addition, he will have material to sell.  In the future, he would like to purchase a truck.

Her idea for this business was born in 2009 when her spouse, working as an employee in a store, proposed that she start the same business, and they gathered capital to launch it. \r\n\r\nShe makes her sales in cash, working from Monday through Sunday, from 7 in the morning to 9 at night. Her main customers are her neighbors from her neighborhood and other sectors, which have, little by little, been adding to her client base. Her goal is to grow and later become a wholesaler to give her children opportunities and have future of greater prosperity.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she is applying for a Kiva loan, with which she will buy accessories for cellular phones. These are the items that have a higher turnover in her business and make her Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1331536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase accessories for cellular phones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-04-13T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-13T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71637},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79966},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81832},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83741},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85695},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":87695},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89741},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91835},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":93978},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96170},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":98414},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":109296}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.17,"local_amount":71637,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":73249.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928737},{"amount":44.84,"local_amount":79966,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":81766.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705889},{"amount":45.89,"local_amount":81832,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":83674.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968177},{"amount":46.96,"local_amount":83741,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":85626.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817365},{"amount":48.05,"local_amount":85695,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-28T08:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87624.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323638},{"amount":49.17,"local_amount":87695,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T09:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":89669.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082872},{"amount":50.33,"local_amount":89741,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":91761.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062236},{"amount":51.49,"local_amount":91835,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-23T09:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":93902.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731927},{"amount":220.18,"local_amount":397858,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":406815.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.92,"payment_id":450415162}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T13:06:03Z","paid_date":"2014-02-21T09:53:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":547320,"name":"Solanye Sarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Solanye es una mujer de 21 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Ica, en distrito de Parcona con sus padres y hermanos, Solanye es una persona muy amable, trabajadora y entusiasta, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por salir adelante;

She lives in the south of the city, where she sells footwear, perfumes, clothes, and personal cleaning products. She began in 1991, when she felt that she was not doing anything and wanted to have her own money to pay her expenses. She was managing the domestic expenses with what her husband gave her to support her family and gathered her first capital to buy inexpensive articles and sell them on credit to her family members, neighbors, and friends, who were her first true market.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she sells not only on credit, but also in cash. Every day she begins working at 9 in the morning and ends at 6 in the evening. She makes her purchases in cash in the neighboring country and in department stores situated in the city of Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nMaria has received three financings from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she has been able to adapt her store with showcases and fill them, in order to make an impact on her customers and grab their attention, awaken their interest, desires, and inspire their purchase of her products. Her goal is to make her business grow more all the time, and because of this she is attentive to obtain loans to invest in the capital of her store and increase her income. This is the reason why she turns to a Kiva loan, by means of which she will buy sweaters, footwear, jeans, perfumes, personal cleaning products, among other articles with a greater turnover that provide her immediate income. This is precisely what makes her Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1331543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Desde muy joven trabaj\u00f3 como empleada y posteriormente cuando no consegu\u00eda empleo, su negocio se convirti\u00f3 en la mejor alternativa de ingresos para ayudar a su familia y desarrollar su hogar. Su meta mas adelante es tener un local, lograr crecimiento empresarial, pero su mayor desaf\u00edo es no tener suficiente capital de trabajo para lograr la meta. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, segundo financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 ropa, con ello tendr\u00e1 disponibilidad en la entrega de mercanc\u00edas a sus fieles clientes, especialmente porque se acerca la temporada en la que el volumen de sus ventas se incrementan; as\u00ed es que Nanis necesita tener un fondo de capital, para responder a esta demanda. \nNanis con su anterior credito a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, compr\u00f3 perfumer\u00eda, cremas y productos capilares, que en sus cat\u00e1logos llegaron con muy buenos descuentos; esto fue una gran oportunidad para aumentar sus ganancias, tener un inventario que rot\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente y para poder ofrecer mejores precios a sus clientes.

She has two children, ages 7 and 25.  Her business activity is selling various products from specialized guides or catalogs, which she always watches for sales.  She sells on credit.\r\n\r\nWhen she was very young she worked as an employee.  Later, when she could not find work, her business became the best income alternative to help her family and advance her household.  Her goal for later on is to have a place and to achieve growth in her business. \r\n\r\nHowever, her greatest challenge is not having enough working capital to achieve this goal.  That is the reason that she turns to a Kiva loan, her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy clothes, which she will have ready to deliver to her loyal customers.  The season in which the volume of sales increases is approaching.  That is why Nanis needs to have working capital to respond to this demand.\r\n\r\nWith her previous loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo she bought perfume, creams, and hair care products.  They came in her catalogs with very good discounts.  This was a great opportunity to increase her profits, to have inventory that turned over quickly, and to offer her customers better prices.\r\n\r\nShe is now supporting her son even more with the university expenses.  Her message is one of great gratitude.  She asks God to keep you with this good heart and desire to help.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1331525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes.

","en":"Carlos is 19 years old. He has a small shop selling sodas, drinks, pastries, and also fish and meats. \r\n\r\nCarlos has experience in his family business since he was very small. When his father lost his job, he decided to go work for himself. When he received his severance pay, he invested it in the purchase of freezers and equipment with which he started his business, stocking it little by little. Carlos shares responsibility for manning the shop with his mother from Monday to Sunday from 4:00 in the morning until 8:00 at night. Their sales, as well as their purchases, are done in cash in the community around their neighborhood. \r\n\r\nCarlos's goal for the future is to remodel his business and keep it stocked so that he can continue his education and \"be someone in life,\" as he himself says. He currently needs to put working capital into his business, and that is the reason for taking out a Kiva loan.

Their oldest is 7 years old and is in 2nd grade and their next oldest is 6 and is 1st grade.  Their 3rd child is their 5-year-old daughter, who doesn't go to school.  Their youngest child is in kindergarden.  They all are dependent on her and her spouse.\r\n\r\nNolvia hasn't had any schooling at all, which is why she works hard every day with her husband so the same doesn't happen to their children and they can get an education.\r\n\r\nShe has been a farmer her whole life and learned from her parents (her family has worked in farming for a long time).  Together with her husband, who is in charge of maintaining their coffee crop, they walk daily from their house to their fields, which are located 3 kilometers from their house.\r\n\r\nNolvia is asking for help to buy fertilizer, manure, and other goods to help maintain her coffee crop, since through this income she will be able to ensure her harvest and get the maximum yield out of it.  Her goals are to be able to expand her crop so as to have more income for her home and family.  Her dream is to be able to put her kids through school so they can have a better quality of life, a better education, and progress every day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1331600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy fertilizer, manure, and other supplies to help her grow coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-04-14T03:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-14T03:00:06Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nolvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:09:52Z","rounded_local_amount":20443.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082518}],"funded_date":"2013-04-15T05:53:59Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:09:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":547437,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia is in the retail business and has been running her sari-sari store for 15 years.

He is the second of five brothers and was born in the town of Dr. Arroyo in the south of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico. When he was 11 years old, his parents, who were farmers, emigrated to the city of Monterrey in search of better life opportunities that would allow them to provide for their large family.\r\n\r\nWith his parents' effort, Pedro finished high school; he wasn't able to continue his education because he needed to work and help his parents with household costs. When he was 15 years old, he started as a welder's helper in a welding shop. He remained in that job for five years, a period during which he learned the welding profession. It was then that he decided to set up a small welding shop to do jobs on request for his neighbors and the people in the area. A while later, he had to hire a helper to keep up with the demand of the requested work. \r\n\r\nPedro currently relies on the work of three helpers whom he uses to complete various projects required by builders, but he lacks the necessary materials to finish those projects. So he is requesting a loan with the hope that it will be granted so that he can acquire those materials and make good use of them.  \r\n\r\nPedro lives with his wife, his two children, and his mom, who was widowed several years ago. His greatest commitment is to continue helping his family and his employees.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1331622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married and has five children, all of whom are dependent on Nelly as they are at various stages in their education.  Nelly herself completed primary school bu could not continue to secondary school due to a lack of financial help from her parents, who had very little money.  It was Nelly's parents who, from a very young age, taught her agriculture and how to grow basic grains such as rice, corn and beans.  With her husband and her children (after they have finished school), the family go out to clean and shell the crops at a young age.  Nelly does not own the land she works, but rents it.  This leaves her with a lower profit on the final product at every harvest.  She sells her products in the local area and sells more at the weekends.  She takes advantage of the markets and also the area around her home, selling to neighbours and in the adjoining areas.\r\n\r\nNelly is currently applying for help to buy certified seeds in order to grow a little more on the land that she and her husband rent.

Shee is 53 years old and originally from Comarca Larreynaga, on the outskirts of Le\u00f3n.  She is single and a mother to her 12 year old son who is in school.  Teresa has a grocery store, which she has owned for more than 20 years.  Due to financial circumstances, Teresa was only ever able to complete up to fourth grade of primary school.\r\n\r\nTeresa started working in business 33 years old. Where she lived there were no grocery stores nearby and so the idea of starting her own business came to her.  She saw that she would earn a higher income as she had no competition.  This was Teresa's first business and she did not have anybody's support.  She sold her products out of a room in her home.\r\n\r\nToday Teresa wants to invest in her grocery store so she can offer a variety of products to her customers and earn a higher income.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan to buy rice, sugar, beans, oil, soap, milk, meat, chicken, chlorine and more.  These are the products she needs as she does not stock them.  Teresa thinks the loan will be of great help because she will be able to stock up her business and attract customers.  Thus she will increase her sales and, therefore, her income.  One of her short-term goals is to pay off the loan so that she can apply for another and to help her son do well in

Since 1996, he has been growing onions, wheat, barley, mustard, and sunflowers. His wife helps him with his work. He has 2 children who are 7 and 15 years old. He started out by growing wheat. He has now decided to purchase drip tape for irrigation.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of the family's low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where 100 nut trees and mandarin trees are grown and they sell approximately 300 to 350 kg. of nuts and 150 kg. of mandarin seasonally. It is hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBeka requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Beka will purchase a milking cow. After purchasing a milking cow, Beka\u2019s wife will produce dairy products and the family will get an additional source of income.

He is Alimahmad, a 26-year-old man from Tajikistan. He is married to a wonderful woman named Saisoro, and they have 1 child who is 1 year old. For the last 3 years, Alimahmad has been growing such crops as potatoes, wheat, carrots, and so on. He sells his harvest at the market, where his produce is in demand due to its high quality.

He lives in Zestaponi district with his 43-year-old wife, two sons and retired mother. Jaba has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time due to his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nJaba is a tinsmith worker. He fixes damaged cars (repairing the car body) on private orders and earns a small monthly salary. His family also has a milk cow and owns a vineyard. They use the cow for milk to make cheese. With the harvested grapes, Jaba makes vodka, which is sold together with the cheese locally at the markets. \r\n\r\nJaba has requested a loan from Credo to start-up his family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Jaba will purchase an old damaged car. He already has some savings and needs this loan to add to the amount that he has. After buying a damaged car he will fix it himself and then sell it at a higher price. As he is already experienced in this field Jaba hopes he will earn a good profit to reinvest in the same business and buy more cars.

","en":"Saymurod is an intelligent and hard-working man. He is 22 years old, single, and lives with his parents. He has an older brother with whose help he started his own retail business 2 years ago. He has his own shop in the city center where he sells household goods. Every day he gets up at dawn and goes to work in the early morning with the goal of making the day a successful one and having a lot of customers come to his store. Sometimes he makes a lot of sales, and sometimes he doesn't. Because his shop is downtown, he has a lot of competition. He has to expand the range of goods he sells in order to attract more customers. However, his store is small and there is not enough room. Saymurod is seeking a loan to buy the premises that are next to his shop so he can expand his business and increase his income. He is asking for 3,000 US dollars for that purpose. He is waiting for your kindness.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1330658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy premises to expand his shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kumsangir","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.412778 68.684444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-04-14T14:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-14T14:20:11Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saymurod","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":218.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":219.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":231.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":233.04},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":239.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":246.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":248.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":261.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":264.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":270.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":280.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":286.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":261.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":264.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":286.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":765.88,"local_amount":765.88,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":765.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915701},{"amount":233.74,"local_amount":233.74,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":233.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693393},{"amount":244.95,"local_amount":244.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":244.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556205},{"amount":248.27,"local_amount":248.27,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":248.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550047},{"amount":254.73,"local_amount":254.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":254.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410959024},{"amount":262.08,"local_amount":262.08,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075178},{"amount":266.13,"local_amount":266.13,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":266.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430227875},{"amount":276.53,"local_amount":276.53,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":276.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439988873},{"amount":447.69,"local_amount":447.69,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":447.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449625820}],"funded_date":"2013-05-11T19:13:18Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T11:05:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":547530,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 45 years old and married.

She has three children who are 8, 5 and 19 years old. She sells a variety of products. This business is going well for her. This loan is her first with the institution. Patricia lives in the locality of Tiquipaya where basic services and water are scarce. The majority of the time, water is bought from the water wagons that offer water in each area for a modest price. Therefore, she is requesting this loan to construct a bathroom with a water tank, in order to be able to have a water reserve, since one of the principal reasons for the construction of a water tank is to store and distribute the water along with the construction of water pipes that lead to the bathroom, shower and kitchen. This is of great utility, since the water wagons come by once a week and her family is often without water and this basic element is essential in every home. With the construction of this bath, Patricia will greatly improve their quality of life, which is why she is grateful for this opportunity provided to

On the land that she and her husband acquired when very young, relatives get together as good workers in order to obtain excellent quality to recover the capital invested. \r\n\r\nHer main disadvantage at the beginning was not having enough capital to plant cocoa on all the land, which is why her financial growth was so small as years went by.\r\n\r\nShe wants over time to buy additional land and begin to grow muellin since the quality of land she has guarantees a good harvest of this product. This becomes her first loan granted through Kiva and she appreciates the confidence offered and she is committed to making her payments on time.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for 3,000 soles to hire workers at the site.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1331774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire workers for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-14T19:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-14T19:00:04Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":329.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":329.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":362.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":374.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":373.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":398.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":411.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":420.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":329.83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":333.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530378},{"amount":128.87,"local_amount":329.03,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":332.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975406},{"amount":141.9,"local_amount":362.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":365.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996673},{"amount":146.56,"local_amount":374.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":377.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864155},{"amount":146.11,"local_amount":373.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":376.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352521},{"amount":156.19,"local_amount":398.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":402.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904342},{"amount":161.33,"local_amount":411.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":416.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090440},{"amount":164.86,"local_amount":420.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":425.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777244}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T17:38:24Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":547596,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia lives in Kisauni.
