He is married and has one child. For the past year, Adam has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells soap, sugar, milk and bread. To help expand his business, Adam has applied for a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more items, such as rice, maize flour and soda, to sell, and it will help Adam to generate greater profits and enable him to sell more goods, due to his increased stock. His profits will increase, and he will pay his medical bills. Adam hopes that, in the future, he will be able to expand his shop into a mini supermarket. Adam is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs such as Adam, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but who have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1330627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more items, such as rice, maize flour and soda, to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mityana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.4175 32.022778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-04-14T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-14T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":204143},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":211516},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":219156},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":227072},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":235273},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":243771},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":252576},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":261699},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":271151},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":280945},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":291092},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":301606}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.96,"local_amount":204143,"processed_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-22T08:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":205821.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364880377},{"amount":82.84,"local_amount":211516,"processed_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T08:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":213255.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372886120},{"amount":85.84,"local_amount":219156,"processed_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-24T08:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":220958.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381908551},{"amount":88.93,"local_amount":227072,"processed_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-27T08:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":228939.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391396881},{"amount":92.15,"local_amount":235273,"processed_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":237207.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399776423},{"amount":95.48,"local_amount":243771,"processed_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-28T08:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":245775.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411560677},{"amount":98.92,"local_amount":252576,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":254653.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420923602},{"amount":366.46,"local_amount":935634,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":943328.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429470222},{"amount":109.49,"local_amount":279546,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":281844.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449600544},{"amount":74.93,"local_amount":191313,"processed_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":192886.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467878992}],"funded_date":"2013-04-24T12:49:54Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:15:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":547623,"name":"Mwaka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwaka is a married woman.

Jose's son is his biggest motivation in life. Jose is a very kind, hardworking, and enthusiastic person. He and his wife dedicate themselves completely to helping their family get ahead. Unfortunately, due to scarce economic resources, he had to begin working at an early age and was not able to study Auto Mechanics like he hoped to. \r\n\r\nIn his free time, Jose likes to play soccer with his friends and, on special occasions, he cooks the delicious Carapulcra con Sopa Seca (a traditional Peruvian dish) to share with his family. \r\n\r\nBy his own initiative and with much dedication and determination, Jose works in an agricultural business in his city. He works 10-hour days in the fields and also runs his own small business raising and selling guinea pigs.

This direct hit to his finances affected his ability to buy school supplies, construction materials for his home, and food so that his family could eat.  To rectify this problem, Victor is requesting a loan in order to buy seeds (onions and carrots), agrochemicals, and organic fertilizer.  This will enable him to generate more income that will improve his quality of life and stabilize his family\u2019s finances.  As a result, they can resume their path to prosperity.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1322859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds (onions and carrots), agrochemicals, and organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2013-04-14T22:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-14T22:40:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":362.52,"local_amount":2500.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399793152},{"amount":362.48,"local_amount":2499.89,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459081807}],"funded_date":"2013-04-19T01:05:58Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:08:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":547605,"name":"Farhat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farhat is a 32-year-old hard working housewife.

She lives in the municipality of Juarez, Nuevo Leon, to the east of the metropolitan area.  Matilde now has a salon in the front of her home, which she built with a lot of sacrifice.  She has been working as a hair stylist for more than 4 years; however, she had not been able to establish herself in a more formal business due to various circumstances.  But today, thanks to the support of her husband, she has managed to build a salon, which will allow her to continue with her plans to grow her business.  In addition, she is studying in the field of education, which is allowing her to develop in another area.\r\n\r\nMatilde comments that she has achieved all of this thanks to some loans that she has taken from Credituyo.  This new loan will help her to make some repairs to her roof, improving the appearance of her business.  She will also buy some furniture and blinds so that she can have a place that is more cool and comfortable, particularly during the seasons when it is hot.\r\n\r\nMatilde comments that one of her dreams is to be able to have 2 or 3 beauticians so that she can generate a source of employment.  This would allow her to devote herself to teaching, enabling her to help people in another way.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1332047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to make some repairs to her salon: finish the walls and waterproof the roof","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Monterrey","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"25.666667 -100.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2013-04-15T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-15T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matilde Rosa Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10580.02,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":895.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":955.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1018.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1086.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1159.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1236.71},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1319.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1407.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1501.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.17,"local_amount":895.48,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":919.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372914087},{"amount":81.26,"local_amount":955.21,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":981.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381691794},{"amount":86.68,"local_amount":1018.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390794240},{"amount":92.45,"local_amount":1086.88,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1116.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399803622},{"amount":98.63,"local_amount":1159.38,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:27:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1191.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410079721},{"amount":105.2,"local_amount":1236.71,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-13T09:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419846186},{"amount":112.22,"local_amount":1319.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-05T10:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1355.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429495165},{"amount":119.7,"local_amount":1407.19,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-03T09:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1445.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439719309},{"amount":127.69,"local_amount":1501.05,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-09T09:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1542.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459091916}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T03:03:12Z","paid_date":"2014-09-09T09:46:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":547643,"name":"Priscille's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cMugambimwiza\u201d is a word meaning \u201cgood plan\u201d in English.

She is the daughter of an entrepreneurial couple, she is happy, and with much faith in God. Andrea is the second daughter from this happy marriage. She had a happy childhood and did very well in high school. This couple has been together for 24 years, and this has shown that love will always triumph. At 18 years old, she values her parents very much, and also the hard work and morals they have taught her, and also the good example they have provided. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago she finished her high school degree. She graduated with honors and it was a very good experience. She has wonderful memories of each of her friends. She has left her mark on the lives of many people. Her charisma and the fact she is a good person have made an impression on her teachers. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing high school, she didn\u2019t have the resources to attend university. However, her mother, through a lot of hard work and dedication, was able to provide her with a few English classes, which she was very successful in. After that, she made the decision to start working during the December holidays. Things went very well for her, but for reasons that are not relevant here, she became unemployed. With the support of her family, she has decided to become a student again. She took a look at the situation in which she finds herself. Nineteen years ago, her father developed diabetes, which has caused degeneration of his body, and because of this he lost his sight. He has also developed damage to his kidneys, such that he has to go for dialysis every three days. From that time, her mother took charge of the household and became the source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nAndrea wants very much to finish her studies. She is aware that she will be able to do this, with God\u2019s help. She is sure that over the long run, she will achieve her goal of becoming an orthodontist, but for now she will study Cooking Teqnique in the institution. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of preparing something delicious and special for someone famous or someone that is very special for her. She hopes to take the classes and finish them so she can get ahead and help support her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1331989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finish her studies in Cooking.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-15T02:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-15T02:50:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.71,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-21T08:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":156428.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365197723},{"amount":74.29,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":135571.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891051},{"amount":240,"local_amount":420000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":438000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912459}],"funded_date":"2013-04-15T06:15:53Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":548561,"name":"Silvia Yanira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Silvia,  solicita un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo por la necesidad de invertir en la producci\u00f3n de granos b\u00e1sicos.

He is married and is raising 9 children. He has been raising livestock for over 20 years. He has a large homestead, since raising 9 children requires a lot of resources. He is the most honest and hardworking business man at the local market. He sells his animals to butchers and others. Thanks to his tireless work he has his own loyal customers. Jura is planning to further develop his business, so he is asking for a loan in order to buy animals. He is asking for a 1100 USD loan.

","en":"Nigina is a hard working and intelligent woman. She is 29 years old, married, and has a child. Her husband is a migrant worker in Russia who sends money home. Nigina also works, as she has been a dressmaker for over six years. She works out of her home, sewing traditional dresses for women and children. She also sews curtains to order for houses and offices. She tries to please her clients with high quality tailoring of the clothes and curtains she makes. The money her husband sends is not enough to provide the family with everything it needs, so Nigina needs to expand her business and earn a higher income. She needs a new sewing machine, and also fabric for making more of the traditional dresses. She is asking for a 5000 TJS loan to buy a sewing machine and fabric. She promises that as an honest person, she will repay the loan on time. She appreciates your kindness.

Her husband is a teacher at the town's middle school. Her children are grown, have their own work and help Ortikjon run the business. The youngest son teaches at the university. Ortikjon and her children have been raising animals and raising crops such as corn, barley, and other grains, for over 10 years. A few years ago two of her sons married, and after the weddings they were left without animals since they sold everything to pay for the wedding festivities. It was very hard to live without milk, kefir, and butter. But the family addressed the hardship with the help of a loan. This year they bought two more hectares of land, and now own a total of six hectares. Ortikjon and her children want to plant on all six hectares. She is asking for a 5000 TJS loan for the purchase of seeds and fertilizer. She appreciates your kindness.

Her husband is a businessman, and Zulfiya herself teaches the youngest grade at a middle school. Zulfiya is a very good teacher and is skilled at her work. She is also a dressmaker. She works tirelessly and always seeks her clients' satisfaction. A few years ago Zulfiya and her husband began building a new house since their home is very old and does not meet standard conditions. This year they want to do the roof, but don't have enough money. Zulfiya is asking for a loan of 10000 TJS to buy slate and wood. She appreciates your kindness. This loan will help Zulfiya finish the house and in doing so, improve her living conditions.

She lives with her long-term partner and their three children in a simple structure, located in a rural community in the city of La Romana. Specifically, the community is a batey (company town) founded for sugarcane workers.\r\n\r\nMargarita says that her most important challenge is to have her own house and to raise her children providing their own safe home and all their needs. She operates a fruits and vegetables stall, a place where she sells goods to make daily income for food. This is a small stall in front of her house selling the most favored vegetables like plantains, cassava, potatoes, and veggies for salad.

Many of the members are selling goods like bread, clothing, shoes or cosmetics. Others sell seafood, run fried food stalls and other businesses.\r\n\r\nJanira lives together with her long-term partner and her child. She is running a bakery where she sells bread. She started her business around seven years ago. She has been investing every loan to increase her sales and to buy different gadgets. This is her 12th loan. She said that her most difficult challenge has been to establish her business, but she has made it possible to sell bread to her community and others nearby.

","en":"Gavharoi is a female shepherd. She is great at raising cattle, sheep, and goats. As there was no son in her family, Gavharoi helped her father raise livestock as a child. Now the skills that she gained and her father's lessons have become Gavharoi's main source of income. Additionally, she works on a dehkan farm, where she gets her family's daily vegetables, greens, and fruit. Hence, her animal husbandry work has been bringing in her family's \"daily bread\" for 30 years. Due to time constraints associated with her finances, Gavharoi decided to turn to a loan. She has entrusted her future income and material well-being to MDO \"Arvand\". She wants to purchase cattle and cattle feed with the loan. She thanks MDO \"Arvand\" in advance for the assistance.

","en":"Shahlo is a humble, hard-working, and determined woman. She was born in a rural area and has significant experience in animal husbandry and crop farming. She had a difficult childhood because her father never had permanent work. \r\n\r\nShahlo's husband went to Russia to find work and she works as a cleaning lady in a school. Additionally, she started working in animal husbandry five months ago. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of improving her skill set, Shahlo took the course \"Bring It On\", led by the Business Women's Association and IMON International. She learned many interesting things including how to make her own business plan. However, her family currently has financial problems. \r\n\r\nShahlo is planning for her daughter to go to university, but she doesn't have enough money. She has to earn the money for her daughter's education and still support her family. She is requesting a 5000 som loan for purchasing cattle to start her new business. She is waiting on your kindness!

She wasn't able to get a university education. Hence, she was left without a trade. \r\n\r\nAfter marrying, Nazira's life became very difficult. She had children and her husband had a very small salary. Some days there was nothing for her and her children to eat. \r\n\r\nThen, she found out about a course called \"Bring It On\", organized by the Business Women's Association. She got a certificate from the course and now has the skills to work in business. She is planning to start her own animal trade business. She is requesting a loan of 1500 American dollars to purchase cattle.

or drop the 7-year-old catering business, R&B Kitchens? Weary of working as a cook at other restaurants, Robert seized the opportunity and took charge of the family business.\r\n  \r\nIn addition to his mother\u2019s teaching, Robert had honed his skills by attending culinary school. As a former chef for different restaurants, Robert said he wanted to be in charge and create food his way, but he always deferred to the head chefs, so he didn\u2019t have the freedom he sought. So, his taking over the family business was a win for both his parents and Robert.\r\n \r\nNow in charge of the El Paso business, R&B Kitchens, Robert says his plan is to expand the catering business by adding soul food to the Cajun menu, as well as adding a restaurant. His mother, whom he credits as the foundation for the family\u2019s cooking talents, will cook alongside his father and sister at the restaurant.\r\n \r\nWhile out shopping for restaurant equipment, Robert ran into an Accion Texas Inc. loan officer, who invited him to her office. After getting approved, Robert used his loan to buy supplies, as well as tables, chairs and shelves to remodel an older restaurant. Robert says with the loan, he was able to replace old wall tiles and repair mirrors.\r\n \r\nHad he not received his Accion loan, Robert said he and his family would have had to have waited at least another month to open, since all they had to invest in the new restaurant was $500.\r\n \r\nWithin the next four months, Robert plans to hire more employees and establish a

Isroil and his family live in a remote area where the main source of income is animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops. For the last 20 years, he and his brothers Ismoil and Elior have been earning their living by raising cattle and growing crops. Isroil grows wheat, corn, and so on. His wife and two of his sons help him with his work. They sell their rich harvest to local citizens and also take it to the central market of the region to be sold. For many years, he has had problems with water supply, and for this reason, he has decided to build a well. Once he builds it, all his problems will be easily solved. Isroil is seeking a loan of 15,000 Tajikistan Somoni to purchase pipe to start construction on a well. He is waiting for your kindness. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":1331371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy pipe to build a well","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-04-15T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-15T13:50:03Z","loan_amount":3150,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isroil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2268.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2414.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2453.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2525.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2633.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2705.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":476.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":507.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":530.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":552.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.07,"local_amount":0.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":0.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693402},{"amount":1803.69,"local_amount":8589,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8596.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075188},{"amount":1346.24,"local_amount":6410.63,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6416.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439988880}],"funded_date":"2013-04-19T08:26:25Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:11:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":548044,"name":"Somaly's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Somaly, 20, lives in a rural area of the Moung Russey district of Battambang province and she is married with one daughter.

","en":"Naimkul was born in the countryside, far away from the city. His village is near the mountains. He mainly earns his living with his profession, which is running private construction sites. He also runs the household. He is raising four teenaged children together with his wife Mahfiratom. It is difficult for them to provide for their kids, since Naimknul is the family's only provider. During the construction season Naimknul earns an income in the village. During the winter he mostly takes care of the livestock. He has turned to IMON for the first time.

Chamshed also does some farming; he has a small plot of land. But his primary source of income is from raising cattle. His wife helps him take care of the cattle in her free time.\n\nRight now Chamshed needs feed for the animals, for there is little grass in the mountains.

in a village not far from a city.  He's single and lives with his parents.  In 2010, he finished high school but because of financial limitations, he did not continue into higher education even though he finished school strongly.  Juraboy's parents are experiencing financial hardship because of their large family.  His parents need to get everyone on their feet.  Juraboy has been working in trade, selling men's clothing, for a year.  He buys his clothing in another city at low prices.  In the beginning, things were difficult because he didn't have any previous, relevant experience.  He hopes to overcome all obstacles and become self-reliant. Juraboy has goals, just like everyone does.  He wants to save money and study at university.  He wants to be able to work in a specialized field.  However, helping his family comes first.  \n\nRelatives recommended he take out a loan from Arvand.  With these funds, he wants to buy an assortment of men's clothing to increase turnover.

It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nSopio requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start up loan program envisages provision of business start ups and re-startups with credits for soft conditions to the country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Sopio will open her own flower shop.

She lives in the capital city of Georgia, Tbilisi, with her husband and son. Tina requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTina has rented commercial space inside the big local market. She is baking pastries, and bringing them out and selling them to get a small daily income. Her husband is working as a security guard on a small salary. The family\u2019s total income is rarely enough for food and covering the household expenses.  \r\n\r\nTina requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tina will purchase a draft beer machine, flour and sausages to have more variety of food.

By buying these supplies to make different types of bread, the bakery will make more sales and as a result her income will increase. In this way she can satisfy the neighborhood demand. \r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to buy an industrial oven which runs on electricity so she can bake more bread since in winter she can only bake once a day because of the rain.

He has had his own business in a busy market in the capital for 17 years.  He works seven days a week, with his best sales on the weekend because his business is located in the terminal for the buses that go to the northern part of the country.  His wife works in the business; his daughter helps them in the morning and attends school in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe's requesting a loan to invest in buying merchandise, which he buys in accordance with the seasons of the year.  Right now he's going to invest in summer clothing and a variety of merchandise to stock his business.  The success of Santos's business is to keep it well stocked to sell merchandise to his customers.\r\n\r\nSantos is grateful to Kiva and CEPRODEL for the loans granted because they have allowed him to grow in his business and consequently increase his profits and support his family.  He pays for his children's education and little by little he has improved his house, because his business is his family's only source of income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1327551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"to

He has a three year old son and lives with his small family in a home that he bought from his aunt and uncle for a good price because he was young and a hard worker.  He has plantations and raises organic cacao, palillo (similar to the guava-tree), and coffee.  He works on the land he acquired with Esther, through the fruits of his labor in the first year as a couple.  At first he had some financial problems because he was so young, however after a few years he showed that age is not an obstacle to getting ahead.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a more fluid campaign he needs to be able to count on working capital so that he can hire workers from the area so that he can speed up the farm work such as weeding and harvesting the cocoa pods.  In order to improve his income in the future, he plans to start selling clothing and put his wife to work in this way, which is easier than working in the fields.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan through Kiva and he is very grateful for the opportunity and is committed to making his payments on time.  He would like a loan of 3,000 PEN so that he can replace the existing columns in his home with solid cement columns, hoping to improve his quality of life and his family\u2019s wellbeing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1331743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to make home repairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-16T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-16T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":329.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":329.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":362.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":374.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":373.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":398.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":411.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":420.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":329.83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":333.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530377},{"amount":128.87,"local_amount":329.03,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":332.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975405},{"amount":141.9,"local_amount":362.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":365.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996672},{"amount":146.56,"local_amount":374.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":377.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864154},{"amount":146.11,"local_amount":373.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":376.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352520},{"amount":156.19,"local_amount":398.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":402.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904341},{"amount":161.33,"local_amount":411.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":416.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090439},{"amount":164.86,"local_amount":420.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":425.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777243}],"funded_date":"2013-04-19T16:26:21Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She is living in a remote area of Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Her husband, who is an automotive mechanic by profession, is the only person earning money in the family, but his income is not enough to fulfill the basic needs of his family. Therefore to contribute, and to support her husband, Noreen wants to generate some income by sewing clothes. She already has excellent experience from doing this for a year. Noreen has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a sewing machine to start her business.
