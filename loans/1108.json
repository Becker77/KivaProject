She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan along with her husband, two daughters, and a son. Her husband is a government employee, but his income is insufficient to meet the household expenses. Both of her children are studying in government schools.\r\n\r\nSaima is an efficient beautician by profession. Since 2006, she has been operating her own beauty salon. Currently, the beauty stock of the salon is almost finished. Therefore, Saima wants to purchase cosmetic products to continue her business. For that, as a member of a 2-person lending group, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase beauty products like facial creams, lipsticks, scrubs, makeup kits, hair colours, and some other variety of products. She would also buy some new chairs for her salon. With the profits, she will pay the installments of the loan and school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of living a happy, healthy, and peaceful life with her family.

Leone. This group of teachers has come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to apply for a loan of 7,000,000 SLL for the entire team. With the help of this loan, these teachers can meet their immediate financial challenges and at the end of each month, they can make their loan payments using their monthly salaries.\r\n\r\nKomba is the featured leader of this group.

Her loan request was rejected every time because of her husband\u2019s low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\nDodo then requested a 1200 USD start-up loan from Credo. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisions providing start-up and re-startup loans with easy terms to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as high-risk borrowers due to low incomes. \r\n<p>\r\nWith her loan Dodo will begin trading in used clothing.

26, lives in the village of Ikalto in Telavi district with her husband, Zurab. The family owns a vineyard where Zurab grows grapes to make wine and vodka, which is sold at local markets. This is the only source of income for the family and is not enough to cover their monthly expenses. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n<p>\r\nNatruli requested a 2000 GEL start-up loan from Credo. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisions providing start-up and re-startup loans with easy terms to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as high-risk borrowers due to low incomes. \r\n<p>\r\nWith her loan Natruli will buy clothes at wholesale, then sell them at retail in her village. Natruli is a very hardworking woman and will try her best to make her new business work. Part of her profits she will use for reinvesting and purchasing more clothes to develop her trade. The other part will be used to help cover monthly expenses and provide better living conditions for the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1331530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To buy clothes at wholesale and sell them at retail prices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ikalto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-16T18:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-16T18:40:01Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natruli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":134.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":147.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":152.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":155.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":159.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":165.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":168.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":173.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":177.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":182.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":188.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":192.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.63,"local_amount":134.91,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":136.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969157},{"amount":90.25,"local_amount":147.34,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":149.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749575},{"amount":93.62,"local_amount":152.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":154.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613483},{"amount":95.24,"local_amount":155.5,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":157.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857202},{"amount":97.84,"local_amount":159.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":161.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133854},{"amount":101.16,"local_amount":165.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":167.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107441},{"amount":103.24,"local_amount":168.56,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254993},{"amount":561.02,"local_amount":915.95,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":926.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019146}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T20:41:56Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":548369,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is 45 years old and lives in  Margibi county, which is the largest rubber-producing region in Liberia.

Due to his hard work, Sahak's farm is one of the best farms in the whole village. He would like to enlarge his farming business but unfortunately does not currently have sufficient financial means. So he has requested a loan to purchase fertilizer, forage to feed the livestock and fuel to transport the harvest to the market. The loan is very important for Sahak to continue the expansion of his farm and earn more agricultural income, income which is vital for him to sustain his family (pictured in the

She belongs to Janlai Lengnu group. One can check the group link here:  http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lend\/484282 . Pi Neilam told her about the lenders on Kiva and how they were funded for their business. Therefore, Hatneineng decided to join a group with her other friends who are economically active. They formed the Zion SHG group and became a part of WSDS.\r\n \r\nHatneineng rents a place in the town market and she runs a garment-selling business. She has been in this business for more than three years. She is a competent and determined businesswoman. She always wanted to stand on her own feet and be successful in what she did.  Since she has been running the business for so long, she has a lot of customers who she values, so she tries her best to supply them with what they order. She also wanted to sell garments on credit but she could not facilitate her customers with that service because of her limited capital. She was not aware of the presence of Microfinance institute in the state and used to believe that taking loans would instead become a burden with the interest. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she hopes to expand her garment business and she is determined to pay back the loan on time. Hatneineng says that with the loan, she wishes to buy more garments for selling and gradually expand her business.  She wants to utilize the loan by purchasing different garments for all age groups and make a good profit. The rest of the group members are doing different businesses like a piggery, poultry, weaving, a tea stall and a dukan.

She has seven children and has been doing this work for 16 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is 'feeding and milking dairy cows!'  Her biggest challenge is, \"shortage of animal pasture during dry seasons and diseases\". Animals on the farm have been given the names of  Maua and Samoo. She will use the loan of 62,400 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nViolet was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"Because it gives loans to farmers at a lower interest rate.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. She replied, \"They are short term loans given by microfinance institutions to farmers and businessmen.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Violet replied, \"The income from the sale of milk will help me educate my children and expand my other businesses.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Violet owns cows and poultry but does not own pigs, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, solar power, and a sewing machine but does not have electricity, running water, TV or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

Mauna is one of them. The lady standing second from right with her hand raised is Mauna. She is 45 years of age and a very hardworking lady living with her husband, one son aged 24, and one daughter aged 20.who have, after finishing 10th standard schooling, been helping their parents.\r\n \r\nMauna has been running a dairy farm with five buffalos for the last 12 years. Her husband and son help her in nurturing the buffalos and the milk supply. The primary work of Mauna is to clean the buffalo shed every morning and keep the shed clean. Mauna gets 15 liters of milk daily and supplies it to a sweet stall in a nearby town. She gets payment from the stall owner on a weekly basis. Apart from the milk, she also extracts cheese, curd and ghee from the milk, which fetches extra income for her. Mauna earns a monthly net income of 6,000 Indian Rupees (INR) but it is not sufficient to manage her household expenses along with the fodder expenses for her buffalos. Therefore, to earn some extra income, Mauna has planned to utilize the present loan to purchase another two buffalos of an improved variety. Mauna has a dream of saving some money for the marriage of her daughter and son and  to construct a house. The other four members are Sabitri, Sudha, Puspanjali and Sudhansubala and they are have businesses like a dairy farm, a fancy store, and a general grocery shop, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1332018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing two buffalos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"LACHHIPUR, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudhansubala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mauna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":180000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T17:05:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":548911,"name":"Diakalia","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur  DIAKALIA est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 35 ans et vit avec son \u00e9pouse dans la sous pr\u00e9fecture de Ouelessebougou, R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro.\nDIAKALIA n\u2019a pas eu la chance  d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole.

She has two small children whom she raises with a lot of love. She lives with them in her parents' house, and she works hard everyday so that she'll give the best of herself in order to get ahead. Diana's business consists of selling snacks such as cookies, candy, bubble gum and lollipops. She usually makes traveling sales on weekends, in front of clubs or parties being held in town. Aside from that, she has a small stand located in her parents' house. She's very well-known because of her sense of humor and charisma, which has caused her sales to result in the profits she needs. She has been in this business for about five years, although at first she felt like she was too shy for this line of work. In time she was able to build up her qualities and now she sells a lot, which she's very happy about. What she enjoys the most about her work is talking to the customers and making them laugh. She believes that the hardest part is having to sell under the heavy morning sunlight.

It is a group comprising of four women members (two members from the Hindu community and two members from the Muslim community) from the hamlet of Fokat Pada in the village of Gadramunda. The specialty of this hamlet is that all the inhabitants were landless and the government provided them with small patches of land free of cost to construct house for residential purposes.  It is located in the Nuapada district, one of the poorest districts of India. One of the members of this group is Chandrika who is standing second from left with her hand raised in the photo. She is an energetic lady of 32 years whose family consists of her husband, two daughters of 15 and 11 years and one son of 13 years. The elder daughter of Chandrika has already married, the second daughter is studying in class 9 and her son is studying in class 7. \r\n\r\nChandrika has been running a bakery factory in her house with the help of her husband. Her husband started the business 20 years ago with a small investment of his own. In the factory, bakery items like bread, roll, cream and toast etc. are being prepared. She has engaged four skilled laborers for processing and making the bakery items for which she has to pay daily from 100 \u2013 135 INR plus breakfast and lunch. Her husband also works in the factory. She supplies the products to retailers in nearby villages and vendors also regularly take the products from her. Chandrika says owing to better quality, design, packing and forms of her products, there is a lot of demand from the locals, but due to a shortage of stock she can not meet their demands. Chandrika earns a monthly net profit of 8,000 INR, which is not sufficient to maintain the family expenses, educational expenses of her children and business expenses like payments to the laborers etc. To increase the income, Chandrika wants to buy more stock of oil, dough, sugar etc. to increase her production level to meet the demands and grab her customers. So Chandrika is planning to use the present loan for purchasing raw materials in bulk, which will reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, and for making a new kiln. She also hopes to save money from the sale proceeds to provide a better education facility to her children and construct a new house. \r\n\r\nThe other three active members of the group are Fatma, Mumataj and Mangala who are doing mutton, fancy items and a vending business, respectively, hoping to provide better education to their children and increase their living standard.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1332027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for oil, dough, sugar etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Gadramunda,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phatama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mumataj","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mangala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":136000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":136000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T22:40:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":549107,"name":"Lauro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LAURO\nEl se\u00f1or Lauro es un se\u00f1or muy trabajador, la cual se dedica a la plantaci\u00f3n y venta de rosas naturales e injertadas.

Lilabati is one of them. The smiling lady of 41 years standing at the extreme right in the photo and raising her hand is Lilabati. \r\n\r\nLilabati lives with her husband and two daughters, aged 15 and 13 years. Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day.  Her elder daughter is studying +2 science, and the younger daughter is studying in ninth standard.\r\n\r\nLilabati has been running a general grocery shop in her locality for the last five years. This is the only source of income for her family. She started the business in a very low-profile manner with a small investment of her own. At that time, her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR. It was very difficult for Lilabati to maintain her family and meet the educational and other expenses. \r\n\r\nAfter formation of the group, Lilabati took the first loan of 10,000 INR and purchased some grocery items like potatoes, onions, oil, sugar, tea dust, etc. After six months, her business started its growth, and simultaneously her income was also increased manifold. With her second loan of 25,000 INR, Lilabati again purchased some more items, and customers started knowing her business better. With the third loan of 30,000 INR, she added a shelf to her grocery shop and made a counter table with glass to have a good look, which will attract the customers and thereby increase sales. \r\n\r\nDuring this period, Lilabati did an innovative idea by motivating a lady to start a tiffin center (lunches or lunches-to-go) adjoining her shop, so that she could sell oil, sugar, dough, potatoes, etc. regularly. This idea of Lilabati\u2019s was materialized, and she earned some extra income. \r\n\r\nLilabati\u2019s husband actively helps and supplements her business. Within a short span, Lilabati successfully was able to increase the monthly income level from 2,000 to 7,000 INR. Out of this, she was able to send her elder daughter to the capital city of Odisha (Bhubaneswar) for studying +2 science. \r\n\r\nAs per her statement, Lilabati was able to increase the variety of items in her shop, but not the inventory. She wants to increase the stock of raw materials. So, according to Lilabati, a portion of the present loan amount will be used to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc. for her general store, and the other portion will be used for extension and repairing of the storeroom.

Kwale County is located on the Kenyan coast and borders Tanzania to the south. \r\n\r\nInconsistent rainfalls make farming difficult and contribute to the area's high poverty rates. Despite the unreliable rainfall, bees in the region have two excellent sources of food: wild mangrove forest and local passion fruit plantations. Bee-keeping is relatively new to the area, but many farmers are very interested in owning hives. \r\n\r\nFrancis is unmarried, and has been farming for three years.

Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,248,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. Alpha requires a loan in order to buy different sizes of tires needed by his customers. In the future, Alpha plans to educate his children, buy a vehicle, buy machines for his business and build a house. This loan will help to improve his business. He is a committed and hardworking business man. He thanks you for your generosity towards the business people in his country and thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1332099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy different sized used tires for his tire store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alpha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":517166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862125},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":517166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381630739},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":517166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390494563},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":517166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399742740},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":517166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410012907},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":517166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419775972}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T12:48:59Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:11:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C Pettersen"}},{"id":548626,"name":"Selesitina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selesitina is 49 years old and married with 4 children.

The one standing extreme left with raised hand in the photo is Jasobanti. She is a 37-year-old married lady, living with her husband, one daughter aged 17, and one son aged 15 who are continuing their studies. Jasobanti herself has been running a fancy-item store in Muniguda for the last two years.  Her husband has also been running a fancy-item vending business for the last 12 years. He moves four days in a week to the local weekly markets to sell his fancy items. \r\n\r\nJasobanti sells items like bangles, talc, nail polish, clips, combs, mirrors, face cream, ribbons, etc. She says there is a lot of demand as it is a huge market with almost 40 villages depending on this market and that she does not have enough stock to meet the demand. She does not like saying \u201cNo\u201d to her customers and wants to be able to give the best service to her customers. She now wants to buy more stock of what she is selling like bangles, talc, nail polish, clips, combs, mirrors, face cream, ribbons, etc. to increase her inventory level to be able to meet the demand and seize the business opportunity. \r\n\r\nOver the period of four years Jasobanti has been able to add some assets like a TV and a bed and do some house repairs from her income. The present loan amount will be utilized by her to purchase increased stock in bulk which will reduce her buying costs. She hopes to save enough from her increased revenues for her daughter's wedding and construction of a house for her family.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of her group are Gurubari, Budu, Laxmi, Tunu and Tulasi with fish selling, fancy-item vending, fish selling, Tiffin centre (tearoom), leaf plate making & sweet making businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1332041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing bangles, talc, nail polish, clips, combs, mirrors, face cream, ribbons, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"B.gurubari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Budu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tunu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tulasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jasobanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":84000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T19:45:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":548585,"name":"Trinath Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Trinath is a Joint Liability Group formed in the year 2010 by six active women entrepreneurs of Titilagarh town of Bolangir district in Odisha, India to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing business.

Es soltera y tiene un hijo de 2 a\u00f1os quien se ha convertido en la raz\u00f3n para seguir adelante sin dejarse derivar por los obst\u00e1culos. Vive con su hijo y su hermana Rosa, quien trabaja como empleada privada, en la ciudad de Atuntaqui de la provincia de Imbabura en  el norte del Ecuador.  Un lugar que goza de muchos lugares hist\u00f3ricos que ofrecer a quienes le visitan adem\u00e1s de una deliciosa gastronom\u00eda que es la favorita de  muchos en el pa\u00eds. Otra actividad que es muy conocida en este cant\u00f3n es la textil, pues el dise\u00f1o de ropa industrial y artesanal se ha convertido en una actividad que aporta al crecimiento sostenido de la ciudad por lo que las prendas elaboradas son preferidas por su diferente calidad y dise\u00f1os a nivel nacional e internacional. Cuenta con un clima agradable que es seco y templado lo que ayuda mantener sus tierras f\u00e9rtiles y por lo tanto aptas para el cultivo de cereales y legumbres. Por todas estas oportunidades existentes en la ciudad, Atuntaqui es considerado un centro productivo importante para el Ecuador, m\u00e9rito que no fuese posible sin la fuerza y esp\u00edritu emprendedor de sus habitantes que a la vez generan plazas de trabajo para las familias de la Provincia.\nLourdes hace un a\u00f1o emprendi\u00f3 con su negocio de venta de \u201csalchipapas\u201d una comida r\u00e1pida que tiene papas y salchichas fritas y que son muy demandadas por j\u00f3venes y adultos.

","en":"Lourdes, 22, grew up in a low-income family so she finished elementary school.  She started working at a very young age helping at home, and learned several jobs that she currently gets by on.  She's single and has a two-year-old son who has become her reason to get ahead without allowing herself to be distracted by obstacles.  She lives with her sister Rosa, who works as a private employee, in the city of Atuntaqui in the province of Imbabura in the north of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nAtuntaqui is a place with a lot of historical sites for those who visit as well as a delicious cuisine that's the favorite of many people in the country.  Another well-known activity in the canton is textiles, because industrial and artisanal clothing design has become an industry that contributes sustained growth to the city.  The garments made there are preferred nationally and internationally for their different quality and designs.  The dry and temperate climate is agreeable, which helps keep the land fertile and appropriate for growing grains and vegetables.  With all these opportunities in Atuntaqui, the city is considered an important center of production in Ecuador, something that wouldn't be possible without the strength and enterprising spirit of the residents, who also generate jobs for families in the province.\r\n\r\nLourdes started her business a year ago.  She sells \"salchipapas,\" a fast food of fried potatoes and sausages that's very popular with young people and adults.  She learned the job from some relatives and devotes six hours every day to it.  After she cleans her utensils and her small space, she begins to sell fruits and vegetables retail.\r\n\r\nLourdes hopes to expand her space someday and convert it into a restaurant for customers who enjoy her flavors.  She has requested a loan to begin to make some repairs to her locale and make it more attractive for her customers.  She'll also buy some tools and utensils to facilitate her work.  This way she'll be able to dedicate more time to her child and earn profits that will give her a better lifestyle.\r\n\r\nLourdes is grateful to those who support her cause through Kiva and have believed in entrepreneurs such as herself.  When asked why she got the loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa she said she's very satisfied with the ease, flexibility, trust, and personal counseling they gave her there.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1333707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is a problem solver. She believes that \"there is not better wisdom then the wisdom that comes at the right time\". She has had much life experience, as she is married and is raising four children. Oygul was born in a rural area with good conditions for raising livestock and growing crops. Since her childhood she helped her parents take care of cattle and is an experienced rancher. She also grows her own animal feed. Oygul invests profits from her business to improve the living conditions of her family. Last year, Oygul's husband came back from Russia to help with livestock. Now he needs to go back to Russia for work. In Tajikistan he has no regular job and the livestock business does not yield enough money to support all of them. Oygul has turned to Kiva for a loan so she can buy her husband an airplane ticket, while she stays behind and takes care of cattle. She is requesting a loan of 4000 somoni. Oygul hopes for your charity and kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1331457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy an air ticket for her husband who wants to go work in Russia ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":368.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":368.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1475,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7030.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693651}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T19:38:50Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:02:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":548686,"name":"Venus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Venus, 35, resident of Malibay, Pasay, Philippines.

generous soul. She wants to urgently start a new business. Muhbira is 47 years old, married and has three adult children. Her husband works as a driver and earns a small salary.

She wants to organize a livestock feeding business, as she has experience in this area. She plans to use the profits from the business to provide high quality nutrition for her children.

She is divorced and is raising her two sons alone. Dilorom now lives with her parents and her siblings - it's a big family of seven. She is the oldest daughter and not only graduated with distinction from high school, but also attended university. Unfortunately, she was not able to complete her degree as the family could not afford to pay tuition. Instead, since 2010 Dilorom has been managing a shop that sells household goods. Dilorom purchases her inventory in another city and has had some difficulties managing the store as she does not have much business experience. But she is determined to succeed as she knows there is no one else to rescue her except herself.\r\n\r\nCurrently Dilorom is renting a stall at the local market, but she has big plans for the future. She wants to purchase her own store, but currently lacks the savings for such a move. Her parents told Dilorom about Arvand\/Kiva and she turned to the organization for a loan. She likes the lending terms and conditions for this organization. She is planning to use this loan to expand her inventory and increase profits. Dilorom is thankful to Kiva for financially supporting people during hard time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1329603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase household goods for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T18:10:42Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T18:10:42Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilorom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":448.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":463.12},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":478.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":494.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":510.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":527.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":544.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":562.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":580.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":600.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":619.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":640.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":661.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":682.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":705.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":728.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":752.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":94.16,"local_amount":448.37,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":448.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971479},{"amount":97.25,"local_amount":463.12,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":463.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751999},{"amount":1908.59,"local_amount":9088.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":9096.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616087}],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T03:12:14Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":548699,"name":"Rosario","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosario raises pigs and is a farmer.

He is planning to start a sheep herd for future resale at the meat market, as it is a lucrative business and does not require hard work or much time. Besides, Nuriddinkhon has a good barn for keeping the sheep. He is taking out this loan to purchase a few animals and feed for them. Nuriddinkhon  will use the profits from this venture to finance his little sister's wedding

","en":"Mahbuba is a successful and conscientious woman. She is 27 years old, married and is raising 2 children. Her husband is a day worker and earns little and Mahbuba has to provide for many household expenses on her own. She works in the local hospital as a nurse and also earns a tiny salary. So Mahbuba has decided to organize her own grocery store business. Since she lives in a rural area, she expects that her business will take off as there is little competition. Her neighbors are all very happy to know she is starting a grocery store, so she expects them to be regular customers. She will be selling high quality groceries at the local market. To prepare herself Mahbuba attended a class \"Achieve Success\" organized by the Association of Businesswomen and received her certificate. She is requesting a loan of 1000 somoni to purchase the first batch of groceries for resale. Mahbuba hopes for your kindness!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1332579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

","en":"Akpar is a man with a generous soul. All his life he has been working hard and earning money to provide for his family. He got very lucky with his wife - she is a kind and hard working woman who works as a seamstress. Akpar has four adult children. His two oldest daughters are married and have children themselves. His two sons also want to get married, and asked their father to pay for the celebration, but Akpar has no savings for wedding expenses. He works as a taxi driver and has been successful in it for 31 years - he is a talkative and polite man and his clients are always pleased. But Akpar uses all the income from the taxi business to buy groceries and other household necessities for his family. Akpar is requesting a loan of 10,000 somoni from Kiva to pay for his sons' weddings. He hopes for your generosity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1332649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding

She makes her living selling sweets and candy in a stall located in the area of Chasquipampa.\r\n\r\nThis loan is her seventh with this communal bank, Rosa will use the loan to buy a shelf where she can sell her products as the cold season is approaching and this affects her sales as she sometimes doesn't go out to sell, but she will soon have a stall where she can be a little sheltered from the cold. The reason she is seeking this loan is due to a lack of working capital. \r\n\r\nRosa faces challenges in her business such as competition.

Maritza works in tailoring : she makes and repairs clothes for women, men and children. She designs her own patterns and sells them in her small shop; she occasionally also sells clothes she buys wholesale in other cities. \r\nHer customers trust her as her patience, passion for her work, and attention to detail allow her to create quality work. She has been a seamstress for about 25 years and has always worked by herself. She really enjoys her work, although she has at times felt unable to continue as she thought she could not come up with new designs; as a result, she took courses in fashion design which helped her create new clothes. With time, she was able to conquer her fears and today is an excellent seamstress. She hopes to set up a tailoring workshop and become known throughout the country.

She started by renting a small market stall in Kapan where she sold office and school supplies. After a lot of hard work Karine was able to purchase her own store in 2011. Every month Karine travels to Yerevan to purchase batches of books, office and school supplies, as well as photo frames and stuffed toys which she transports to Kapan for resale in her store. She pays particular attention to have new books by popular authors, so her store has a good reputation and many regular clients in Kapan and surrounding towns and villages of the Syunik region. Karine is 50 years old and single. She was born and lives in Kapan together with her mother and brother. Karin's mother is retired and after work Karine also takes care of her sick mother. \r\n\r\nKarine is applying for a loan of 500,000 Armenian drahm to finance a whole sale purchase of book, magazines and office supplies for her book store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1332709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

standards and he has to urgently perform repairs. He must fix all the rooms in his house as well as the exterior, as his house is large and requires a major renovation. Maksudjon is married and has four children - two are adults and the other two are still attending high school and constantly asking parents to repair the house. Unfortunately, Maksudjon's cattle business does not provide enough income to finance such a big expenditure at once.  He has been raising livestock for 15 years and his caring wife always helped him with this business. To pay for house repairs Maksudjon is requesting a loan of 3000 US dollars which he will use to purchase construction supplies such as cement, sand, lumber etc. Maksudjon and his children are really counting on your kindness and generosity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1332712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

","en":"Tolibjon is 24 years old. He was born into a working class family and grew up poor. Tolibjon always dreamed of attending the university and receive a bachelor's degree, but his family's situation prevented it. Instead, after school he started doing odd jobs and so made a modest living. After saving some money Tolibjon was able to buy a car and has been offering taxi services for about a year. He is married and has a two year old son. Tolibjon's taxi business significantly improved the living situation of his family and he wants to further expand his business. For this purpose he needs to buy a better car as his car is old and in bad condition. He is asking for a loan of 5000 somoni to purchase a new car. He is hoping for your charity as this loan will help him increase his profits and improve the life of his young

","en":"Inomjon is 25 years old. He is a good, kind, hardworking and happy young man. Inomjon is married and has a toddler. For the last two years he has been raising cattle for a living. He is good at managing the animals and is steadily learning the finer aspects of the trade.

She lives in Gurjaani District with her husband and two sons. Khatuna requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is her husband\u2019s small salary working as guide. Khatuna has hens and she sells eggs locally. It is hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKhatuna requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor.
