This business grew and helped her to sustain her father\u2019s family and supporting education for her young brothers. She later obtained a loan of 500,000 from Ugafode which has helped her to prosper, and this inspired her to mobilize women of her age to form a development group called Itara Women.

Lom Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chinlhing is married and she has six kids. She lives in a village with her husband and her kids. Her husband is a daily wage earner and he also serves as an executive member in the Village Authority Board. Chinlhing is the featured borrower of the Lendou Lom group and she is pictured with her hand raised. \n\nShe used to raised pigs and sell them when they were fully grown. She talks of her experiences and all the difficulties she faced while raising pigs. There were times when contagious diseases infected the pigs and, since she could not afford standard treatment, the animals had to be slaughtered to prevent the spread of disease. It is a big loss for people like her, because the pigs were bought with a loan which has to be repaid even if the pigs die. So she decided to quit the piggery and start a new business.\n\nShe wants to start a garment-selling business by taking out a loan. She will get used clothes from the city and sell them in the village and in the neighbouring villages.

Mayra is 43 years old. She was widowed four years ago and now is responsible for helping her two children get ahead. Currently her children are in school receiving a basic education and household expenses are increasing. At the same time, family income has fallen due to the sudden death of her husband in an accident. Mayra found it necessary to work and had the idea of opening a traditional second-hand shop in her home. She operates a small business from her car where she sells all kinds of used articles, such as toys, clothing, shoes, used chairs, and items for babies such as walkers and \u201cperiqueras,\u201d (a kind of baby chair).  In recent years, Mayra has been adding a greater variety of merchandise to her business, such as perfume, creams, dresses, cosmetics and costume jewelry, etc. Currently, thanks to her dedication and determination, Mayra has an extensive clientele and is known for her second-hand business in her area because she offers good prices and meets the needs of her neighbors. \r\n\r\nWith the idea of continuing to grow, Mayra wants to acquire a metallic structure where she can exhibit her merchandise in the markets surrounding her neighborhood. Consequently she requested support in order to acquire this structure that without a doubt will help her to set up a stall in the markets and increase her sales even more.\r\n\r\nIn the future, and if her business in the markets does well, Mayra wants to hire some assistants to help at her stall. She would like to generate a few jobs to help more families and at the same time be able to have a little more time with her children. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1334384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a metallic structure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Monterrey","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"25.666667 -100.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T23:20:04Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10898.3,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":566.95},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":613.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":663.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":718.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":777.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":841.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":910.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":985.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1248.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1351.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.82,"local_amount":566.95,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":568.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372914093},{"amount":50.67,"local_amount":613.53,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":615.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381691799},{"amount":54.83,"local_amount":663.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":666.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390794244},{"amount":59.33,"local_amount":718.5,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":720.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399803625},{"amount":64.21,"local_amount":777.54,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":779.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410079724},{"amount":69.49,"local_amount":841.42,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-13T09:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":844.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419846190},{"amount":75.19,"local_amount":910.56,"processed_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-05T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":913.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429495171},{"amount":81.38,"local_amount":985.38,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-03T09:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":988.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439719314},{"amount":398.08,"local_amount":4820.47,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T09:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4835.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449625129}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T15:30:55Z","paid_date":"2014-08-02T09:44:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":548778,"name":"Karrar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Karrar is a 27-year-old youth client from Iraq.

In the picture, she displays her previous maize yield.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

In order to build his dream house, he is requesting a loan of 6,900,000 MNT.

Using those materials, he can build his own house, which will enable the family to live in a comfortable and warm place during harsh winter times. More importantly, this dream house will contribute to the efforts against air pollution, because the family will burn less coal and emit less smoke.

person, 42 years of age. He has a positive outlook in life, treats people well and is always ready to help out those in need. He does a lot of house repairs on his own and teaches these skills to his sons and their friends. Yunus is married and has three children: two sons and a beautiful daughter. His wife is a homemaker; she takes care of the household and, along with her husband, raises their children. Yunus works as a car mechanic and he has his own repair shop in which he works. This business brings in enough income for everyday household needs, including the needs of his children. Soon his eldest son is about to get married. Such an event is a big joy for the parents, but requires a lot of work and expense. This is why Yunus needs funds in order to do  major repairs his house, where the newlyweds will live after the wedding, and also to pay for the wedding reception. Facing this challenge, Yunus turned to Arvand for a loan to realize his goals, since relying just on the income from his business, he would need a very long time to save enough funds. Yunus is hoping for a positive decision by Arvand and thanks you in advance.

Nadia requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected, because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nThe family has a car. Nadia\u2019s husband drives it as a taxi to earn a small daily income, which is the only source of income for the family.\r\nNadia requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program has provisions for business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.

Esto no representa un problema para ella, ya que lo que desea es salir adelante y cubrir las necesidades de su familia. \n\"La gente no tiene dinero porque no le gusta trabajar, si viven en su pobreza es porque no quieren esforzarse; el dinero est\u00e1 ah\u00ed afuera y al que trabaja duro no le falta nada\" son palabras que nos mencion\u00f3 la se\u00f1ora en algunas de las entrevistas con Credituyo. Adicionalmente, Cada mes Do\u00f1a Lute se traslada a una ciudad cercana a vender sus productos naturales con algunos de sus familiares y amigos de aquel lugar.\n\nElla tiene a su cargo a 2 nietos debido al fallecimiento de su hija. Con el cr\u00e9dito otorgado, la Sra. Eluteria  surtir\u00e1 mas productos naturistas, especificamente suplementos alimenticios y medicinas alternativas para enfermedades como diabetes, alta presi\u00f3n, colesterol etc.  Busca extenderse a m\u00e1s mercado ya que esta teniendo una buena demanda pero desafortunadamente no cuenta con el capital para tener un buen inventario. El sue\u00f1o de la Sra. Eluteria es llegar a tener un local grande bien establecido en el centro de la ciudad. Para poderle dar un mejor futuro a sus  nietos que no cuentan con su mam\u00e1 y desean estudiar una carrera universitaria.","en":"Eluteria lives in the colony of Cerro de la Silla (an emblematic hill in the city of Monterrey), which a residential area with difficult access and steep sloping streets.  She sells tamales. a typical food in M\u00e9xico, and also natural products.  \"Do\u00f1a Lute\", as she is known among her neighbors, is well-known for making the best tamales in the area and for being a very hard worker.  Lute prepares her tamales on the weekends and delivers them mainly on Saturday and Sunday, since sales volume is high.  Many of her tamales are sold on a \"f\u00eda\" basis (an expression meaning that she will give a couple of days credit before collecting payment).  From Monday to Thursday Lute travels throughout the streets of her community, visiting her customers to collect payment.  This is no problem for her since what she wants is to get ahead and cover her family's needs.\r\n\r\n\"People do not have money because they don't like to work.  If they live in poverty it is because they do not want to make any effort.  There is money out there to be had, and the one who works lacks nothing.\"  This is what she told us during some of the interviews with Credituyo.  Also, every month Lute travels to a nearby town to offer her natural products to relatives and friends living there.\r\n\r\nShe takes care of two grandchildren after her daughter passed away.  Eluteria plans to use the loan to buy more natural products, specifically food supplements and alternative medicines for illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.  She wants to expand her market because of the high demand, but unfortunately she does not have the capital to maintain a good inventory.  Eluteria's goal is to have a well-established store in the center of the city.  She wants to give her grandchildren a better future since they do not have their mother with them and they want to get a university degree."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1334430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy natural products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Monterrey","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"25.666667 -100.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:01Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eluteria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":14377.15,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1418.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1512.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1613.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1721.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1835.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2089.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2228.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.36,"local_amount":1418.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1437.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372914094},{"amount":126.25,"local_amount":1512.64,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1533.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381691800},{"amount":134.67,"local_amount":1613.53,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1635.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399803626},{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":686.66,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":696.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410079725},{"amount":577.42,"local_amount":6917.89,"processed_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-05T10:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":7013.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429495172},{"amount":185.99,"local_amount":2228.38,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-03T09:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2259.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439719315}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T10:22:39Z","paid_date":"2014-07-03T09:35:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":549894,"name":"Eveling Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eveling, de 30 a\u00f1os de edad soltera trabaja como ejecutiva de ventas para una empresa privada, estudia la carrera de contadur\u00eda p\u00fablica y finanzas y de su salario cubre los gastos de sus estudios, para ella su carrera es muy importante porque puede contribuir al pa\u00eds con sus conocimientos.

Es una mujer que ha luchado cada d\u00eda para salir adelante con su familia, tiene dos hijos quienes ya han tomado diferentes rumbos de vida pero se han formado con la educaci\u00f3n que Amparo no tuvo la oportunidad de conseguir. Esta mujer emprendedora vive en el centro de Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Esta parroquia tiene varias viviendas de cemento y mixtas de madera con cemento.

","en":"Amparo is 31 years old and grew up in a poor but supportive family.  Unfortunately she could not continue her education after primary school but there she learned the basics which still help her in her business today.  Amparo is a woman who fights every day to move forward in life with her family.  She has two children who have taken different paths in life but who both have the education that Amparo was never able to enjoy.  This enterprising woman lives in the centre of Santo Domingo, the capital city of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province.  This is a place with a very active business sector as it has become a land port, used for exchanging goods between the mountainous and coastal regions of Ecuador.  This parish has various houses made or cement or cement and wood.  There is a much visited river where tourists and locals participate in various sports and there is also the possibility of learning about the local \"ts\u00e1chila\" culture as visitors can listen to stories told around a campfire or on the campsite.  Santo Domingo is the third most populated city in the region and local industries include agriculture, cattle raising, fishing and manufacturing in this land port between Ecuador's coastal and mountainous regions.\r\n\r\nAmparo makes a living as a street vendor selling casual clothes.  This has been her source of income for the last few years and with it she has been able to support the family.  Amparo is applying for a loan to update her clothes ranges and increase her stock so as to increase her sales.  This will then allow her to improve her lifestyle.\r\n\r\nAmparo is the leader of the \"Pupusa\" group, which has three other entrepreneurs.  Jos\u00e9, Mar\u00eda and Sara also want to develop their careers and personal lives with this loan.  Jos\u00e9 and Mar\u00eda make a living selling fruit and vegetables and Sara sells casual and sports shoes.  Together they are looking for new opportunities but have come across obstacles such as unemployment or difficulty in financing their businesses.  Nevertheless, they all have in common that they have fought with strength and work every day to bring themselves and their families forward in life.\r\n\r\nAll of the group's members are grateful for the opportunity that \"Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa\" is providing - the process is simple for the members and they are being trusted and given advice on their businesses.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milking cow, a calf and a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested products and dairy products at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGocha requested loan from Credo to start-up family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

However, he has not had success. His loan requests were all rejected because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has an agricultural plot of land where nut trees and maize are grown. They also have milk cows, which are milked to make dairy products. By selling the harvested nuts, maize and dairy products locally at the markets, the family earns a small monthly income. However, this is rarely enough to cover their living expenses. \r\n\r\nMindia has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business loans with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received loan, Mindia plans to open a cement workshop in which he can make cement blocks.

He lives in Batumi District with his 21-year-old wife, 56-year-old mother and an infant child (1 year old). Irakli requested loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but he did not have any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is Irakli\u2019s monthly salary. He works in a sugar company as a distributor. The amount of salary is really small and it\u2019s rarely enough to feed the family. \r\n\r\nIrakli requested a loan from Credo to start up family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Irakli will purchase grocery stocks to open a grocery store. He will work in the shop himself so there won\u2019t be extra expenses to pay for an employee.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

They formed a group named Maa Chandi Self Help Group. The members of Maa Chandi Self Help Group are all women from the district of Jajpur in Odisha, India. One of them is Mrs. Sovagini, who was selected as their president. The lady in the front standing third from the right-hand side in the photo is Sovagini. \r\n\r\nSovagini is 36 years old and is living with her husband and her three children. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in the activity of cultivation for a long time. She got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighbourhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. \r\n\r\nInitially she started with growing only a few vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, and onions but later on she grew bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumbers, lady fingers and 'brinjal' (eggplant). She has very good relationship with her customers as she sells fresh vegetables to her customers. \r\n\r\nNow she has a new idea: to purchase some more land for cultivation so that she can grow more vegetables on a larger scale, for which she has requested for a loan to utilize it in purchase of land, vegetable plants, seeds and fertilizers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1332739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for purchasing land, vegetable plants, seeds and fertilizers for vegetable cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Chandikhole, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2013-04-18T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-18T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sovagini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liza Rani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaysri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandhiyarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":132000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-19T10:13:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":549086,"name":"Ivan","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u041a\u0418\u0412\u0410. \u0417\u0430 \u0441\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438, \u043e\u043d \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434, \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0432 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430 1 000 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d. \n\u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0430\u0444\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0443\u044e\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443. \u0417\u0430 \u0441\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c, \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c. \n","en":"Ivan has been using Kiva loans for several years now.

Moraima\u2019s work consists in making clothes for women, men and children.  To do so, she must have extreme patience to make the items her customers request and frequently to make items she designs herself.  She sells some of them in the small space she has set aside at home.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this work for a year and has always worked alone.  She states that she\u2019s never had a complaint from her customers because she\u2019s found the way to please them so they\u2019ll leave happy.  What she likes about her work is that she can include into her clothing designs what most inspires her and besides she feels very useful.

Both Isomidin and his wife only have high school degrees and his wife stays home and raises the grandchildren. In her free time she assists her husband in growing cotton, wheat and corn. Since a young age Isomidin has been helping his family to grow various crops. After a while he was able to rent some land of his own and has been farming there ever since. At first it was hard to make ends meet as he had no other help aside from his wife. But as the result Isomidin has a lot of experience as a farmer and now makes a good profit from his land. Isomidin is taking out this loan to prepare for planting cotton and wheat. He learned from his friends that MDO \"Arvand\" gives out loans and put in an application. He is planning to use this money to purchase seeds and fertilizer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1331481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizer for soil amendment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-18T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-18T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isomidin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1553.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1597.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1641.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1735.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1783.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":326.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":335.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":344.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":364.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":326.29,"local_amount":1553.76,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1554.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550081},{"amount":335.43,"local_amount":1597.27,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1598.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774306},{"amount":344.81,"local_amount":1641.99,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1643.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673439},{"amount":1093.47,"local_amount":5206.98,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5210.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144235}],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T15:12:15Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":549130,"name":"Delfin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Delfin raises hogs and corn crops within his local community.

He is married and has three children. He lives in a small village together with his family. Bahodur loves nature and outdoors and since childhood has spent a lot of time in the pasture, where he helped his father raise cattle. Now he has his own family and is doing everything in his power to provide for his wife and children. To have a steady income and support his families needs, Bahodur has turned to the trade he knew since he was little: he raises cattle and sells the animals once they are mature. He makes a good living with this business and is taking out this loan to purchase more animals for his herd. At the time of his first loan Bahodur only had two cows but his herd has now grown to ten animals. Aside from raising cattle, Bahodur also grows produce on a small plot of land which yields additional profits. He grows various staples crops for sale at the local market. Now Bahodur wants to expand his business and will use the next loan to purchase another cow. He is hopeful that he will be able to complete all of his business goals so that he can improve life for his family. Bahodur is grateful in advance for Arvand's support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1327909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-18T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-18T19:50:05Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahodur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":653.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":679.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":679.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":653.2,"local_amount":653.2,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":653.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144236},{"amount":666.85,"local_amount":666.85,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":666.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960067},{"amount":679.95,"local_amount":679.95,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":679.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180841}],"funded_date":"2013-05-16T05:05:48Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T13:08:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":550405,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gladys, de 50 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera y vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus cuatro hijos en su casa propia .El negocio que tiene Gladys es la venta de comidas regionales por las noches pero tambi\u00e9n prepara distintos platos de comida para venderlos en el horario de almuerzo.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every-day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Hilola is a good woman. She is 29 years old, single and lives with her parents. She has always dreamed to start her own business but in the past she had no support and no savings. As Hilola lives in rural Tajikistan she has experience raising cattle and growing crops. After she took the class \"Achieve Success\" organized by Association of Businesswomen she was able to plan her business on her own. The class provided her with all current information on budgeting and organizing a business, but now Hilola needs money to get started. Hilola plans to raise cattle for resale as her trade and she is requesting a loan of 3000 US dollars to purchase cattle. She awaits your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1333323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Madina is a hardworking woman. She is divorced and has now children. Madina is very skilled with her hands - she can sew beautiful national Tajik dresses. As she has no children and no husband, she is taking care of herself by herself. She owns two sewing machines and now wants to organize a sewing business and sell her garments at the local market. Madina received a certificate after taking the \"Achieve Success\" class organized by the Association of Businesswomen. This class has taught her much about managing and budgeting. Madina is requesting a loan of 2000 somoni to purchase fabrics for her sewing studio. She awaits your kindness. This is her first loan and she promises to repay everything on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1333336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To

","en":"Muhabbat is 42 years old. She is married and has three children. Muhabbat lives in a remote region where the main ways of life are farming and raising livestock. Muhabbat has been growing various crops, such as tomatoes, rice, wheat and other grains for more then 15 years now. Her husband does not help her as he has his own business and is busy. However, her daughter and her daughter-in-law do help take care of the crops. Muhabbat grows 0.5 hectare of wheat and 0.1 hectare of tomatoes.

Buhojal's trade is raising cattle and she took over this business from her diseased husband. Her only daughter works in the local school and they are still living together. Buhojal's daughter also supplements the family's budget. Buhojal's nephew is responsible for taking the cattle for resale at the livestock market. Every month he drives the mature animals to the market and immediately buys new calves for feeding. Buhojal's business has been yielding good profits and she is grateful to her nephew for the help. Aside from cattle, Buhojal also grows tomatoes and cucumbers for sale. Currently Buhojal wants to expand her herd and so has turned to Arvand for a loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1328997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-18T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-18T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Buhojal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":966.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":999.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1033.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":209.48,"local_amount":966.85,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":997.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900900},{"amount":216.59,"local_amount":999.63,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1031.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550082},{"amount":223.93,"local_amount":1033.52,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1066.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774307}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T22:35:00Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":549713,"name":"Adjovi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Femme d\u2019un pasteur et maman de 02 enfants \u00e2g\u00e9s de 08 et 03ans, Adjovi est couturi\u00e8re de profession.

She is a hard worker who has a lot of strength and a great desire to do well and make progress in life.  Lesvia is married and has two dependent children who are in elementary school.  The family live together under one roof.  Lesvia finished Middle School and is grateful to her parents for the enormous amount of support they gave her so that she could achieve this.\r\n\r\nLesvia and her husband have a business raising and selling pigs and a business selling tortillas. They have been running these businesses for 5 years.  Their pig business is located behind their home, in a space where they built a small pigpen.  The space has water installed for cleaning the pigs.  There is also a small wooden crate which holds the pigs' food.  Lesvia's customers are people who sell pork at different markets in the area and people who make tamales.\r\n\r\nLesvia is requesting help to buy 8 pigs.  This will allow her to increase the number of animals she has so that she can supply people during festive holidays and other times of year when her product is in demand.\r\n\r\nLesvia's dreams are to further expand her pigpen because if she had more space she would be able to keep more animals.  This would allow her to contribute more toward her household expenses and help support her children's education so that they can finish school and enjoy a better lifestyle.

He is a farmer, and for more than 25 years, he has planted beans and corn, which has given him a lot of experience with these crops. He has been able to help his family advance with the sales from his harvests. Domingo wants to increase his production and hire other people to help him with the harvests. He also has new plans for his farm, like raising chickens, as the photo shows. But he doesn't have enough capital to be able to do it. So he decided to apply for a loan that will allow him to buy corn and bean seeds, insecticide, manure, some work tools, etc. He is confident he will be able to pay back the loan and give his family what they need with no limitations.

muy joven. Est\u00e1 casada con Washington de 37 a\u00f1os con quien tiene 4 hijos a quienes esperan darle la educaci\u00f3n que ellos no tuvieron la oportunidad de terminar y por lo que se encuentran estudiando en una escuela p\u00fablica cerca de su residencia. Camila vive con su esposa e hijos  en la Parroquia Chig\u00fcilpe a 15 minutos del centro de Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Esta parroquia tiene varias viviendas de cemento y mixtas de madera con cemento. Tiene un r\u00edo que es muy visitado y en donde los turistas y habitantes practican varios deportes y adem\u00e1s tienen la oportunidad de conocer una cultura ts\u00e1chila que suele contar sus leyendas a los visitantes en medio de una fogata y camping. Santo Domingo que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nCamila vio la necesidad de aportar en su familia con los ingresos ya que el trabajo de su esposo como maestro enderezador no alcanzaba para la manutenci\u00f3n de su hogar, principalmente porque sus hijos van creciendo y necesitan cubrir gastos mayores de educaci\u00f3n, vestimenta y otros. Es por esto que Camila desde hace 5 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con la actividad de venta de cosm\u00e9ticos y joyas lo cual le da cierto porcentaje de ganancia por sus ventas y tambi\u00e9n obtiene premios que los usa en su hogar. Aprendi\u00f3 de una amiga quien la anim\u00f3 a realizar esta actividad y ahora le dedica al menos 8 horas. Esta madre esforzada ahora quiere emprender con la venta de ropa casual para lo cual requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 mercader\u00eda al por mayor en un almac\u00e9n donde ofrecen atractivos descuentos y as\u00ed ella pueda visitar a sus clientes y ofrecerles este nuevo producto para que sus utilidades mejoren y as\u00ed el estilo de vida de su hogar mejore. Camila agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por la excelencia en servicio que han tenido con ella al brindarle apoyo para conseguir sus sue\u00f1os, ella est\u00e1 muy satisfecha por la agilidad, confianza, servicios y asesor\u00eda de su ejecutivo que le han permitido tener esperanza en su futuro. Piensa que el producto Kiva es muy acertado para personas como ella que buscan oportunidad de obtener capital para lograr sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"Camila is 36 years old. She has a primary school education, and she learned to work when she was very young. She is married to Washington, age 37, and they have 4 children together, whom they hope to give the education they themselves did not have the opportunity to complete. The children are attending a public school near their home. Camila lives with her husband and children in the Chig\u00fcilpe Parish, 15 minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, capital of the Province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. This is a place with very active commerce, since it has become a terrestrial port of exchange between Ecuador's coastal and mountain regions. This parish has some homes made of cement and some made of both wood and cement. It has a river which is popular with visitors, where tourists and local inhabitants practice various sports, and they also have the opportunity to get to know the Ts\u00e1chila culture, since the people tend to tell their legends to visitors around a campfire, on camping trips. Santo Domingo, which has the third largest population in the region, also contributes with activities such as agriculture, ranching, fishing and manufacturing. \r\n\r\nCamila saw the need to provide income within her family, since her husband's work as a teaching director was not sufficient to support their household, mainly because their children are growing and they need to cover higher costs for education, clothing, etc. For this reason, five years ago Camila began selling cosmetics and jewelry, which gave her a certain percentage of profit on her sales, and she also obtained prizes which she uses in her home. She learned from a friend who encouraged her to do this work, and now she dedicates at least 8 hours to it. This hard-working mother now wants to start selling casual clothing, for which purpose she needs a loan with which she will buy merchandise on a wholesale basis in a warehouse where they offer attractive discounts. Thus she will be able to visit her customers and offer them this new product. In this way, her profits will increase and her household's standard of living will improve. Camila is grateful to the Alternativa Foundation for the excellent service they have provided to her in giving her support to achieve her dreams. She is very satisfied with the flexibility, confidence, services and advising of her executive committee, which has allowed her to have hope for her future. She believes that the Kiva product is very appropriate for people like her who are looking for the opportunity to obtain capital to achieve their dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1335192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She lives with her husband and four sons, ages 27, 24, 21 and 18 years. To increase the income of her family, in the year 2011, Taruni along with four other like-minded women from her village formed a group named <i>Thakurani<\/i> and availed a loan from Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\nTaruni is running two businesses. One is procurement of seasonal agricultural products like paddy, pulses, etc., and selling them in the market at a higher price. Another one is a milk business. The husband of Taruni goes from market to market and procures the products. Taruni helps her husband to stock the materials in their residence. She also does her milk business from her house.\r\n\r\nTaruni earns a monthly income of 6,000 Indian rupees from the present business. From this small income, she can hardly manage her family's expenses. So, she wants to increase the volume of her business to increase her income. Taruni wants to invest the entire loan amount in the procurement of agricultural products. This will help her to make some extra income in the pick period. Taruni hopes to construct a house and get marriages for her sons.\r\n\r\nThe other three active group members are Mira, Kabita and Bhumisuta, who are doing dry fish, tailoring and fancy item vending businesses respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1333216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for procurement of paddy and pulses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-19T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-19T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Taruni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhumisuta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":48000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":48000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-19T13:04:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":550220,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Mariam est n\u00e9e en  Novembre 1977 \u00e0 Kiffosso sous-pr\u00e9fecture de Yorosso (cercle de Koutiala).

Currently her farm includes 10 chickens. She cultivates corn and tomatoes and besides that, grows apricots, plums, nuts and apple trees.\r\n\r\nTogether with her family, Tamara works hard to gather a good harvest and sell the harvest in the local market. Realizing that agriculture is the only source of income for their family, Tamara would like to enlarge her business. She has requested this loan to purchase corn seeds and hire workers to start the cultivation process.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for Tamara and her husband to do the cultivation process alone. That's why the loan is very important for them. Tamara hopes that with the help of this loan she will be able to get more harvest and this will significantly increase their income, which is very important for covering the family's

Using those materials, she and her husband will repair the house. As a result, the whole family will live in a comfortable and warm place.

She is the mother of 4 children of which only one studies.  The others work and are independent.  She lives in the city of Granada and she sells new clothes. She makes clothes for infants such as sheets, shirts, pillowcases, dresses, shoes, and various other items for infant wear. She began to work in sewing when she was 15 years old.  Her mother taught this trade to her and to her sisters.  Thanks to what they learned, she has survived. In addition to selling infant wear, she also sells new clothes for men and women. She began to get income from this activity 5 years ago. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy fabric, different colored thread, bath towels, pants, blouses, underwear, etc. This loan will allow her to sell and to gain new clients.

She has made a living as a caretaker at a home for the past six years, which provides her with continuity and stability. She works Monday-Friday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., and on the weekends she travels to some of the surrounding communities to sell all kinds of clothing as well as cosmetics. She came to the offices of Kiva partner CEPRODEL requesting a loan to belong to the water and sanitation alliance. This will allow her to build a bathroom that will include a toilet, shower and sink as well as a septic tank, since the current conditions aren't very good. In this way she will have these essential services inside her home and have a more dignified place to live with improved conditions, since the latrines contaminate the environment and through this project she will be able to enjoy better health and hygiene and avoid illnesses.
