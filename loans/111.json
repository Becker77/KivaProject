It includes six members, who know each other and are neighbors: Felipa C. R. plans to use her loan to buy merchandise, including avocados, apples, peaches, guava, and loquat fruit to stock her store; Anabel Z. C. will buy chemical fertilizer for her nopal [prickly pear] to get it to grow; Alberta Arag\u00f3n Noriea will buy chemicals to fertilize her crops and increase production; Martha Graciela Mart\u00ednez M. will buy products to make her nopal grow better; Benita V. will buy boxes of avocados, and spray to increase the plants' production; and Gudelia Ch\u00e1vez G. will repair her chainsaw by changing the chain, spark plugs, oil, gas, etc. \r\n\r\nMartha Graciela Mart\u00ednez M. is a member of the group.  She is forty-years-old and completed the third year of secondary school to get her certificate.  She has seven children: Sandy Paulina, twenty-one,  is in her first semester of a degree program in physical education; Roberto, twenty, is in his fifth year of a degree program in economics; Brian, eighteen, is in his first semester of a degree program in economics; Brandon, fourteen, is in his third year of secondary school; Guadalupe, twelve, is in her third year of secondary school;  Hugo, six, is in his second year of elementary school; and Argelia, five, is in kindergarten.\r\n\r\nThe loan Martha is seeking is to buy produce, including nopal, avocados, peaches, lemons, custard apples, tomatoes, and guava.  She is very excited about this loan because it's the first one she has requested.  She's in business selling nopal, avocados, peaches, custard apples, tomatoes, and guava, and she also grows the nopal.  Martha is married; her husband works three days a week as a van driver, and the other four days growing nopal, weeding, hoeing, and spreading seeds.\r\n\r\nMartha started her business ten years ago out of necessity.  Between the kids growing and their education, there was a growing financial need.  Plus, the kids sure are good students.  Martha also grows nopal.  It's a good business, but the season is ending, and after five good months, prices are dropping.  She sells in the  Xochimilco market, traveling an hour to get there.  She stocks up on peaches and avocados at the Abastos Cuautla Central Market in T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n.  Her business is important because it's a source of income, another means of support. In addition, she knows the people who come to her house from the country to buy her fresh produce.  She gets great satisfaction with the nopal she and her children grow; they participate, too, and everyone works together Saturdays and Sundays.  Her children help her cut lemons, avocados, and guava. She feels very proud that she has been able to buy two computers: one for the little ones in grade school, and one for the high schoolers who have now gone to college.  \r\n\r\nMartha has plenty of customers; they seek her out because she's got pickled nopals that are delicious because she makes them with so much love.  She gets about sixty customers per day.  Her business is popular for the tastiness of the pickled nopal.  The challenge is that in the Xochimilco market there are other vendors selling the same products.  She spends her profits on transporting her kids to school, and for their clothing and shoes.  She would like to expand her business.  She's saving a bit of the profits to add some new products like lettuce, papalo herb, and cilantro.  Her hopes and dreams include seeing her children win out so they don't suffer and wind up in the countryside.  The goal is for them to finish their studies and find work.  This loan will  help because she bought fertilizer for her nopal seed, and bacteriacide to fight spots on the nopal.\r\n\r\nMartha likes Tlalnepantla because it's beautiful and serene, and also for its hills and history.  She says that Pancho Villa came and drank with his animals from an underground spring that runs through the hills.  Regarding Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad she says, \u201cThank them, and tomorrow introduce my children who have their degrees already, so we don't come across poorly.  Ask them to keep supporting all the people who come knocking at their door.  And I'm really asking God to keep this going, so that more people can benefit from loans because the help is really needed.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":621718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for their nopal so they can produce more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLANEPANTLA MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T01:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gudelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415409},{"amount":200,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415410},{"amount":200,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554987},{"amount":440.91,"local_amount":5511.36,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5525.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691477},{"amount":322.62,"local_amount":4032.71,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430661},{"amount":296.27,"local_amount":3703.42,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3712.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849943},{"amount":72,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":902.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292520},{"amount":268.2,"local_amount":3352.51,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3360.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160893}],"funded_date":"2010-10-26T13:30:32Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":245238,"name":"Alba Nidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alba Nidia tiene 3 hijos y trabajan de manera independiente.

in the central city market. There are few other businesses selling similar items in the market where Shahlokhon has her kiosk. Because of this, customer demand continues to grow all the time. Shahlokhon has established a reputation as an entrepreneur with integrity. \r\n\r\nShahlokhon is requesting a loan for 5000 TJS to re-stock her inventory before the fall season. Compelling prices, along with a wide range of fashion and fabric choices to suit every taste and lifestyle, will attract many new female clients to her business. An increase in sales will help her generate more profit and expand her trade even more.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is caring for his 5 beloved children.  They live together in his own home in the Kimbiri district.  Honorato fulfills the role of father and mother due to his family's circumstances.  Since he was very young, his parents instilled in him how to work on the small farm.  He is a country-person and depends on a plot of land with pineapple plantations.  Honorato has been working for 23 years on his own land.  During the harvest times he counts on the support of his children and day laborers to make progress more quickly with the extraction of the fruits.  What he likes the most about his job is harvesting the fruits from the plants, since he feels that the challenging months provide him with compensation for the quality of his fruits.  He considers that the most difficult part is transporting his products from the small farm to the city of San Franscisco, the place where they give him the best prices for his products.  He is asking for the loan to be able to buy more pineapple plant seeds and to be able to exchange them for the coffee plants, because the pineapple fruits generate a better income and in less time.  This will be his 3rd loan with MFP.  He knows that if he pays it on time, he will be able to obtain another loan with greater ease, and he will not bring complications to his communal bank.  With the 2,000 nuevos soles, he will buy more pineapple seeds in order to improve his farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":980573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

P., age 37, lives in the Gal\u00e1n neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  She is separated and has a 15 year old son.  She now lives at home with her family, where they sell lunches and cold drinks.  It is a family business.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan for 2,000,000 COP to buy drinks, refreshments, and supplies for food that she makes during special times like Carnaval.  This is when neighborhood families organize a party in the street and have fun safely.\r\n\r\nThey started the business selling bananas and vegetables in the entrance of a supermarket.  She sold the place because they started paving that affected their sales.  She then went to the market in Barranquilla where she established her business of selling economical lunches liked stuffed potatoes, rice with chicken or dried fish, rice wrapped in a leaf with meat, chicken, egg, and vegetables.  As they are now restructuring the market, she moved again in order to set up the family business in a stable place.  They sell lunches, refreshments, and everything having to do with fried food from her father\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nBesides her business of selling food, Sandra learned how to use industrial sewing machines in training given by Sena (National Service for Learning).  The Santo Domingo Foundation arranged for her to take the course, and she achieved a higher level of efficiency on the machines.  She also took a business course, and she realized that it would be very expensive to buy the industrial sewing machines and set up all of the structure to launch a business.  That is why she does not have her own seamstress shop.  She dreams of one day being able to have the money that will allow her to buy the machinery to create her own clothing business.  That is why she works hard, but also happily and dynamically.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He learned this business through family tradition, as his family has been in the same line of work ever since they lived in his hometown of Bucaramanga, a place also called \"the city of parks,\" which is located in the department of Santander del Sur.  Although he has been building up experience since he was 15 years old, he had always worked in the family business.  A year ago, he became independent so that he could generate his own income, because as he is an adult with a 1 year-old child, he had to start thinking about the development of his family with his wife.  His main challenge is that he doesn't have enough capital, and this makes him less competitive since he loses customers.  This is the reason that he is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing that he has gotten through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan, he will buy accessories for shoes and materials and supplies such as uppers, soles, insoles and buckles in large quantities so that he can get a bulk discount.  But above all, he will be able to have a greater assortment of items that will allow his new customers to have a better view of his business.

They are married and have children. They have different businesses such as selling cereals (corn, beans), mats and soaps. Since their main business is related to cereals, they have a common shop where they stock their goods. They are very energetic and help their husbands with the family expenses.

Aziadekor is married and has six kids in his care, some of whom are in school.  Of the six children, five are biologically his.  He alone takes care of the children's different expenses.  Aziadekor has never been to school.  He has fished for 35 years, to provide for his needs and for those of his children.  He buys fish nets and wood (acadja) at the Dantokpa market in Cotounou, and does his work in a Cotonou lake.

Her hard work is to generate good income to strengthen her home's wellbeing. In addition to making fried foods and selling beer, as already mentioned, she also makes clothing in all types of fabric and styles as well as curtains. She does clothing repair as well. GRadually, her food business has grown and she needs to buy a fryer to make the preparation of her fried food easier. She also needs to buy ingredients such as oil and beer in bigger quantities to get discounts and pass on the savings in her products. This is the reason that she has taken out a Kiva loan. Her working capital isn't enough to do it with. Her financial indicators show that her business is stable and conditions are favorable for investment. Her goal and big challenge is to increase her sales in order to have more family income and continue to support her children achieve their goals.

His business is agriculture and livestock farming, and he is married and the father of four children.  His two older children work in the fields and the other two are in school.  His beginnings were difficult because he had no tools or machinery to work with so he had to rent oxen to plough the land.  For entire days on end he would stand guard to prevent thieves or animals from damaging the crops.  Little by little he became a crop farmer on his own and was able to save enough to buy his own land.  He also bought a cow to start raising livestock.  Now his family helps with the field work but his house is in disrepair because of the heavy rainfall in his country.  This is why he is requesting a loan to buy construction materials so he can repair the house little by little.

After leaving the military, this veteran waited for the right opportunity to launch out and start his own business. When the housing market crashed in 2007, the number of bank-owned properties sky-rocketed, creating a large need for property preservation and maintenance. Seeing the opportunity in the market, Russell started R\/M Asset Maintenance, a company which conducts foreclosure property maintenance, lawn care, clean-up and removal, as well as assisting with evictions and lock changes.  \r\n\r\nWith over a decade of experience in the construction, maintenance and janitorial industries, Russell already has the skills necessary to offer high quality, efficient service to his clients. Furthermore, his military training has instilled in him the discipline and work ethic to do whatever it takes to turn his business into a successful venture. \r\n\r\nRussell will use his $4,000 Kiva loan to purchase a truck, power generator and several power tools. This will provide him with the basic equipment necessary to get his business off the ground.\r\n\r\nRussell's dreams of self-employment is slowly becoming a reality.  Currently, Russell is working full-time for a temp agency, but hopes to grow his company to the point where he can commit to it full time.

Her family borrowed money to do business in butchering chicken.  On average, each day they sell 30kg of chicken.  Because of the success of the business, they had to hire one worker to work for the family fulltime; each month they pay him a salary of 1,500,000 VND.  Her husband is a retired veteran, with a stable monthly pension of 2,500,000 VND.  Even though he has the pension, her husband is still very hardworking and helps the family by raising fish.  The annual income from the fish business is 10,000,000 VND.  With the various sources of income, her family\u2019s finances are relatively good compared to people in the region.  She has 3 children, 2 who are grown and live on their own, and 1 who is still young and goes to school.  In this round of funding the family is requesting 15,000,000 VND to invest in the butcher shop.  Their average income is 6,000,000 VND per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb B\u00f9i Th\u1ecb V. 59 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb vay v\u1ed1n bu\u00f4n b\u00e1n gi\u1ebft m\u1ed5 gia c\u1ea7m, b\u00ecnh qu\u00e2n m\u1ed7i ng\u00e0y gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb b\u00e1n 30kg g\u00e0 th\u1ecbt, do vi\u1ec7c kinh doanh thu\u1eadn l\u1ee3i n\u00ean gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb ph\u1ea3i thu\u00ea 1 c\u00f4ng nh\u00e2n chuy\u00ean l\u00e0m cho gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb h\u00e0ng th\u00e1ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb tr\u1ea3 l\u01b0\u01a1ng 1.500.000\u0111, ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 c\u00e1n b\u1ed9 qu\u00e2n \u0111\u1ed9i v\u1ec1 h\u01b0u l\u01b0\u01a1ng th\u00e1ng \u1ed5n \u0111\u1ecbnh 2.500.000\u0111, m\u1eb7c d\u00f9 c\u00f3 l\u01b0\u01a1ng h\u01b0u nh\u01b0ng ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb r\u1ea5t ch\u1ecbu kh\u00f3 v\u1eabn lu\u00f4n ph\u1ee5 gi\u00fap c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i c\u00e1, h\u00e0ng n\u0103m thu hoach t\u1eeb th\u1ea3 c\u00e1 l\u00e0 10.000.000\u0111.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She teaches in the mornings at the official school for the town of Totonicap\u00e1n, and in the afternoon she manages a community home in the same area.  On the weekends, she is studying for a presentation at a conference on western education.    She needs a loan to pay for her conference expenses because she does not have the funds at the moment.  Therefore, she needs the support of Asociaci\u00f3n ASDIR so that she will be able to attend.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Zenobia sells salchipapas (combination of sausage and French fries) at night, since she takes care of her children during the day.  This allows her to contribute to feeding her family.  She will invest the loan in commodities needed to serve her loyal customers.\r\nDavid is the group\u2019s secretary.  Seeing his family\u2019s need, he decided to set up a business that allows him to keep expenses at home.  He sews jeans, and 2 people help him.  As is true with any business, the startup was difficult, but with a lot of hard work, his business stabilized, and he now concerns himself with raising and feeding his 3 minor children.\r\nSeveral years ago, Sonia was able to buy a car along with her partner, to work in public transportation.  Although business is down at times, she forges ahead, in order to support her 3 children.\r\nThe members are grateful for support offered by Edaprospo, and those who participate in the financing, such as kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":486584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-02-18T15:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenobia Tarcila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flavia Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apolinario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obdulia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yelitza Glynis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1262.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":443.93,"local_amount":1263,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1269.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933810},{"amount":443.57,"local_amount":1262,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1268.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661403},{"amount":443.93,"local_amount":1263,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1269.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694063},{"amount":443.57,"local_amount":1262,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1268.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877027}],"funded_date":"2010-02-19T18:18:02Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":179502,"name":"Daniel Bolivar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Daniel Bolivar is 58 and married.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Serzhik is married and has two daughters - three and two years old.\r\n\r\nHe has been engaged in agricultural business for almost seven years and owns the land where they grow vegetables. In addition, he has cattle, pigs, and 14 bee hives. Together with his wife, they sell vegetables from the garden in the markets of Syunik as well as meat, milk and honey that wholesalers purchase from his home.\r\n\r\nSerzhik received a loan from Kiva and it paid off ahead of schedule. Thanks to the loan, he added the number of bee hives and got a big profit from the sale of honey. He is asking for a loan for 700,000 drams for the purchase of feed for pigs in the winter and to buy new hives.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":905287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is a single mother of two children: 7 year old Mar\u00eda and 4 year old Robi\u00f1o. She focuses herself on the business of selling popcorn (Palomitas de Ma\u00edz) on foot through the streets of the city of Juliaca. The business is the principle source of income for her family, since she only has to look after her two sons. She has always been a happy and  persevering woman. Despite the small troubles she is faced with, she has managed to overcome so that her work should be easier to do. Norma's typical day starts at noon and ends at eight in the evening, which is when there are greater sales because of the cold in Juliaca. This single mother wants to move her children forward and demonstrate to them that they can have a good future despite the kind of economic hardships she has lived through. With this loan Norma wants to purchase several accessories she is missing for her tricycle so she can improve her production of popcorn so that it will be in greater demand.

The tamale consists of a ground cornmeal dough filled with olives and chicken with a delicious sauce.  The precise amount of seasoning that he puts in each tamale is the best guarantee Saul has to increase the demand for his product.

His desire to get ahead drove him to set up a small shop where he makes guitars. Once he finishes them, he turns them over to his cousins and brother-in-law so that they can paint and decorate them. Nicolas is very satisfied with his business, which grows more and more lucrative because he has received many orders. For this reason, he needs to expand his business and obtain the tools and materials necessary to improve the quality of his guitars even more. This is his second loan with MFP, and he has demonstrated punctuality in making his previous loan repayments.

Her father helps her with the business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, she has been selling food outside of her house in the evenings for 3 years.  This business has also done very well.  What she likes most about her jobs is that they keep her busy.  Since she considers herself to be very proactive, Janet says she is willing to work in any field.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  What she enjoys most about her Communal Bank group is that the members are responsible, although she finds their meetings to be very entertaining.  Janet will use the money to purchase more hardware products so that she can continue growing her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":429972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-20T02:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":149.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":159.31},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":161.51},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":169.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":177.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.53},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.38,"local_amount":149.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":150.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843216},{"amount":108.14,"local_amount":308.98,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":310.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734807},{"amount":4.15,"local_amount":11.84,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":11.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124142},{"amount":59.19,"local_amount":169.12,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":169.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959871},{"amount":62.16,"local_amount":177.58,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":178.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992716},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":182.81,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":183.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717500}],"funded_date":"2009-11-20T03:32:50Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":158609,"name":"Musibau","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Musibau is 25 years old, married, and has a child.

Emalin has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately $215 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Emalin joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emalin has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Emalin is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be her 5th loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Being out in the open, the cows are vulnerable to harsh weather conditions that eventually deteriorates their health and productivity.

In 2006, her father-in-law asked his son Paulo to take care of his driving school in Namaacha, a village bordering Swaziland, so they moved there.

She is the mother of 3 children aged between 11 and 6 and they all go to school.<p>\r\n\r\nAna began her studies quite late in life and when she was in the 6th grade, she fell pregnant and her boyfriend abandoned her claiming that the child she was expecting wasn't his, so she had to interrupt her studies. Her grandmother then gave her some money to start a business and she secretly sold biscuits and pastries at her local market. 2 years later she gets together with her husband who helps her take care of her business. The business began to grow and she slowly built a stall at her home. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007 she managed to complete the construction of the stall but had no capital left to buy merchandise. Through a conversation with her friends she learnt of Hluvuku's services and solicited a loan to buy merchandise. Her best products are sugar, rice, soap and salt which she buys by the kilo for 20 MZN and resells at 25 MZN, by the bag for 500 MZN and resells at 600 MZN and by the box for 200 MZN and resells at 275 MZN, as in the region where she resides they live off more agricultural products.\r\nShe works from 7am to 6pm and has a monthly income of 4,000.00 MZN, of which she manages to save 1,000.00 MZN, as apart from her children, she is also responsible for her grandmother to whom she sends 500 MZN a month.<p>\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.

There are no stores in the neighborhood where he lives so his store has gained popularity and regular customers.  Axadbek is married and has a small child.

She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who also works with the institution. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 15,000 Meticais. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, bars, blocks, iron and other items) in order to continue working on the construction of her home. Her earlier loan was for 5000 Meticais and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later.

She buys and sells shoes door to door in her community.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us that her business has gone quite well, but she needs to invest more in order for her business to grow and for her to realize her dream of having her own shoe store.  For this reason she is requesting a loan of 500,000 (five hundred thousand Colones) to purchase more shoes so she can increase her sales and offer better variety to her customers. \r\n\r\nMercedes is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Cartagena, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan.  She is very happy that she has a new opportunity to achieve her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva
