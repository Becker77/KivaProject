Esta ciudad pertenece a la Sierra ecuatoriana y est\u00e1 ubicada en el norte del Ecuador. Su clima veraniego, sus fiestas y la amabilidad de sus habitantes, son el atractivo principal de turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Predomina el arte y la cultura, pero tambi\u00e9n muchas personas han emprendido con proyectos tur\u00edsticos que ofrecen la visita a cascadas, r\u00edos, lagunas y caminatas por lugares que muestran la cultura de esta tierra.\nJaqueline desde hace 8 a\u00f1os se dedica a comercializar golosinas, frutas y verduras para poder llevar el sustento a su hogar, es una mujer a quien ning\u00fan obst\u00e1culo la ha detenido para seguir luchando por el bienestar de sus hijos, pues adem\u00e1s de tener un espacio en el mercado para hacer sus ventas, tambi\u00e9n sale a los lugares p\u00fablicos cuando hay eventos que convocan a multitudes. Gracias al esp\u00edritu emprendedor que hered\u00f3 de toda su familia, ella ha crecido con su negocio y le dedica 7 u 8 horas cada d\u00eda y en los eventos un poco m\u00e1s de tiempo pues se queda hasta altas horas de la noche, pero la dificultad de obtener cr\u00e9ditos en algunas instituciones le ha dificultado mucho su crecimiento, sin embargo, gracias a varias recomendaciones de amigos y familiares, ha acudido a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para conseguir un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de productos adicionales para cumplir la demanda de sus clientes y as\u00ed poder obtener mayor utilidad con sus ventas con lo cual poco a poco podr\u00e1 lograr cumplir su sue\u00f1o de reubicar su negocio en un lugar m\u00e1s grande, amplio y c\u00f3modo tanto para ella como para sus clientes y a un plazo un poco m\u00e1s largo poder comprar su propia casa.

","en":"Jaqueline is a 37-year-old single woman who completed primary school. She has three children, who are 13, 8, and 6 years of age. Currently Mary is the head of her family, in which she has the great responsibility of educating and providing for her children, with whom she lives in her rented home in the city of Ibarra, the capital of the province of Imbabura. This city belongs to La Sierra and is located in the northern part of Ecuador. Its summery weather, its festivals, and its friendly inhabitants are the main attractions for national and international tourists. Art and culture predominate, but many people have also launched tourist projects which offer visits to waterfalls, rivers, and lagoons, as well as walks to places which show the culture of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nFor eight years Jaqueline has sold candy, fruit, and vegetables in order to support her home. No obstacle has stopped her from continuing to fight for the wellbeing of her children. Besides having a space in the market to make her sales, she also goes out to public places when there are events on which attract multitudes of people. Thanks to the enterprising spirit which she inherited from her whole family, she has made the business grow and she spends 7 or 8 hours each day working, and a little longer when events are on as she stays late into the night, but the difficulty of obtaining loans with some institutions has made growth very difficult; however, thanks to various recommendations by friends and family, she has applied to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a loan which she will invest in purchasing additional products to meet customers\u2019 demands and obtain greater profits on her sales. With these profits she will be able to fulfill her dream of relocating her business to a bigger, wider, and more comfortable place for her and her customers, and further down the track she will be able to buy her own house. Jaqueline hopes that people from all over the world will hear her story through Kiva and that they will be able to help her and all of those who fight for their dreams through microenterprise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1335289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

38-year-old woman. She is married and has three children in her care. She is a very kind mother and a hard-working person. Mohbika works at one of her village's diners, where she cleans, washes dishes and serves customers. Her work is very hard and tiring, but Mohbika has no choice but to keep doing it as she needs to feed her family and raise her children.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Mohbika has been hoping to carry out repairs in her home, which is in need of renovation. She has some savings, but not enough to purchase the necessary construction materials. After learning about loans from MDO Arvand, LLC from her acquaintances, Mohbika decided to apply for one. She will use this loan to buy building materials and repair her home. Mohbika hopes that Arvand will help her and support her in realizing her

She prepares and sells breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals.  She offers this service at her business premises located next to her home.  Her customers are mainly truck drivers that come to the city on a trip, and pedestrians that habitually pass by her stall and who are workers in the area.  \r\n\r\nHer sales are done in cash, and her daily schedule begins at 6 a.m. and ends at 10 p.m.  With financing, her business has improved.  She has had six loans and they have strengthened her working capital, her sales, and her utilities.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is to pay attention to her growing clientele, because as her customer base grows, her capital is insufficient to respond to the demand.  This is the reason that she requests a loan through Kiva.\r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy those materials and ingredients, wholesale and with cash, that she needs to prepare her foods (rice, meats, vegetables, canned items, sugar, salt), adding new menu items to her daily service.  With this investment, she expects to be successful because she is very focused on the demand in her market, and she serves this market with a lot of care.

Elza\u2019s only source of income is her small monthly salary, 250 Laris\/month, as a waitress at a local cafe.  This is hardly enough to buy food for the family.  According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nElza requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business.  Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor who do not have access to credit products.  This group is regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.  With the received credit, Elza will begin selling clothing and household goods.  She plans to go to Turkey to purchase the clothing and household goods at wholesale prices and then resell them among her villagers.  Elza will do her best to increase the family income and improve the living conditions for her son.  This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the life of the family.

They have a daughter who is 11 years old and studies in primary school.\r\n\r\nThey are asking for a loan from Kiva in order to make improvements to their house, since there are not yet any stairs which would connect the upper level of his house, where Juan has built a room for his daughter.  He also wants to do some finish work on the outside of his home, which he has started, but still needs to finish painting.\r\n\r\nWith the money he receives from his job, he can repay the loan, and his wife's income from her jobs will serve to cover the family's daily living expenses and schooling fees.  He wants a better place for his family and now that his daughter is growing up, she needs her own space in the house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1335479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to

positive 36 year old woman. She is married and has four children. Muhayo loves her children and wants to make sure they lack in nothing. Together with her husband she earns money to feed her family and provide a good eduction for her children. She wants her children to have a promising future. Muhayo's husband is a migrant worker in Russia. Every month he sends money to his family. But Muhayo herself doesn't like to be idle, she is always in motion and is a very hard working woman.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband provide for the family Muhayo has started her own business. She sells Tajik national women's dresses and has had her business for 11 years. She purchases clothes in the city at a central market then sells them in her own village to the local women. It's very convenient for her clients, as many of them rarely visit the city and are happy to be able to buy clothes in their own village. Every time she comes back from the city the demand for her dresses grows and she needs to be able to purchase more inventory on her next trip. For this reason Muhayo has turned to Arvand for a loan which she will use to purchase a batch of traditional Tajik dresses. Muhayo is grateful for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1326499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

With the received credit Aslan will purchase two cars to start a food business. After purchasing cars he will buy food products at the wholesale price from the big market in Kutaisi district. All the products will be transported by cars in nearby regions to sell with the price markup among the villagers and at the local markets.

These ladies primarily work in the production and sale of textiles and fabrics.\r\n\r\nCrisanta is a 55-year-old mother of four boys. She is preliterate because when she was young, her parents were unable to provide her with the opportunity to attend school. Her husband works in the masonry business. Crisanta works in fabric and textile production, which has been her business for quite some time. In addition, she purchases and sells textiles. Crisanta travels by bus to a market three hours from her home to sell not only her own products but those of her ten providers as well.\r\n\r\nCrisanta is excited about the loan she is about to receive from Friendship Bridge. It will allow her to buy yarn and fabric to make more products. She is happy because two of her boys are enrolled in school this year, and one of them is about to start high school. Crisanta hopes to continue to support him so that he can graduate in two years.\r\n\r\nBoth Crisanta and the other ladies of the Trust Bank, Los Girasoles Xenacoj, enjoy the training that they receive during the monthly meeting with Friendship Bridge. They especially like the icebreaker, which they find is a real stress reliever. They find the educational topics beneficial as well, especially the one about children\u2019s rights, which was the topic of last year\u2019s November meeting. The women want to express their deep appreciation to Kiva investors. With these loans, they have a huge opportunity to realize significant changes in their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1333681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy yarn and fabric to make more shirts and t-shirts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santo Domingo Xenacoj, Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-04-19T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-19T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doria Elsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Buenaventura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Piedad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Crisanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2147},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2147},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2147},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2147},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2147},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2147},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2118}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275.53,"local_amount":2147,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2147.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924585},{"amount":275.53,"local_amount":2147,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2147.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701760},{"amount":275.54,"local_amount":2147,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2147.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564165},{"amount":275.53,"local_amount":2147,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2147.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813222},{"amount":275.53,"local_amount":2147,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2147.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089092},{"amount":275.53,"local_amount":2147,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2147.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855061},{"amount":271.81,"local_amount":2118,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2118.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503397}],"funded_date":"2013-04-20T05:35:56Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T15:32:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":548436,"name":"Wagninan Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe WAGNINAN est form\u00e9 de deux personnes qui sont des amies.

The Trust Bank was established last year and consists of seven members whose average age is 44 years. Their families consist of an average of four children, and their average education lasted 2.7 years. Most of the ladies work on backstrap looms creating beautiful textiles, while a few are the owners of small storefronts. Their businesses really make a positive impact on the economies of their families.\r\n\r\nDominga is a 40-year-old member of the Trust Bank. She is married and has four children (three girls and one boy). Dominga owns a storefront, which she has had for few years. She was pleased to invest her first loan from Friendship Bridge in her business. She mentioned that before making a final choice about her current business, she explored other options. However, she decided that having a storefront business was a good fit for her and her family. It is located in a small room of her house, so she can attend to it from home. This business has helped Dominga to support her children, and they help her with small jobs or assisting her in the business.\r\n\r\nThis is Dominga's second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge, and her first with Kiva. She feels very grateful to have this monetary support that allows her to grow financially. She plans to buy more inventory for her business and will purchase useful items like rice, sugar, vegetables, canned goods and other products that are in great demand. In this way, she can continue serving her current clients and attract new ones.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank, San Miguel Xenacoj, would like to thank Kiva investors for this valuable opportunity to secure a loan. In this way, they feel that they are on a progressive path that will lead to a better future for themselves, their families and their communities\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1333684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy inventory for her storefront grocery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santo Domingo Xenacoj, Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-04-19T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-19T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":13500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1689},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1689},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1689},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1689},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1689},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1689},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1689},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1677}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":218.94,"local_amount":1689,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924586},{"amount":218.95,"local_amount":1689,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701761},{"amount":218.94,"local_amount":1689,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564166},{"amount":218.95,"local_amount":1689,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813223},{"amount":218.94,"local_amount":1689,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089093},{"amount":218.95,"local_amount":1689,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855062},{"amount":218.94,"local_amount":1689,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503398},{"amount":217.39,"local_amount":1677,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1694.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728382}],"funded_date":"2013-04-20T12:54:08Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:03:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":551045,"name":"Rosa Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa,  se dedica a la venta de productos de belleza, posee tres a\u00f1os de realizar esta actividad y lo hace todos los d\u00edas.

He lives in the city of Cartagena with his spouse and 3 children, aged 18 to 22. He has a chicha factory. He started when his wife would make rice chica with the neighbors on their block. When Ismael left is job as an inter-city bus driver, he observed in that activity a potential for growth and sustainability in his income to benefit his home. that was how they started to make chicha in greater quantities as well as to seek markets to sell it in. His first customers were the stores in the nearby neighborhoods. Little by little they gained ground, selling the product by the case, as they do now. His sister who lives in another city also has a business selling dairy products. She proposed that he sell cheese, whey and meat. With her support, because she made him a loan, and Ismael bought his first products from her and started selling those things as well in the city of Cartagena. It has gone well for him with these, because he makes weekly orders and sells new products that supplement the family income.

She lives in her own home alongside her family, which consists of her brothers, her parents, her husband and their son. Angela makes a living selling distinct styles, colors and sizes of clothing, primarily for children. She periodically buys her merchandise herself and sells it to friends, neighbors, relatives and other acquaintances through her system of credit. She has been in this trade for eight years and generally works in the afternoon. She really enjoys selling clothes because it allows her to meet new customers and generate her own income in her free time. She has seen good profits and it's for this reason she wants to consolidate the business into a small clothing store at some site or out of her home since better infrastructure will help her better display what she has to offer. Angela is requesting the loan and is very grateful for the opportunity to have the financial support she needs to make headway. She plans to purchase a batch of clothes consisting of polos, jeans, pants, blouses, shirts and shorts to sell to her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1336297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase polos, jeans, pants, blouses and other clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-20T04:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-20T04:10:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":119.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":127.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":132.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":132.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":141.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":146.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.58,"local_amount":119.59,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578173},{"amount":51.72,"local_amount":127.31,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-22T08:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":134.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530427},{"amount":53.65,"local_amount":132.05,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":139.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975453},{"amount":54.02,"local_amount":132.97,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":140.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996722},{"amount":57.66,"local_amount":141.94,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:25:39Z","rounded_local_amount":149.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864197},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":146.14,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352569}],"funded_date":"2013-04-20T05:29:59Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":551056,"name":"Arquimides David","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"ARQUIMIDES TIENE 25 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD ES SOLTERO NO TIENE HIJOS, VIVE CON PADRES EN CHILLANES PROVINCIA DE BOL\u00cdVAR.\n\nLa VRC VIRGEN DE BA\u00d1OS est\u00e1 formada por en la comunidad mama Sara de Cerritos, a una distancia de 30 minutos de la oficina de la Cooperativa.\n\nARQUIMIDES SE DEDICA A LA AGRICULTURA A LA SIEMBRA DE FR\u00c9JOL, MORA, ADEM\u00c1S SE DEDICA A LA CRIANZA  DE GANADO.\n\nSOLICITA EL CR\u00c9DITO PARA COMPRAR SEMILLAS, UREA, HERBICIDAS, FERTILIZANTES.

He lives in the small village of Tetritskaro District with his wife and two children. Grigol requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for Grigol's family is the monthly salary of Grigol\u2019s wife, who works as a teacher at a local school.  She earns a total of 170 Laris (GEL) per month. It is hardly enough to pay for food for the family.  According to Credo estimates the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nGrigol requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan programme envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions for the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Grigol will start a grocery store.  He will purchase a stock of groceries to open the grocery store. He already has a space, where the grocery store will be situated. This will increase the income of the family.

He is a truck driver, but has also developed interactive educational software in Spanish, which provides theoretical, mechanical, and practical education, allowing users to pass the test for class A and B commercial driver\u2019s licenses (CDL). This license allows the bearer to operate heavy trucks, passenger buses, school buses, and tractor trailers. \r\n\r\nIn addition to his regular job as a truck driver, Armando has been teaching, preparing and helping students to get this license. Armando\u2019s product will make it easier to obtain a license and a job for Hispanics who do not have the financial resources needed to invest in a conventional class. After obtaining his own license, facing the high cost of tuition and language barriers, Armando decided to develop an alternative, inexpensive method of preparation for the CDL exam. The Kiva loan will be used to help Armando to finish, produce, and sell the product. \r\n\r\nArmando is married with grown children, and his wife is helping him in this new

She herself has been working as a nurse at a privately owned hospital for six consecutive years. Since the day she purchased her house, the house has never received any repair and update. So she is requesting a loan of 6,900,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, planks, fiber glass and cements. Using those materials, she can repair her house thus enabling her family to live in a more comfortable and warm place. More importantly, the renovated house will preserve heat efficiently, needing less coal for fuel, and as a result emit less smoke and that will contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

She used these materials to make footwear which she later sold.  Her Kiva loan allowed her to increase her working capital, increase her sales and make more profit from her business.  Motivated by this experience, she is now applying for a new loan through Kiva.  She will use the new loan to buy larger quantities of rubber, fique fiber, insoles and packaging materials which she will use to make more footwear to sell for Mothers Day.

Marine requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success.

In particular, they have a milk cow and a plot of land. On the land different kinds of vegetables are grown. They milk the cow to make cheese and sell it with the harvested products locally at the markets. Marine\u2019s husband works at the railway station and her aunt is trading with fruits and vegetables. They both get small monthly salaries, which is not enough to feed a five-member family. \r\n\r\nMarine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Marine will start trading with clothes. She will go to Turkey, purchase clothes at the wholesale price and bring them to her district. She will be selling clothes among her villagers with a price markup to earn a good profit. She will reinvest part of the profit in their field and bring home more clothes in order to develop the business.

They have turned to a Credituyo loan in order to finance this project. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Lazara plans to get materials such as cement, sand, and cinder blocks to remodel the bathroom that currently has many cracks and leaks water each time it rains. The rainy season is approaching so Lazara needs to do these repairs now. She is not worried about the cost of labor, since her husband will work with the help of her children to do the repairs themselves.

Revaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nRevaz has his own car washing service. He is working there and washes cars to earn a small income for the family which is not enough to cover their monthly expenses.\r\n\r\nRevaz requested a loan from Credo to restart a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Revaz will start trading clothes and household goods. He will purchase the products from the big market at the wholesale price and resell them among the villagers with a price markup. Revaz used to have this business before, and he is very experienced in this field. This will help him to restart up his business and make it successful. He will earn good profit which will be used for reinvesting and developing the business. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1333995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start trading clothes and household goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Akhaltsikhe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-20T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-20T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Revaz ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.65,"local_amount":43.65,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":43.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969177},{"amount":44.28,"local_amount":44.28,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":44.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749597},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":45.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":45.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613503},{"amount":46.6,"local_amount":46.6,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":46.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857220},{"amount":47.81,"local_amount":47.81,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":47.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133873},{"amount":371.81,"local_amount":371.81,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":371.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107460}],"funded_date":"2013-04-22T23:18:31Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":549699,"name":"Rani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rani is a 40-year-old, hardworking and diligent woman.

Her husband is a migrant worker in Russia, so Hanifamo handles the household by herself.  She has more than 2 years experience selling industrial goods at a local market.  She has regular customers and each year she expands her business.  Hanifamo wants to increase her working capital and, in turn, increase her income since she is in need of money.  She's asking for a loan of $1050 to buy more goods like thread, needles, mirrors, etc., to achieve these goals.
