She lives together with her husband in their own home. She has a loyal clientele because she does  good work and tailors clothing to the requested measurements. With the tailoring she has done she has been able to cover some household expenses, but she needs to complete some improvements to the home. The photo shows part of the house where she would like to build. As what she earns is not enough to pay for construction outright, she is requesting this loan in order to complete the improvements. This way she and her husband will be able to live more securely and have the home they have always wanted but have not had the financial stability to

He lives in Akhmeta Kutaisi district, West Georgia, with his wife and parents. Gaga requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.  Gaga works at a local wood workshop as an artisan. His mother works at the local grocery shop as a seller. They both get small monthly salaries which are barely enough to cover family monthly expenses. \r\nGaga requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Gaga will start trading with wood materials himself. As he is already experienced in this field, Gaga will purchase wood materials at the wholesale price from Turkey at a low cost and sell them with a price markup to the resellers among his district.  He will use part of the profit for reinvesting in the same field and purchase more materials in order to develop the business.

Est\u00e1 casado con Bella quien tiene 59 a\u00f1os y se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo, juntos han compartido la dicha de ver crecer a su hijo que ahora ya es un adulto independiente que form\u00f3 su familia. Ram\u00f3n vive con su esposa en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde en Santo Domingo, una ciudad del Ecuador que se ha convertido en uno de los puertos terrestres m\u00e1s importantes a nivel comercial, pues es en donde se unen las Regiones Costa y Sierra del pa\u00eds y por lo tanto en donde se intercambian productos de distinta \u00edndole y variedad; desde frutas tropicales hasta mariscos frescos tra\u00eddos del mar. Por esta oportunidad que tiene la ciudad, muchas familias han salido y producido su sustento a trav\u00e9s de la microempresa en diferentes industrias como la pesquera, bananera, manufactura, agricultura y ganader\u00eda. Adem\u00e1s el paso de turistas nacionales internacionales es aprovechado para explotar la actividad tur\u00edstica con deportes extremos y caminatas a paisajes que tienen una belleza natural incomparable. \nRam\u00f3n forma parte de estas familias emprendedoras, pues hered\u00f3 el esp\u00edritu trabajador de su familia y adem\u00e1s un amigo le ense\u00f1\u00f3 la actividad de comercializar pescado en la cual ya lleva 24 a\u00f1os, pues desde ni\u00f1o tuvo que trabajar para apoyar en el gasto de su hogar. Este hombre con alma a\u00fan joven, invierte 8 horas en su diario vivir para sacar a la venta su producto, el madruga a los puertos a retirar el pescado fresco para enseguida y con los debidos cuidados higi\u00e9nicos, llevarlo a vender a un puesto que est\u00e1 ubicado en su residencia. Como es de suponerse el pescado es vendido en su totalidad cada d\u00eda, de lo contrario tiene que ser congelado en temperatura baj\u00edsima para que no se eche a perder. Ahora Ram\u00f3n requiere un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayudar\u00e1 a adquirir herramientas de trabajo y equipo para mantener en buen estado los activos que posee. As\u00ed podr\u00e1 abastecerse de mayor producto y comprar variedad con mayor descuento para ofrecer a sus clientes un precio m\u00e1s competitivo que le generar\u00e1 mayor utilidad para poder disponer de un ahorro que responda a sus necesidades de salud y sustento en los a\u00f1os de su vejez con su esposa. Ram\u00f3n agradece por cada granito de arena que se ponga desde cualquier parte del mundo a trav\u00e9s de Kiva para que \u00e9l crezca en su negocio ya que a pesar de su edad, nada lo ha detenido para seguir luchando cada d\u00eda por su trabajo. Tambi\u00e9n agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa de quienes ha recibido el apoyo, la confianza y agilidad que en varias instituciones financieras le hizo falta para incrementar su capital de trabajo. ","en":"Ram\u00f3n is a man of advanced age; he is 63 years old and nostalgically remembers his childhood with his family, when he was able to complete primary school. He is married to Bella, who is 59 years old and works selling cosmetics from catalogs. Together, they have shared the joy of watching their son\u2014now an independent adult with his own family\u2014grow up. Ram\u00f3n lives with his wife in the R\u00edo Verde parish of Santo Domingo, a city in Ecuador that has become one of the most important inland commercial hubs, as it is where the coastal and mountain regions of the country meet. As such, it is where a wide variety of different kinds of products are exchanged, from tropical fruits to fresh seafood brought from the ocean. Because of this opportunity that the city has, many families have gone out and earned a living  through small businesses within different industries such as fishing, banana farming, manufacturing, agriculture, and livestock production. In addition, they take advantage of the flow of national and international tourists to develop the tourism industry with extreme sports and treks to landscapes of incomparable natural beauty.\r\n\r\nRam\u00f3n is is part of this group of enterprising families, as he inherited his family's hardworking spirit. In addition, a friend taught him the business of selling fish, which he has done for 24 years; he had to work starting from childhood to contribute to household expenses. This young-at-heart man invests eight hours of his daily life to selling his product. At dawn he goes to the ports to get the fresh fish to take it immediately and with the necessary hygienic measures to his sales stall, located in his house. As one might expect, he sells all the fish each day; otherwise, it must be frozen at extremely low-temperature so that nothing spoils. Now Ram\u00f3n needs a loan that will help him to acquire work tools and equipment to keep his assets in good conditions. Then he will be able to store more product and buy a variety of fish at a greater discount in order to offer his customers a more competitive price. That will generate greater profits, which he can put into savings to provide for the health and living expenses of his golden years with his wife. \r\n\r\nRam\u00f3n is grateful for every grain of sand that is contributed from any part of the world through Kiva so that he can grow his business, because despite his age, nothing has stopped him from striving every day in his work. He is also grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, from whom he has received support, trust, and flexibility\u2014which are lacking in many financial institutions\u2014to increase his working capital.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1335171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Sus ventas las hace de contado, diariamente y abre sus puertas, para atender al p\u00fablico, desde las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 10 de la noche, mientras sus compras las hace a mayoristas de la ciudad, quienes le ofrecen oportunidades de obtener descuentos y ser m\u00e1s competitiva. En la medida en que su mercado crece, los recursos de compra son insuficientes para acceder a estas oportunidades. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar como arroz, aceite, enlatados, embutidos y tambi\u00e9n productos desechables.

It is also where one of the most important football stadiums of Colombia is found, and where professional football teams, such as Junior, the team of the city and of the north coast of Colombia, play.\r\n\r\nHere is where Ailyn has a general store, where she sells foodstuffs, snacks, tins, cold meats, vegetables and disposable items. Her business idea came about 8 years ago through the Turkish roots from her mother, whose strong point was her business activities. Her sales are all cash sales.

","en":"Sahro is a young, hardworking, and cheerful young man of 27 years.  He is married and has two wonderful children.  After finishing school, Sahro was not able to go on to get a higher education because of financial difficulties.  However, he did finish a course, and received certification, in driving cargo vehicles.  For two years now he has had a business working as a commercial driver and earns an income.  His income has enabled him to make many of his dreams come true, like helping his parents and supporting his own family.  He was even able to build his family a new house with all the best conditions for living.\r\n\r\nSahro also has a brother who is planning to marry soon, but he first needs to earn a large amount of money.  Of course, Sahro is going to cover some of the wedding expenses, but they will need money in addition to this.

was created on September 19, 2012. 36 women from five different villages form the group and they are active in business, animal husbandry, and agriculture.  Fama is president of the Village Bank. She is the manager and 36-years old. She is married and mother of five children, three of which are boys.  She is in the business of sheep fattening and the sale of fish at the same time.  She has over three years of solid experience and is an expert in her domain because the whole village only waits for her fish for their meals.

She lives in a home of her own where she constantly works to improve her life.  Flor makes clothing out of lycra and cotton fabric.  She has set up her small but productive workshop little by little in her home.  She designs and makes different articles of clothing.  She tells us that some time ago she worked for another woman who distributed her clothing in a well-known shopping center, but over the years she realized that she could also make her own designs and this is how she began this new phase of her business.  She has already worked in this business for five years and it has remained stable.  What she enjoys the most is that her money moves daily and this generates profit.  Aside from giving her time, she is also happy with the loans she has gotten through MFP because she says that the interest rates are very low.  She would like to have a larger workshop in the future and be able to hire another woman to help her.  On this occasion she is requesting a loan in the amount of 600 PEN.

They live together in their own home. Llerme works as a tailor. Often she works repairing damaged garments, on occasion she accepts personalized designs from customers, and in other instances she herself gets inspired to create new designs and makes her own garments highlighting her own personal style. In addition to making clothing, Llerme also works making undergarments and intimate wear which she sells to her customers, relatives, and friends. Her workshop is located in her home where she added a room where she can work quietly. She has been managing this business for five years and in this time has learned to apply excellent craftsmanship to her work. Previously she worked for a small company, but she decided to start her own business and apply all of her experience she had earned during her time working as a seamstress. She likes what she does because she can work independently, she can set her own hours, and she also has the opportunity to employ other people because during certain seasons she contracts out to others when she has too many orders for her to fill by herself. She is sure the decision she made was the right one, as reflected in the income she now makes. She wishes to continue doing her work and later to have a bigger workshop with more machines and more workers. \r\n\r\nIn this cycle she is requesting S\/. 1500 soles. She is grateful to the donors who make this loan possible and give her the opportunity to continue working to achieve her goals.

Esi will use the loan to purchase an increased amount of maize and cassava, which will aid her in improving her overall \u2018Banku\u2019 sales. Esi wants to use the future profits from her expanded business to ensure that all her children are able to receive an education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1334752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase maize and cassava","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Cape Coast","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.1 -1.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-04-21T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-21T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esi  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":109.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364730859},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":109.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372901887},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":109.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381677901},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":109.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390542097}],"funded_date":"2013-04-21T19:45:03Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":550080,"name":"Fahd","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fahd is a 23-year-old married man with one child.

her dream of achieving a better life for her and her family. Currently, Ekua is an entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nShe prepares and sells banku for a living (a traditional Ghanaian dish made using fermented corn\/cassava dough that is mixed proportionally and cooked in hot water into a smooth whitish consistent paste). She primarily sells her banku in Enyan Apaa (near Cape Coast). Her business enterprise has grown substantially since she began six years ago. She uses the income from her business to help her husband raise their five children. \r\n\r\nEkua has identified that there are growing demands among consumers for her banku.

He lives in a small village in Martvili District with his two children and two grandchildren. Tariel requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows and a calf. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land with 100 nut trees. They sell the dairy products and harvested nuts at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTariel requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Tariel has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Tariel will rent an auto workshop and will work as an artisan to repair cars. He will purchase equipment and pay the rent. He will work hard to increase the monthly income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1334782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to rent an auto workshop and purchase equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Khuntsi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-21T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-21T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tariel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":72.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.26,"local_amount":66.01,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":68.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969182},{"amount":36.05,"local_amount":57.68,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":59.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749602},{"amount":37.45,"local_amount":59.93,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":62.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613508},{"amount":38.13,"local_amount":61,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857225},{"amount":39.2,"local_amount":62.72,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":64.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133878},{"amount":40.59,"local_amount":64.94,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107465},{"amount":41.45,"local_amount":66.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":68.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255014},{"amount":42.82,"local_amount":68.52,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":70.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019165},{"amount":43.83,"local_amount":70.12,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":72.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670310},{"amount":139.22,"local_amount":222.76,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":230.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459140960}],"funded_date":"2013-04-22T06:16:02Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:30:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":550099,"name":"Poli Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Poli is a 45-year-old responsible housewife.

This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, an egg, etc. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price, then she will sell them per piece for a higher price for profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby, and the people in the community. She earns Php 300 a day.\r\n\r\nIn order to expand her inventory, she is requesting a Php 12,000.00 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nJacel desires that her business will continue to grow and she is hoping that her family will have a better living.

adult, Rob was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, an immune disorder. At the time of his diagnosis, drug options were very limited and he began looking for other medical alternatives. When he discovered acupuncture, Rob was enamored by the healing qualities of the treatment. But when his insurance coverage ran out and he could no longer receive treatment, he arrived at two conclusions: first, that he wanted to return to school to study acupuncture; and second, that he was going to develop a business model that would offer affordable acupuncture treatment to individuals who don\u2019t have health insurance.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rob began his own business, <i>City Acupuncture<\/i>. In addition to offering acupuncture treatments, his company also offers massages and sells herbal teas and remedies. Over the next five years, Rob\u2019s business grew and he now employs eight staff and has since performed over 50,000 sessions. However, located in the Wall Street area of New York City, Rob\u2019s business lost power when Hurricane Sandy hit in October 2012. Rob was forced to close his business until the electricity was restored and, even after reopening, many of Rob\u2019s clients were unable to afford or attend their appointments during the aftermath of the storm. After Sandy, Rob realized the importance of offering acupuncture insurance to his clients. This loan will allow Rob to cover the capital costs of becoming an insurance-based business so that he can offer his services to more clients.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Rob\u2019s business,

Avtandil has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Avtandil will purchase a truck and use it for transportation.

His previous loans were invested in doing necessary maintenance on his car and answering most of his family's needs. Today, unfortunately, his loan will be to pay for his wife's medication.

All the hopes and aspirations which she dreamt of with her husband were shattered and tumbled. In spite of all the hardships she faces, Hatshi manages to take care of all her kids by running small income-generating activities like selling rice from door-to-door, selling vegetables and by working in someone else's paddy fields to earn a daily wage.\r\n\r\nThe group is named after Hoikhotin because she was a well known lady in the surrounding areas for her hard work and endurance while she was serving as the only female chief in the village. A member of the group says that she is their inspiration and they look up to her for success. They are proud to call themselves Hoikhotin Group.\r\n\r\nHatshi works really hard to manage the family affairs. Besides selling rice, vegetables and earning a daily wage by working in paddy fields, she also weaves to supplement her income. She taught her second daughter weaving, and now she and her daughter co-operate and weave different traditional woven products. She is able to make a good profit now, but it is never sufficient to make savings. She has to repay the loan amount monthly and also her kids' needs are to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, Hatshi is planning to get sufficient yarns from the market to use for weaving. She has decided to buy the better quality yarns, which she could not afford before, and weave the most expensive traditional wrap skirts for women to sell for a good profit. She wishes to continue her weaving business because she can carry it out irrespective of the weather. Her other activities are affected when there is a bandh [strike] in the area or when it rains heavily. Her dream is to provide her youngest daughter with the best education and support her in all possible ways to let her become an IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officer, which is considered the highest civil service in India.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are engaged in poultry, a piggery, a grocery and vegetable vending. Hatshi thanks Kiva and WSDS for the help and wishes to continue working with WSDS and Kiva. She says, \u201cGod will help and guide you and will never leave you. God bless Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1334683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase different colours of yarn for weaving to sell woven products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-04-22T00:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-22T00:10:01Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hatshi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoinu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimkhovah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-22T04:08:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":550175,"name":"Kitibwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kitibwa is a resident of Mariakani, Kenya.

He also sells the milk that his milk cows give. Narciso relates that when he began to work many years ago, his mother gave him a horse that he later sold to buy a calf, and little by little he acquired his working animals. Now he has several young cows that are always reproducing to do his work in his corn fields, work that he does with the help of workers whom he pays for every day that they help him. Once he harvests the corn, he sells it here in the district to avoid the cost of transportation. His expectations are to continue increasing his herd of milk cows.\r\n\r\nNarciso is applying for this loan to buy calves to fatten.

Francisca is determined not to give up and provide for her children and her father-in-law who suffers from this unfortunate disease.

The intention behind this institute is not only to get money, but to help youth who like to learn develop their skills. She is the breadwinner for her family where she strives to provide household expenses. She intends to furnish her institute but unfortunately, the amount she saved is insufficient to buy what she needs.

Duajhar is a rural village in the Nuapada district of Odisha, India. The group was formed in the year 2009 and consists of four women members who belong to the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category.  Dalimba, sitting second from left with her hand raised in the photograph, is one of the members. She is 32 years old and lives with her husband, one son of 13 years and one daughter of 9 years who are studying in standard 8th and 5th, respectively, in the school in her village.\n\nDalimba has been running a photography and video shooting center in a small rented cabin in her village for the last 11 years with the help of her husband. Apart from this business, her husband is also running a photocopy center in another location. Presently, Dalimba has a computer system, three small digital cameras and two normal video cameras for her business. In the absence of her husband, Dalimba also manages the photo studio. Apart from indoor service, her husband attends outside calls from various social festivals, government programmes and other functions for photography and video shooting. Dalimba earns 6,000 \u2013 7,000 INR per month. This is the fourth loan for Dalimba from Mahashakti Foundation. With the previous three loans, she has added some new assets to help her business. Dalimba says with the first loan, she purchased a screen and a focus light and decorated her studio. With the second loan, she purchased a video camera and with the third loan, her husband purchased a bike to help him in his mobility for outdoor video shooting. This gradual development helped her to increase her income. Presently, Dalimba is earning a monthly income of 6,000 to 7000 INR per month. But this amount is also not sufficient to meet her expenses like house rent, the educational expenses of her children and payment of the workers. So she is planning to increase her income by adding some more assets to her business. With the present loan, Dalimba is planning to purchase another computer and a video camera for expansion of her business. Dalimba's location has a great potential for her business but, due to the shortage of space, she is not able to expand it the way she wants. Dalimba dreams of constructing a photo studio of her own in a central place and giving a better education to her children. \n\nThe other three members of her group are Bhagya, Padmini and Sumati who are doing a fruits and daily need business, a puffed rice business and a general grocery shop with fruits shop and paddy business.\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1332031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a computer and a video camera","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Duajhar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:01Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhagya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dalimba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":96000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":96000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-23T06:18:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":548617,"name":"Majd","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Majd is a 32-year-old married man and has two children.
