","en":"Ayora is an intelligent and hard-working woman. She is 24 years old, single, and lives with her parents. After graduating from high school, Ayora entered the Tajik State University. Following graduation as a software programmer with excellent marks, she stayed at the university and has now worked there as a programmer for over 7 months. Ayora loves her work and spends a lot of time at her job. Lately, she's been falling behind with her household chores - for example, she finds it difficult to find enough time to wash her clothes. Ayora is requesting a loan of US$500 to purchase a washing machine, which will help her to take care of household tasks quickly and spend more time at her favourite job. She is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1334814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

She lives in the Khashuri District with her husband, three children and her parents-in-law. Her mother-in-law is provided with a retirement pension. Natia has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a small monthly salary earned by Natia\u2019s husband, working as a driver at a private company. It is hardly enough to pay for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNatia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

Fresh produce, milk and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

She acquired a loan through the Kyabugimbi group because she had no collateral of her own and therefore, had to depend on the group guarantee. She lives at Kyabugimbi Trading Centre and deals in the coffee and goat trades, which she does on daily basis. \r\n\r\nHer business was started in 2006 to help her earn a living and also meet the basic needs of the family after the father of her children passed on. This situation left the family in a miserable state since the widow did not have any income to survive on.

She started running a food-selling business after she had to drop out of school because her family was too poor to continue her education. She has been in this business for ten years and works every day from morning to night.  At present her main challenge is transportation. Isatu has requested a loan to buy more ground nuts, beans, gari (a cassava-based dish) and native rice. The extra income she earns from this loan will allow her to pay her bills and increase her business. In the future, she plans to expand her food service into a general merchandise business and build a house.

Diomary est\u00e1 pidiendo un pr\u00e9stamo de 10,600 pesos para invertir en el negocio comprando otras pacas. Estas ropas de pacas son usadas y por ende se venden a muy bajo precio, pero mientras mayor es la variedad que se le ofrece al cliente, mejores pueden ser sus ganancias y as\u00ed mismo su calidad de vida.\n\nDiomary es soltera y madre de 2 peque\u00f1os de 5 y 7 a\u00f1os de edad y ambos ni\u00f1os asisten a una escuela p\u00fablica de la zona. Diomary trabaja fuertemente porque quiere proveer alimento y techo seguro a sus dos hijos quienes son la raz\u00f3n por la que se levanta cada ma\u00f1ana para ir al mercado a tratar de vender sus mercanc\u00edas, dando siempre con un trato agradable para sus clientes. En un futuro Diomary quiere tener la posibilidad de construir una peque\u00f1a casa para sus hijos.\n","en":"Diomary has always enjoyed sales and this is why she started her own used clothing and other personal items sales business three years ago.  She heads to the town\u2019s market every day where she occupies one of the sales stands in the market and sets up some of her items on the walls and on tables to exhibit them in a way that will attract the attention of passersby and customers that buy in the market.\r\n\r\nDiomary is asking for a 10,500 peso loan to invest in the business with the purchase of more bales of clothes.  These are bales of used clothes that sell for very low prices so the greater variety she can offer her customers, the better her profits and her quality of life will be.\r\n\r\nDiomary is a single mother of two little ones who are 5 and 7 years of age; both children attend a local public school.  Diomary works hard because she wants to provide food and a safe home for her two children who are the reason she gets up daily to go to the market to try to sell her merchandise always treating her customers with kindness.

It is dedicated to improving the lives of its community members.\n\nMost of the FSA\u2019s members live on less than $1 a day, have little collateral and are therefore unable to access loans through traditional banking services. Its members are mainly farmers and those working in the informal sector, such as shopkeepers, market vendors and tailors. The FSA\u2019s members live in a rural setting and cook over inefficient open fires that produce health-damaging smoke and contribute to the deforestation that is destroying Kenya\u2019s environment. Paradigm\u2019s cookstoves will reduce the toxic smoke by 70% and will reduce the fuel needed to cook by up to 50%. \n\nLangobaya FSA was started in November 2012 and currently stands at 400 members, 60% of whom are women. The FSA disburses business, school fees and agricultural inputs loans at a very low interest rate. It has a repayment rate of close to 100%. The FSA is 100% owned and governed by its members, all of whom own shares of the FSA.\n\nAlmost all the FSA\u2019s members are extremely eager to purchase a cookstove. However, paying for the product upfront presents a challenge. The FSA is unable to raise enough low-interest capital to finance the cookstoves for its members, as business loans make up the majority of the FSA\u2019s loan portfolio. With a loan from Kiva, Langobaya FSA will be able to offer cookstoves to its members in three monthly installments. \n\nWith a Kiva loan, Langobaya FSA will receive 100 fuel-efficient cookstoves from Paradigm and will offer its members manageable financing terms to purchase a stove. This will make the cookstoves accessible to even the lowest income members of the FSA.  \n\nHelp improve the health and financial stability of a rural family in Kenya today!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1331986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cookstove products for sale to end users","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"malindi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-3.216667 40.116667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":286,"posted_date":"2013-04-22T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-22T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Langobaya Fsa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":235.28,"local_amount":235.28,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":235.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020135},{"amount":237.62,"local_amount":237.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":237.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381807988},{"amount":240.01,"local_amount":240.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":240.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390668059},{"amount":246.26,"local_amount":246.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-26T08:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":246.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399913864},{"amount":254.51,"local_amount":254.51,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":254.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410196478},{"amount":183.51,"local_amount":183.51,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-20T08:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":183.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429613827},{"amount":152.81,"local_amount":152.81,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-20T08:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":152.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840308}],"funded_date":"2013-04-22T20:10:34Z","paid_date":"2014-03-20T08:53:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":550339,"name":"Hopewell","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hopewell is applying for a second loan to support his last year of studies at Maharishi Institute.

appears in her Kiva profile photo, with the picture inside the furniture store.\r\n\r\nRanda is a 31-year-old young married woman and a mother to two sons and one daughter. Randa's husband is employed and gets a low salary, which is the only source of income for the family and not quite enough to cover all their needs.\r\n\r\nRanda is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing new bedroom furniture in order to improve the living conditions of her children in her house. Taking this loan will offer Randa's children comfortable and suitable furniture so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Lubna's husband is employed and gets a low salary that is not enough to cover all the family's needs.\r\n\r\nLubna is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from Palestine for Credit & Development (FATEN) to help her cover the cost of purchasing new living room furniture in order to improve the living conditions of her family in the house. Taking this loan will offer to Lubna's family comfortable furniture, so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see in fund-raising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

","en":"Mavluda is a woman with a wonderful soul. She is divorced and has one son. Her son is 26 years old and has no regular work. Mavluda has worked as a cleaning lady in a bathhouse for 12 years. She is very hard working and performs her duties well. Mavluda has a very small salary which is barely enough for living. Mavluda's son wants to travel to Russia to find work there. He is planning to send his earning to his mother so that she is able to buy herself what she needs and have a better life. Mavluda was very happy when she learned about her son's decision. Her son asked his mother to buy him airfare. Mavluda has turned to IMON for a loan since she has no savings of her own. She is requesting 3000 somoni to purchase an airplane ticket for her son.

Khariton's previous loan with KIVA allowed him to resell a large batch of sweets, juices, coffee and other groceries. He made a tidy profit from that venture which he invested in expanding his inventory and his business.

a conscientious, goal oriented and hard working woman. She is 33 years old. She was born in the country side where the climate is supportive of raising cattle and growing many kinds of crops. Hilola's family was poor and she has helped her parents take care of animals and crops since early childhood. Her life has always been hard because her family was so poor. After finishing high school Hilola married and started helping her husband to raise animals and farm. They primarily raise meat cattle by purchasing smaller animals at the livestock market, fattening them then selling the animals with a profits after a certain time. Due to bad weather their cattle business was not successful and Hilola's husband went to Russia to find work. Before he left Hilola's family lived only from their livestock earnings. After her husband left Hilola continued raising animals and now fattens the animals using the feed she grows herself. Last year Hilola's husband returned from Russia to help his wife take care of the cattle. Now he wants to go back to Russia for work. Hilola has turned to Kiva for a loan so that she can purchase airfare for her husband. She herself will continue raising cattle at home.

She will also pay the rent on 21,000 sq. m. of land that she will grow crops on.  This will enable her to grow her crops according to schedule and she will have the security of knowing that nobody else will take away the land she needs for growing her crops.  She will enjoy a good yield which will allow her to build her own home as she currently lives in her in-laws' home and has no privacy.  In addition, she would like to provide her children with an education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1337882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 12 sacks of fertilizers, herbicides and fungicides, and to pay the rent on 21,000 sq. m. of land for cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-04-22T22:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-22T22:40:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvia Yaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215410}],"funded_date":"2013-04-24T02:43:38Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:10:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":550761,"name":"Mehry","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0435\u0445\u0440\u0438 53 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041c\u0435\u0445\u0440\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 12 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442. \u0415\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0439 \u0432\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430. \u0414\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0437 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 6000 \u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443.

She completed secondary school with a degree as a chartered accountant and public accountant. She is married and the mother of 5 children, two of whom are in different grades in primary school. She has more than 15 years of experience growing vegetables like potatoes, broccoli and cauliflower - a skill her parents taught to her from a very young age that has been her family's sustenance for many years and still is. She could not work in her career, so she saw the need to learn a new trade (sewing) so that she can support her husband with their household expenses and cost of food. The land that they plant on was inherited from her parents, and she sells her products to neighbors and intermediaries who come to the area to buy.\r\n\r\nCurrently she asks for a loan to invest in planting potatoes and broccoli through the purchase of fertilizers, composts and fumigation bombs to keep her crop healthy and safe from pests and animals. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to grow a variety of products so that she can offer her customers more options and they will have more choices of what to buy. This will give her more income for her family that she could invest in her crops until she has enough capital to support her students through all of their studies and see them become professionals.

Her story is about the loss of a loved one and how to overcome that pain.  Many people get over the suffering faster than others and some people don't absorb it.  It is easy to remember the things could have been done if that person was still here.  Things come to mind like walks, special lunches, and more things that she could have enjoyed with their brilliant company.  In her case, her father died of liver cancer.  His time was so short that not even the wind succeeded in cooling the tears from that pain.  However, she had a goal, a promise to keep of graduating from technical school, to give him that pride even though he knew he would not be there to applaud in the front row when they called her name.  That was enough to remember and she realized that although people are not always in front of you, they have not abandoned you, and in fact they are more present than not.  \n\nLet them go since they need to be in peace and more than ever they will be waiting with open arms.  It is hard to confront a loss of such magnitude as the death of a loved one.  Unfortunately the way through life is so short it feels that the time is not enough to do or express all the affection for the people who are loved the most.  The loss of a loved one is a fact that cannot be remedied, but there is a choice to maintain a good attitude towards life.  It is important that friends are with one to give encouragement to continue and meet the challenge to come.\n\nSandra thinks about having a prosperous future because she wants to be a technical professional in financial accounting, finish with the best grades, and a high concept that she can defend with an excellent position.

Each one of them runs a business with the goal of improving their families' living conditions: Guadalupe sells refreshments, Teresa sells cosmetics, Lucia Emilia sells chicken, Enriqueta sells shoes, and Maria sells tortillas. This communal bank is located in San Miguel Soyaltepec, which is known for being on the shores of the Cerro de Oro lake.\r\n\r\nTeresa is 30 years old. She completed middle school and she's married to Ivan. They have two children; the eldest one goes to elementary school and the younger one attends preschool. Teresa was taught to work at a very young age. When she got married, she wanted to keep on working in order to help her husband acquire assets for the family they intended to start. That's why she began selling shoes and cosmetics by catalog to her friends within the community. She sells door-to-door by showing her catalogs and taking orders which she then provides and delivers. She reports that she doesn't need to go out to other villages to sell because her community is large. She also reports that since she has been in the business for several years, even on the few occasions when she doesn't go out, people come to her to request her catalogs. What Teresa enjoys the most about her business is that she works during her free time and earns her own money. A loan from Visi\u00f3n Fund will allow her to purchase a variety of perfumes, eye shadows, nail polishes, eyeliners, makeup, lipsticks and shoes.\r\nShe wishes that her business continues to do well so that she can keep on providing her little ones with an education.

He asked her to buy him an airplane ticket to travel to Russia, where he will look for work. Guldasta is requesting a loan of 3000 somoni to purchase the ticket. This loan will help her husband travel to Russia where he will work and send money back home.

However, the main challenge for her is the huge expenses related to transportation back and forth to the workplace from her house. To overcome this challenge, she joins a group of two to apply for a new loan as first-time borrowers. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking 4,000,000 KHR while her joint member is applying for 2,000,000 KHR. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy a decent motorbike to support her occupation.

A previous loan helped Roman purchase fertilizer and pay his workers for harvesting vegetables in his greenhouses. Last year Roman's wife fell very ill. She had a number of surgeries and was not able to help Roman at the farm. Roman himself also had far less time because he was taking care of his wife and not paying as much attention to his business. Now everything is back to normal and everyone works on a regular schedule. Roman is requesting another loan to purchase fertilizer. He has everything else for spring planting. Roman hopes to have a large harvest and sell it profitably.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1336995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-04-23T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-23T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2544.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399834203},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2544.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410109607}],"funded_date":"2013-04-24T01:17:58Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T14:29:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":551357,"name":"Gulizar","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u044e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0435. \u0416\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435. \n\u0413\u044e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u044b, \u043e\u0433\u0443\u0440\u0446\u044b, \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0441. \u0417\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0420\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0413\u044e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440 \u0441 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437\u0435. \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u0413\u044e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c. \n\u0413\u044e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 5,000 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439. \u0413\u044e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0443.","en":"Gulizar grows vegetables on her plot of land.

of Tajikistan. He needs your support, since recently he has had financial difficulties. Kholmurod is 35 years old, married and has a two year old child. His region's climate supports both agriculture and livestock. Kholmurod has been raising livestock for six years. He purchases cattle, fattens them for a few months then sells at the local market for a higher price. He has a lot of land where he can grow hay for his animals. However, Kholmurod needs to improve his soil by fertilizing and irrigating it. He is requesting a loan of 400 US dollars to purchase fertilizer and pay for other farming necessities. He plans to use the profits from this improvement to provide his family with better living conditions. Kholmurod awaits your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1337533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is married and has five children. His children are all adults now and his wife is a skilled seamstress and has her own sewing studio. Sharof lives far away from the city where residents mostly grow crops and raise livestock. He himself has been farming for more then 26 years and grows potatoes, carrots and other crops.

Many people make a living sowing and growing pineapple and sugar cane in this region and the main source of income comes from working in the field.  This group is made of 10 members, each of whom is working with the aim of providing their families with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRubicela is one member of the group.  She is 50 years old and was only able to complete primary school.  She is married to Baldemar and she has one daughter, Iris, who is in primary school.\r\n\r\nRubicela tells us that she has always enjoyed cooking and, one day when she was talking to her husband, she said she wanted to work to help with household costs.  So, with his support, Rubicela began selling Mexican snack foods out of the home on weekends (Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays).  She now has seven years experience in this. She says that she did not have to do any promotional work and customers just came to buy her products.  Rubicela also sells natural products door-to-door in her free time.\r\n\r\nRubicela will invest this loan in buying meat, chilies, tomatoes, onion, oil, tortillas, beans, potatoes, bananas, corn, gas, soft drinks and natural medicines.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her business will continue to progress and that she will be able to build a small hall to sell her foods there.\r\n\"Thank you, Visionfund, for your support.

She completed elementary school and is the single mother of three children, two of whom are currently in different grades in elementary school.  Her youngest is in kindergarten.  Seferina lives with her mother; an elderly woman who is an example to both her and her children as she is a real fighter and has a lot of strength.  She helps out with some of the tasks around the house.\r\n\r\nSeferina's parents taught her to work the land when she was very young.  She enjoys her work and has done so since she was very young.  She enjoyed the learning experience.  This is the only source of income for Seferina's family right now and it has enabled her to improve herself and get ahead in life.  Seferina owns the land that she works, having received it as an inheritance from her parents.  It is located 10 meters from her home and both she and her sister work it, maintaining the crops by fertilizing, weeding, etc.  Seferina's produce is sold through middlemen who visit the area and to their neighbors.  The sisters themselves also travel to a commercial area to sell their produce. \r\n\r\nSeferina is currently requesting help to buy manure and fertilizers for her potato crops as this is how she will keep them healthy and safe from pests and bugs.

He gets up very early in the morning and heads to the city's main port in search of the best products to buy.  He has been in this line of work for one year and he is doing very well.  In the evenings, Anderson works on some infrastructure building work as a heavy machinery operator.  During the time he has spent in his work, he has learned many things.  The experiences he has had have taught him to be more careful with some products and to invest more in others which have a higher demand at certain times of year.  He hopes to continue working hard as his biggest goal is to provide his little ones with a good-quality education.

Now, he is asking for additional capital of PHP 40,000 to buy farm inputs (fertilizers and insecticides) used in farming. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Narciso would like to develop good crops to harvest. This will enable him to better his family's living conditions and someday live progressively.
