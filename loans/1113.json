This group is dedicated mostly to people in the door-to-door business, vending their products on foot in different communities.\n\nEdicto is the hard-working father of six children. He lives with his wife and two of their children; the others are living in their own homes, and some reside in Haiti. He tells us that his biggest challenge is to finish building the family house, and he is still saving his business profits toward this goal. With this loan, he will invest in his business by purchasing products for daily meals to sell like rice, flour, vegetables, meat, cooking oil, some other grocery products; these kinds of businesses are called 'Colmado'.\n\nEdicto is very excited to receive his 13th loan through Esperanza Internacional, after having successfully repaid his previous loan. He has had this business for about eight years. He started the business using the first loan he received from us. His dream is to finish construction on his house and to live quietly in it with his family.

He is married and has four children, who are all still young. His wife Bayonat is a very good housewife. She helps Alisher run the business. He has farmed crops such as onions, carrots and wheat for over 13 years. This year he planted 0.35 hectares of onion, 0.65 hectares of carrot, and plans to also sow wheat. He works very hard to achieve good yields and develop his business. He sells his harvest at the local market. Since he has high quality products, there is large demand for them. Besides his wife, his brother also helps with the business. Alisher would like to plant wheat but doesn't have the money for seed, fuel, and fertilizer. He is asking for a loan of 1000 dollars. He is grateful for your generosity.

Dilshod's wife is a very kind woman. She helps him farm. They have four children. Beside his wife, Dilshod's older brother also helps with the business, since he has over 10 years of experience raising grain crops.  Dilshod knows every aspect of his work, and his tireless labor earns him good harvests. He would like to expand the business and increase its yield. He is asking for a 15,000 somoni loan to buy seeds for the next planting, and also to buy building materials for repairs to his house. He is grateful for your generosity.

She has her own house where she lives with her husband.  Olga's work consists of selling fish.  She has a shop by the fishing docks in the city.  She gets up very early to buy fish wholesale from the fishermen as they arrive with all the fish they've gotten.  She selects the types of fish that are of highest demand among her customers, including harvestfish, catfish, and sardines.  In addition, she stocks up on fish that aren't in such high demand but are available for good prices, including doncella and paiche.  She always respects regulations regarding the season during which each fish can be fished.  She buys her fish wholesale by the basket and sells it by the kilogram.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for almost 42 years, approximately, and says that with this job she was able to feed and educate her son.  She currently works alone and continues doing it because it is the only way of generating income for her home.  What she likes about her job is that she has time in the afternoon to be able to be at home and rest, since she believes that working at her age isn't the same as when she was young.  In addition, she has always been independent and has become used to getting by on her own.\r\n\r\nAt this time, she is asking for a loan of 1500 sols (US$600).  She is very grateful for this loan opportunity that is being offered to her and for this financial support that she needs to keep going.  With the loan, she will buy more fish that are in high demand by her customers, since during this time of year the consumption of certain species goes up.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1338670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy fish wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-24T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-24T13:50:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":226.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":238.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":237.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":256.29},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":265.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":275.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.03},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.42,"local_amount":226.04,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":234.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578201},{"amount":95.41,"local_amount":238.53,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-22T08:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":247.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530455},{"amount":95.03,"local_amount":237.59,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":246.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975481},{"amount":102.52,"local_amount":256.29,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":265.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996750},{"amount":106.34,"local_amount":265.85,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":275.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864225},{"amount":110.28,"local_amount":275.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":286.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352597}],"funded_date":"2013-04-24T15:23:40Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":548927,"name":"Khalida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Khalida is a 37-year-old, married woman.

Este cant\u00f3n se encuentra a pocos kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de Quito, y tiene diversidad de bosques, adem\u00e1s sus barrios est\u00e1n poblados con gente amable y costumbres propias de esta ciudad en donde tambi\u00e9n se encuentran establecidas varias microempresas administradas por los emprendedores que luchan por hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os cada d\u00eda. Otras de las actividades sobresalientes son la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda, produciendo abundantes cultivos que luego son comercializados para distribuirse hacia muchas provincias. Tambi\u00e9n posee varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como cascadas, r\u00edos, senderos, balnearios en donde el turista es atra\u00eddo por los deportes de aventura que se venden all\u00ed con seguridad garantizada. \nJos\u00e9 se dedica a la crianza de ganado vacuno para la producci\u00f3n de leche desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, actividad que hered\u00f3 de sus padres que desde ni\u00f1o le ense\u00f1aron las labores de aseo, cuidado, alimentaci\u00f3n y orde\u00f1o de las vacas.

","en":"Jos\u00e9 is a young man, 19 years old, who is very enterprising and has many goals that he wants to accomplish.  In the future, he dreams of having his own farm with several professionally-cared-for crops to distribute to large buyers.  Jos\u00e9 is single.  He finished high school and he lives with his parents Jos\u00e9 and Elvira in Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pichincha, one of the largest provinces in the Republic of Ecuador.  This canton is located a few kilometers from the city of Quito and has a diversity of forests.  In addition, its neighborhoods are populated with friendly people and typical customs of the city where there are also several small businesses established, run by the entrepreneurs who fight each day to make their dreams a reality.  Other outstanding activities are agriculture and livestock farming, producing abundant crops that are then sold to distribute around to many provinces.  It also has several tourist attractions like waterfalls, rivers, trails and spas where the tourist is attracted by the adventure sports that are sold there with guaranteed security.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has worked raising cattle for milk production for 2 years, an activity that he inherited from his parents who, since he was a child, taught him the labors of cleanliness, care, feeding and milking of the cows.  Now it is an activity that he carries out full time, nine hours each day to which he puts a lot of effort and dedication in order to deliver a healthy product to his customers.  This young entrepreneur is requesting a loan that he will use to buy a pair of young cows to produce more liters of milk a day and thus he will be able to increase his milk sales, which will generate for him a better profit with which he will be able to help his parents with the household expenses and also be able to continue preparing for when he has his own farm to be able to run it professionally.  Jos\u00e9 encourages everyone that can hear about his story through Kiva to contribute with a small grain of sand so that his project can be a reality.  He is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who, in the pursuit of the mission to end poverty in Ecuador, provides so much support to the entrepreneurs and small-businesspeople of the rural areas, with training, personalized counseling and that familial bond that leads to attending to a customer not only with financial services but also non-financial services that ensure the well-being of the customer and their

She is pictured with her hand raised. She is 60 years old and has four sons and two daughters. She is quite old yet she is strong willed. She is a loving mother. Her husband serves as a priest in the village where she lives.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Nenglhing used to buy vegetables from the surrounding villages and sell them in the market. She could make some earnings out of this but the earnings were too small. Apart from the small earnings she made, the job she had taken up was threatening her health because she could not have her meals on time and she had to travel long distances. So she decided to change her business from buying and selling vegetables to raising piglets and selling full grown pigs. By doing this, she needs not go from one place to another and she can keep herself healthy and make more earnings.\r\n\r\nNenglhing now wants to buy more piglets and builds a better pigsty. For this, she needs a sufficient amount of money. So she wants to avail a loan from Kiva through WSDS.

She has been pursuing a business of sewing for 12 years, to support her husband. She accepted the fact that, if her husband were to work alone for their family, they would not be able to meet the expenses of the household and the educational needs of their children.  She sews clothes, bed sheets and covers, and earns enough to contribute to the family income. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRecently, she requested a loan of PKR 40,000.

For social reasons, Fatoumata did not have an opportunity to receive an education, which is why she started earning a living from an early age on. After having tried various business activities without success, some years ago she ended up launching a business buying and reselling firewood and charcoal. In order to satisfy the volume of customer demand and expand the business, three years ago she decided to reach out to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution.

From this business her profit is 500 AZN. \r\n\r\nThere is a big demand for women's clothing in Azerbaijan, and because of this Rahile wants to invest in her store so that she can offer her customers more clothes. Currently, she needs a loan of 2,000 AZN. Rahile is requesting this loan to purchase more goods (like women's underwear, clothes, and shoes) in order to increase the volume of her sales.

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Farming as a business.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Paul replied 'Help pay school fees.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Paul owns the following: 'a cow, poultry, and a bicycle' but does not own 'a pig, a pump, a motorcycle, or an automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household  'a mosquito net and solar power' but does not have 'electricity, running water, a sewing machine, a TV, or a DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

In addition, Tamaz has a truck and he is working on private orders to transport different cargo to earn a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nTamaz requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Tamaz will purchase pottery and wooden wares from the wholesalers at a low cost.

After being involved in several unsuccessful activities, he finally decided to buy and sell smoked fish 13 years ago.  He decided to join Soro Yiriwaso four years ago to increase his business and boost his sales capacity.  He has duly repaid five previous loans and is now taking his sixth individual loan. \r\n\r\nBrehima is planning to buy 10 baskets of smoked fish in Korientz\u00e9 (Mopti region) from Bozo and Somon\u00f4 fishermen [Bozo and Somon\u00f4 people are ethnic groups predominantly located along the Niger river in Mali].  He sells his merchandise at the Koutiala fish market, for cash and sometimes on credit, to both men and women.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, he is expecting to make a monthly profit of 100,000 CFA francs, which will be used to pay off Soro Yiriwaso's interest and to meet the needs of his family. The rest of the money will be reinvested into his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1339215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy some smoked fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T03:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T03:50:08Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brehima  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":168272.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819650},{"amount":333.34,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":168272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924176},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":168272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972026}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T18:14:53Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":550949,"name":"Mwamure","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwamure lives in Tiribe, Kenya.

is 40 years old. She lives in the Batumi district with her mother, brother, sister-in-law and an infant nephew. Irine has requested a loan for her family business start-up from local financial institutions several times, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nIrine\u2019s brother works as an artisan and her sister-in-law works at a local restaurant as a waitress. They both earn a small monthly income. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo's estimates, the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-ups credit with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit Irine will purchase a car. After purchasing a car, she will be able to supply her newly opened restaurant with supplies. Irine has chosen a very good place in the centre of Batumi, where a large number of people live. She hopes the business will be profitable. The new business initiative, financed with a Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1336150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a car and use it to supply her restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Batumi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115.18},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":119.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":128.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":129.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":133.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":135.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":139.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":145.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":145.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":152.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":157.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":160.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":164.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.63,"local_amount":110.63,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":110.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969188},{"amount":115.18,"local_amount":115.18,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":115.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749608},{"amount":119.66,"local_amount":119.66,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":119.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613514},{"amount":120.76,"local_amount":120.76,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":120.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857231},{"amount":123.64,"local_amount":123.64,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":123.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133884},{"amount":1910.13,"local_amount":1910.13,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1910.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107471}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T21:54:48Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margaret Rosen","image":null}},{"id":550959,"name":"Robnison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robinson is an employee with Vision Group where he works as a photographer.

He lives in the Batumi city with his 46-year-old wife, Rusudan, and two children, who are students. Genadi requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGenadi has a car-washing service. Along with washing the cars from the outside, they also wash carpets and get a small monthly income. Rusudan is working as a lecturer at the local university and she is also working part-time at the local children's clinic as a nurse. The total family income is rarely enough to cover their expenses. \r\n\r\nGenadi requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Genadi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Genadi will purchase a vacuum cleaner and also make an advertising banner for his washing service center. With the vacuum cleaner, Genadi will be able to offer better service to his customers and wash the cars not only from outside, but also clean them from inside. With the poster, he will be able to attract more clients, and this will significantly increase his income. Increased income will help Genadi to cover the family monthly expenses and also provide for his children's

Hellen is 21 years old and lives in the town of Mubende in the Mubende region of Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past two years, Hellen has been working hard to manage her restaurant where she sells convenience foods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hellen has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase Irish potatoes, cooking oil and charcoal for the restaurant, and will help Hellen to generate greater profits so that she can take care of her child and her family. Hellen hopes that, in the future, she will be able to build a residential house for herself. \r\n\r\nHellen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1336178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable

Kellen is 18 years old and lives in the town of Mubende in the Mubende region of Uganda. For the past year, Kellen has been working hard to manage her small market, where she sells fresh foods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Kellen has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food, such as raw bananas and cassava, to sell. This will help Kellen to generate greater profits and improve her family's standards of living. Kellen hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a very big retail shop. \r\n\r\nKellen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills
