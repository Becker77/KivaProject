Sarah is 22 years old and lives in the town of Kyenjojo in the Mubende region of Uganda. She is married and has two children who are both currently in school. For the past two years, Sarah has been working hard to manage her stationery shop. \r\nTo help expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more stationery items such as books, pens, staples and computer accessories, and will help Sarah to generate greater profits and improve her family's living standard. Sarah hopes that in the future she will be able to have a very good stable financial life. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1336392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office

Janet is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kisekende in the Mubende region of Uganda. For the past year, Janet has been working hard to manage her small clothing business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Janet has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes to sell, and will help Janet to generate greater profits and take care of her young siblings. Janet hopes that in the future she will be able to own a big boutique shop. \r\n\r\nJanet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Javis is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kisekende in the Mubende region of Uganda. For the past six months, Javis has been working hard to manage her small clothing business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Javis has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy different types of clothes to sell, and will help Javis to generate greater profits and take care of her young siblings. Javis hopes that in the future she will be able to own a big boutique shop. \r\n\r\nJavis is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1336415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Annet is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyenjojo in the Mubende region of Uganda. She is single and has two children, one of whom currently attends school. For the past two years, Annet has been working hard to manage her small farming business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Annet has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more seeds for planting since it\u2019s a rainy season, and will help Annet to generate greater profits and boost her business and even open up a retail shop. Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Hellen is 20 years old and lives in the town of Pallisa in the Iganga region of Uganda. For the past two years, Hellen has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells local brew. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hellen has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more sorghum and millet for making the local brew to sell, and will help Hellen to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Hellen hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own. \r\n\r\nHellen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

The loan will be used to buy more clothes to sell, and will help Afua to generate greater profits and pay rent for the boutique. Afua hopes that in the future she will be able to add in new clothes because she has been selling second-hand clothes. \r\n\r\nAfua is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past three years, Sumaya has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells rice, juice, cooking oil and beans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sumaya has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more maize flour, rice, cooking oil and juice for the shop to sell, and will help Sumaya to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Sumaya hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nSumaya is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Hadija is 22 years old and lives in the town of Iganga in the Iganga region of Uganda. She is married and has two children, one of whom attends school. For the past two years, Hadija has been working hard to manage her small charcoal store. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hadija has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more sacks of charcoal to sell, and will help Hadija to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young child. Hadija hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nHadija is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She's married and the mother of five children. She lives with her husband in the M\u00e9dine neighborhood in Bougouni.\r\n\r\nFor ten years, she's been buying and selling charcoal. She enjoys a strong reputation in this business and receives a lot of orders, mainly from Bamako.\r\n\r\nWith the rainy season approaching, her business is gearing up. She decided to join the loan program of Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso, from which she's seeking her second loan. The first one was repaid without problems.\r\n\r\nShe intends to use this second loan to buy 80 sacks of charcoal from farmers. She will resell it retail and wholesale to a clientele comprising mainly heads of families and merchants coming from Bamako. \r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, she intends to turn a monthly profit of XOF 50'000 (ca US$ 100), to be used to help cover family expenses and repay the loan. She will invest the remainder in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1339289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy charcoal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alimatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:17Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819651},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678545},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924177},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207375},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972027},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624691},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850728},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740389},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459219899},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468044863},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.4,"processed_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":13767.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263007}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T11:01:51Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T20:33:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":551197,"name":"Lorena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorena works hard to support her family.

After finishing secondary school with a diploma in accounting, Yacouba stayed unemployed for some years. Because of this and after long reflection, he decided to learn from his older brother how to buy and sell spare parts and hardware. He has been in this business now for 10 years. \r\n\r\nHaving learned about the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso from a friend, he decided to also join and take out a loan to buy 5 different key rings, some boxes of pliers, some hammers, some screwdrivers, some reels of cable and some switches from the wholesalers in Bamako. \r\n\r\nHe makes his sales in cash and often in credit to customers from all walks of life. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Soro Yiriwaso. The average monthly income of 80,000 francs CFA that he hopes to earn each month will allow him to expand his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1339314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy hardware products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T09:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T09:50:09Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yacouba ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":252408.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678549},{"amount":500,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":252408.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972031}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T22:36:18Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lindsay","image":839627}},{"id":551233,"name":"Linh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linh is 38 years old, and is married.

He was born in a rural area, which is good for animal husbandry and farming. Tochikul comes from a poor family, and he helped his parents raise livestock and farm when he was a small boy. Coming from a poor family, he has gone through many difficult times. After graduating from high school, he got married, and his wife helped him raise livestock and grow crops. He mainly worked at raising livestock; that is, he would buy cattle at a low price, fatten them for a certain amount of time, and then resell them for a good price. This year their business has not been successful, which caused their oldest son to go abroad and work in Russia. Prior to this, Tochikul's family was completely dependent on the income from animal husbandry. In addition, Tochikul needs to repair his house and prepare for his son's wedding. Therefore, Tochikul has turned to IMON to obtain a loan to buy building materials.

My hope is to be able to pass what I have learnt to other people, because it is important to me that I share what I have learnt at Maharishi.\u201d\r\n\r\nList 3 long-term goals:\r\n\"1. Have my own marketing school.\r\n2. Work with various organizations that will help liberate the youth of Africa as a whole.\r\n3. Educate the youth of Africa.\"\r\n\r\nWhy is education important to you?\r\n\u201cEducation is important to me because it helps in different ways. The biggest part of education is the youth -- to liberate the minds and free them from the chains. And now it helps us to achieve the economic freedom that we need as Africans.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhy are you applying for the Kiva loan?\r\n\u201cIt will help me achieve my goals without having to worry about my financial situation and focus on my studies. Finances are the benefit for me, so the Kiva loan will help me to achieve goals. Then I will be able to give back to my community, my country and my continent. It's important to pass it to my continent at large.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat are you hobbies?\r\n\u201cPlaying soccer, going out with friends, creating networks. Most of the time I love reading leadership books to broaden my thinking.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhere are you from?\r\n\u201cI\u2019m from Soweto, born and raised there. I\u2019m the fourth born of a family of six children. I have four sisters and a brother. My family is not privileged but is not doing bad at all. My father believes in education but I could not further my studies because he lost his job. Since then I made sure that I attend to achieve my dreams.\u201d\r\n\r\nAre you the first family member to attend University? Do you have any other siblings in school?\r\n\u201cYes I am the first in my family and no one else has gone to tertiary due to financial constraint. There is only one who is doing grade 4. The others are currently employed in different organizations.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":923.56,"image":{"id":1336188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

her house, which is built out of high-quality materials.  After spending a good deal of time growing organic cacao she decided to take a more dynamic and commercial route and sell agricultural products in her community.  She's been at it for around 5 years and has managed to get herself known by local producers, from whom she buys and safely stores a variety of products like cacao, coffee, achiote, palillo [turmeric], and barbasco.  \r\n\r\nShe says she really appreciates her work because it's not such a strain but it's not so simple either, in that she has to be in contact with wholesalers in the city to get good prices for the products she'll be selling, which also benefits the local producers.   As harvest time for some products approaches, she wants to have financial backing to bring the business along.  She hopes to recoup her investment quickly, along with some extra profit.  This will be her first Kiva loan and she seems very happy and grateful for the opportunity because she can work with greater ease without neglecting to make payments on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1339461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy agricultural products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T14:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T14:30:01Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":422.99},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":457.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":477.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":491.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":508.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":529.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":545.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":567.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.91,"local_amount":422.99,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-22T08:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":427.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530469},{"amount":177.22,"local_amount":457.35,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":462.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975495},{"amount":185.07,"local_amount":477.6,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":482.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996764},{"amount":190.33,"local_amount":491.18,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":496.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864238},{"amount":197.22,"local_amount":508.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":514.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904377},{"amount":205.11,"local_amount":529.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":535.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090460},{"amount":211.27,"local_amount":545.21,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":551.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777249},{"amount":219.87,"local_amount":567.4,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-10T09:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":573.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450599166}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T22:00:17Z","paid_date":"2014-05-10T09:30:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":553325,"name":"Rhuzusanye Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente M\u00e9lanie est pr\u00e9sidente  du collectif d\u2019affaire  Rhuzusanye, entrepreneur,  \u00e2g\u00e9e de 45  ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 9 enfants.

They all have different activities, like selling at fairs, food sales, used and new clothes sales, and bakery, which is what Agueda does for a living.\r\n\r\nAgueda sells desserts in fairs. She started selling popcorn with a cart three or four years ago and she has been selling desserts for two years now. Her siblings have helped her whenever she has had problems to buy ingredients for her desserts.

She believes that everything will work fine in this new cycle, which gives her peace of mind.\r\n\r\nWhat Agueda likes the most of working with Fondo Esperanza is the fact that she can spend time with her friends, with who she built this communal bank.

She has four children and has been doing this work for 13 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan of 62,400 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nAgnes stated what is most enjoyable about farming is, 'Rearing livestock!' Her biggest challenge is, 'Low production due to low-yielding dairy animals.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Cheluk.'  Her highest monthly expense is farming costs. \r\n\r\nAgnes was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, and she said: 'Was first introduced to Juhudi by a friend.'  This client was also asked what she learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How I could boost production through acquisition of assets from an mfi.'  When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Agnes replied 'Will acquire a high yielding dairy animal.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Agnes owns the following: cow, poultry, motorcycle, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending help text:

He works every day for about 12 hours and thinks he does well because of his sense of responsibility and because he knows the areas where the largest number of passengers can be found.\r\n\r\nCristian is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support provided he will be able to buy a small washing machine that will be of great use for him and his mother who despite her age works as a laundress but due to a serious malady is unable to wash by hand and this is why Cristian wants to buy her a washing machine to help with her work and Cristian will continue working and striving towards reaching his great dream of becoming a good businessman; he wants to get ahead with his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1339503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a washing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristian George ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":82.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":86.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":89.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":94.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":97.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":101.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":105.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":109.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":114.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":119.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.91,"local_amount":82.28,"processed_date":"2013-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":85.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483443},{"amount":34.79,"local_amount":86.97,"processed_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":90.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889535},{"amount":35.74,"local_amount":89.34,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":93.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775891},{"amount":76.44,"local_amount":191.1,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":199.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779145},{"amount":40.42,"local_amount":101.06,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":105.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054328},{"amount":42.36,"local_amount":105.9,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":110.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819243},{"amount":137.34,"local_amount":343.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":358.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472205}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T22:05:12Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:24:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":553025,"name":"Choxbajan Tres Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Aura Marina de estado civil casada, cuenta con 33 a\u00f1os de edad, curso 4 a\u00f1os de educacion primaria, tiene 5 hijos y 2 de ellos estan estudiando; ella se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de canastillas, este negocio le fue heredado por sus padres y de esa manera fue como inici\u00f3 y hasta el momento lleva ya 8 a\u00f1os de experiencia.

Mar\u00eda fue madre soltera desde muy joven y por sus hijos ha trabajado duro para poder pagar una educaci\u00f3n digna de la cual ella no pudo gozar ya que por los escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos en su hogar, alcanz\u00f3 a terminar solo la escuela primaria. Esta mujer esforzada sue\u00f1a con ver a sus tres hijos convertidos en profesionales y adem\u00e1s poder ser due\u00f1a de un local amplio donde pueda atender su restaurante. Mar\u00eda vive actualmente en el cant\u00f3n de San Miguel de Los Bancos un pueblo que es muy visitado por las cascadas y biodiversidad de especies que se pueden observar en el paso por sus paisajes. Un lugar due\u00f1o de una exquisita gastronom\u00eda en comida t\u00edpica que es comercializada por varios de sus habitantes y que conjuntamente con hoteles, almacenes agropecuarios y oferta de deportes extremos aportan al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad.

Los fines de semana son  clave para la venta de su comida, por lo que la mayor\u00eda de horas trabaja en estos d\u00edas.

Mar\u00eda has been a single mother since a young age and has worked hard for her children to pay for a proper education for them, something she was unable to have because of her home\u2019s limited economic resources; she was only able to finish elementary school.\r\n\r\nThis self-sacrificing woman dreams with seeing her three children become professionals and also with being the owner of a spacious locale for her restaurant.  Mar\u00eda currently lives in San Miguel de Los Bancos Canton, a town that\u2019s very popular due to its waterfalls and its biodiversity that can be enjoyed in its different environments.  It\u2019s a place with delicious cuisine comprised of traditional dishes that various residents sell and together with hotels, agricultural warehouses and extreme sports contribute to the city\u2019s economic growth.  Also, in the rural zones there are homes dedicated to agriculture and animal husbandry where milk production and production of dairy products like cheese, cream, etc. stand out.\r\n\r\nFor the last two years Mar\u00eda has worked producing charcoal grilled food and is also a housewife tending to her children and giving them the time they require.  Weekends are key to selling her food so most of the hours she works are on these days.  The need to work led this woman to start this activity which was self-taught and based on her own efforts.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda lives in a house that has needed some improvements for some time now which is why she needs a loan now to invest in building supplies and labor costs so that her house will be finished and she and her children can live comfortably and with a better lifestyle.\r\n\r\nShe hadn\u2019t been able to do these improvements previously because her main obstacle was the difficulty in getting a loan. However, thanks to recommendations from some friends she was able to reach out to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who offered her speed, trust and timely advice and also offered Kiva product by means of which many people in many parts of the world can be part of her dream.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1338706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building supplies and pay labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700.52,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":56.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":58.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":60.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":61.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":62.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":64.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.46,"local_amount":52.62,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":54.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133257},{"amount":55.07,"local_amount":53.21,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":55.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313796},{"amount":56.55,"local_amount":54.64,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":56.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565401},{"amount":57.27,"local_amount":55.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":57.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814440},{"amount":58.4,"local_amount":56.43,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":58.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320612},{"amount":59.84,"local_amount":57.82,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856302},{"amount":60.73,"local_amount":58.68,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":60.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059877},{"amount":63.41,"local_amount":61.27,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":63.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995220},{"amount":61.9,"local_amount":59.8,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":61.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413655},{"amount":197.37,"local_amount":190.71,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":197.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102299}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T21:50:55Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":551371,"name":"Sary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sary, 35, is a mother of seven children.

permitieron continuar sus estudios despu\u00e9s de haber concluido la primaria. Se cas\u00f3 con Jos\u00e9 que es un chofer profesional de 48 a\u00f1os y con quien tuvo un hijo nombrado como su padre y que es un adolescente de 17 a\u00f1os a quien esperan un d\u00eda poder verlo recibir su t\u00edtulo profesional. Gloria vive con su familia en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, tras recorrer polvorientos caminos y respirar el aire puro del campo, Nanegalito, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana y que conserva rec\u00f3nditas historias del antepasado de la cultura ecuatoriana. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por los negocios que ofertan deportes extremos que a simple vista se puede ver que son manufacturados con mucha seguridad e ingenio. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos a pesar de que fue una zona que en el pasado no fue muy tomada en cuenta, pues hasta hace poco, muchos no gozaban el beneficio de tener agua potable o luz el\u00e9ctrica.\nGloria se dedica a brindar servicio de transporte en su cant\u00f3n desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, lo hizo con el prop\u00f3sito de mejorar la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en su hogar y juntamente con su esposo aportar a los gastos de educaci\u00f3n, salud, vivienda y alimentaci\u00f3n. Ella aprendi\u00f3 esta actividad desde muy joven cuando acompa\u00f1aba a su padre a transportar las frutas que cosechaban en su peque\u00f1a finca hacia el mercado central del pueblo. Gloria no tiene un horario fijo, pues hay temporadas en donde la visita de turistas es grande e incluso le piden hacer recorridos que le llevan todo el d\u00eda. Un de las tareas m\u00e1s complicadas en su trabajo es el conducir por las noches y en lluvia, pues en repetidas ocasiones las carreteras han sufrido da\u00f1os que no permiten el paso de ning\u00fan veh\u00edculo. El sue\u00f1o de Gloria es un d\u00eda poder comprar una finca para dedicarse de lleno al cultivo y comercializaci\u00f3n de productos agr\u00edcolas, pero mientras eso se cumple seguir\u00e1 esforz\u00e1ndose por hacer un trabajo responsable en su veh\u00edculo el cual debe pasar por mantenimientos exhaustivos peri\u00f3dicos para poder ser matriculado y seguir legalmente considerado como un transporte p\u00fablico por las autoridades competentes, para lo cual Gloria solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo usar\u00e1 para este mantenimiento y tr\u00e1mites correspondientes para tener en regla el funcionamiento de su camioneta que d\u00eda a d\u00eda transporta pasajeros inclusive fuera del cant\u00f3n. Gloria tuvo la oportunidad de conocer a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes le brindaron seguridad y confianza para poder realizar este pr\u00e9stamo, adem\u00e1s la asesor\u00eda que recibe le servir\u00e1 de mucho para administrar los recursos que mantiene hasta el momento y los que recibe como utilidad en su negocio. Esta mujer emprendedora motiva a quienes alrededor del mundo visitan el sitio web de Kiva para que sigan apoyando a tanta gente que necesita el apoyo para salir adelante. ","en":"Gloria, 44, was unable to continue with her schooling after completing elementary school due to her family\u2019s scarce economic resources.  She married Jos\u00e9, 48, who is a professional driver with whom she had a son who is named after his father and who is a 17-year-old adolescent who they hope someday receives his professional degree.\r\n\r\nGloria lives with her family in a rural parish in the city of Quito, capital of Ecuador Province.  Nanegalito is a parish located in northwest Pichincha Province that after traveling dusty roads leads to the pure air in the countryside.  It was home to an Ecuadoran culture which still maintains arcane ancestral stories from the Ecuadoran past.  It\u2019s a place with diverse flora and fauna as well as rivers and waterfalls that are a source of crystalline water that attracts national and foreign tourists because of the extreme sports offered that are clearly designed with safety and ingenuity.  Another source of production in the area is cattle and milk as well as meat production.   In agriculture, sugarcane, manioc, corn, oranges, mandarins and papayas stand out.  Hand-made crafts are also a business opportunity in the zone; they are in demand because of the natural materials like forest seeds that are used to make them.  Because of all this, the local authorities have focused on providing adequate installations so that all of the more than 3,000 inhabitants can have access to basic utilities despite the fact that this zone in the past had been neglected; up to fairly recently they did not enjoy the benefits of potable water or electricity.\r\n\r\nGloria has worked for the last ten years providing transportation services in her canton.  She did so aiming at improving her home\u2019s economic situation and helps her husband with education, health, and housing and food costs.  She learned this activity while very young when she\u2019d accompany her father transporting fruit they grew on their small farm to the city central market.\r\n\r\nGloria does not have a fixed work schedule because there are high tourism seasons and sometimes some of her routes are day-long.  One of the most complicated chores she has at work is having to drive at night and in the rain because highways are often damaged preventing all vehicular traffic.\r\n\r\nGloria\u2019s dream is to be able someday to buy a farm to work full-time in agriculture and selling farm products but until that dream is a reality she will continue striving to work responsibly with her vehicle which must be given periodic exhaustive service and maintenance in order to be licensed and be allowed by local authorities to continue to be used for public transportation.  This is why Gloria is asking for a loan she\u2019ll use to service the vehicle and pay for the corresponding paperwork to have her vehicle she uses daily to transport passengers even beyond the canton in operating conditions.\r\n\r\nGloria learned about Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who offered her security and trust to carry out this loan; she also got advice that will be very useful for her to manage the resources that she still retains and receives as profits in her business.  This enterprising woman motivates those who around the world visit the Kiva site so that they will continue supporting so many people who need support in order to get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1339544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to service her vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nanegalito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1605.75,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":79.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":101.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":103.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":107.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":109.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":111.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":114.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":118.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":120.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":123.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.54,"local_amount":79.59,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":80.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133258},{"amount":96.6,"local_amount":95.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313797},{"amount":199.89,"local_amount":197.52,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":199.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565402},{"amount":102.44,"local_amount":101.23,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":102.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320613},{"amount":105.2,"local_amount":103.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":105.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856303},{"amount":106.54,"local_amount":105.28,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":106.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059878},{"amount":109.23,"local_amount":107.94,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":109.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995221},{"amount":824.56,"local_amount":814.79,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":824.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413656}],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T01:32:39Z","paid_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":553063,"name":"Banco Mujer Aracolpa Ka\u00f1eblocke A\u00f1ita Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Banco Mujer Aracolpa Ka\u00f1eblocke A\u00f1ita, significa es un dialecto Ind\u00edgena Mujeres Trabajando Unidas, es el nombre de este grupo de mujeres ind\u00edgenas que cuenta con una amplia trayectoria con Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer.

The group was formed in 2006 and to date has been granted four loans. The group is made up of eight members, all of whom work in agriculture. The women also belong to their community's Indigenous Woman's Association and through these organizations fight for better living conditions. \r\n  \r\nThe leader of the group is 44-year-old Rafaela who has been married for over 25 years and who due to health problems could never have children. Her husband works as a security officer. Rafaela has always worked in the field; it is what she enjoys doing, and today she grows plantains and bananas. Rafaela will invest this new loan in supplies such as seeds, compost, fertilizer, insecticides, plastic bags and cardboard boxes, among others. This is her way of helping her husband with the household expenses as the income he earns is very little. The previous loans allowed Rafaela to begin planting her crops as well as to grow over the years until she obtained a quality product.\r\n \r\nRafaela's goals are to increase the area of her crop and to ensure she has a small fund for her retirement.

The loan will be used to purchase more maize flour, rice, cooking oil and juice to sell in the store, and will help Esther to generate greater profits and help her family in buying basic needs. Esther hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her store into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nEsther is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past 3 years, Zuena has been working hard to manage her small clothing business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Zuena has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy different types of clothes to sell, and will help Zuena to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young siblings. Zuena hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nZuena is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

According to Pratima, it is very hard to manage her big family and plan for the future development of her business with this small income. \r\n\r\nSo, with the present loan, Pratima has planned to purchase more stock of dry fish for the coming lean season (June \u2013 September). She has a dream to construct a house for her sons and get her daughters and sons married in a respectable manner.   \r\n\r\nThe other four members of her group, Binapani, Anita, Annapurna and Puspa, are running a fruit stall, vegetable wholesaling, milk and general grocery shop businesses respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1337130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase dry fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhawanipatna,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binapani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arnapurna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pratima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":152000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":152000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T01:14:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":551425,"name":"Maa Sarala Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maa Sarala, a Joint Liability Group, was formed in the year 2011 by four active women of Bhawanipatna town of Kalahandi district in Odisha, India.

She previously accessed an 30,000 PHP loan that she used to buy spare parts and accessories and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. Her earnings were a big help in her personal, household, and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan for her to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJesusa dreams to have more jeepneys to expand her business. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known from their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

The more items displayed in her store the better, as more items will result in better profit.  Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s educational expenses.  She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nSusan dreams to have a grocery store and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

His wife has been working at a grocery store before selling clothes at a trade center.  \r\n\r\nHis wife is pregnant and needs some work near her home.  In 2009, he purchased an old wooden house and land from someone and this year he decided to move into this house.  So he is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as fiberglass, bricks, foam, and planks.  Using those materials, he can repair and update his old wooden house.  The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal and release less smoke, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.  The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":1337374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is married to Danilo and mother to their children. She and her husband manage their household while operating a business. They are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nCarmelita maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarmelita hopes that her business will grow bigger. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. This is where she can draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1337381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

city of Kapan.  Loreta is married and has two daughters.  Loreta's younger daughter is married and lives separately from her parents.  Loreta's husband is a construction worker and is away in Russia earning money.\r\n\r\nLoreta has been selling clothing since 2009.  Right now Loreta rents a stall at the market in her native city of Kapan and sells clothing that she brings monthly from the wholesale markets in Yerevan and neighboring countries.  Her older daughter, who is a financial analyst helps her with her business.  After many years of selling clothing Loreta has a lot of regular customers who prefer to buy clothing and shoes for their families from Loreta's store.  In small cities like Kapan it is very difficult for women to find job and to take care of their families and Loreta is very happy that she can handle these difficulties on her own, but as she admitted without her husband's help, who works abroad, she would not have been able to manage.  \r\n\r\nKapan is one of the southernmost cities in Armenia and there is almost no spring there, starting in April it is already summer weather there and this is why Loreta decided to purchase a large lot of clothing from Yerevan a little bit earlier.  Loreta is asking Kiva lenders for a loan of 2,400 US dollars for the purchase of women's, men's and children's clothing, sleeping attire and shoes for resale in Kapan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":1337981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

His wife also specialized in architecture and now performs interior work on contract with building companies. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and needs some serious repair. He is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, planks, iron, fiberglass, foams, gypsum and dry boards. Using those materials, he can repair and insulate his house, and the renovated house will enable the family to live in a comfortable and warm place. More importantly, the family will reduce its coal usage, release less smoke and then contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

The loan will be used to buy more clothes to sell. This will help Jovia to generate greater profits and improve her standard of living. Jovia hopes that in the future she will be able to boost her business. \r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

He is married and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past five years, Jackson has been working hard to manage his small clothing business, in which he sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Jackson has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock more cartons of clothes to sell, and will help Jackson to generate greater profits and improve his family's stadands of living. Jackson hopes that in the future, he will be able to expand his business into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nJackson is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small-scale entrepreneurs like Jackson who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1330580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He currently lives with his in-laws alongside his wife and son.  Elmer makes a living as a panel beater in a mechanics' workshop.  He leaves his home very early to arrive at his work, located an hour away.  Elmer's father-in-law helped him get this job after working with him for three years.  In the beginning Elmer had a lot of difficulties as he did not know anything about the business.  However, little by little, thanks to his determination and responsibility, he has learned the job and improved the services he offers.  Now Elmer's customers leave very happy with his work and Elmer is becoming known and is taking on extra work independently.  Elmer is thinking about starting his own workshop in the future.  With many years of experience Elmer was able to find this stable job and now with the money he earns from jobs on the side, he has been able to buy himself a motorbike for getting to and from work, thus saving him money on transport costs.

Jenefer joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough food for her family and use her increased profits to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nJenefer described her harvest as very good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year. She plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to buy a cow and send her children to school. Jenefer\u2019s group members will each receive input loans of \u00bd acre during the 2013 Long Rains season. In total they will receive inputs for nine acres of millet and sorghum.\r\n\r\nRose, one of the farmers of Inuka Group, chose to drop out of the program after this Kiva photo was taken. She is still pictured above.
