She is married to Manuel, who has a job, and they have two children.  They live together in their own house.  Irma has a business selling meals at the weekend.  She has a small space on the pavement outside her home for her business and it is there that she sells typical, regional dishes such as \"juanes\" (a rice and meat dish), fried chicken and roast meats.  Irma always offers friendly and polite service to her customers.  She starts very early when she goes out to buy her ingredients for the dishes she will be selling each day.  She has had the business for 16 years and receives support from her daughter and daughter-in-law to attend to customers.  Irma likes her business as it has brought her a lot of financial and personal satisfaction.  She says that the work does not require much physical effort and so she is able to move forward in life.  Irma would like her work to remain stable so that she may continue to work.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMary Jane hopes that her business will grow and dreams to have more business.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1337457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-04-26T13:30:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-26T13:30:26Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364489192},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894817},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.04,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381669857},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534390}],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T14:11:21Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:29:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":551585,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivic, 38 years old, is married and lives in Tukuran, Zamboanga Del Sur, with three children.

She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. The client received the first part (tranche) of the start-up loan, which will be used to buy green bean, tomato and cabbage seeds. Within 30 days after loan disbursement, Credo will monitor the client and, if the loan purpose has been met, will disburse the second tranche, which will be used to hire agricultural workers to help Nina in developing her farming business.

Her profits from her business will definitely help her cover their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nLolita dreams of a continuous growth in her business.

He lives in Kianeti village, Bolnisi District with his 59-year-old wife Nanuli.  Tamaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they own a plot of land and a vineyard. Tamaz cultivates the land and plants different kinds of fruit and vegetables. Harvested grapes are used to make vodka and wine. They are sold with the harvested fruits and vegetables at the local markets. The family also has a pig and four piglets. Nanuli is looking after them. Later when piglets are grown they will be sold as meat.\r\n\r\nTamaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Tamaz will purchase two milk cows. They will be milking the cows every day and making dairy products. The products will be sold at the local markets and among the villagers so the family will be able to earn a good profit. Part of the profit will be used for reinvesting in the same field, in order to expand their agricultural business and another part for covering their monthly expenses. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1337532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To purchase two milk cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kianeti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-26T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-26T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamaz ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":151.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":154.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":158.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":164.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":176.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":181.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":187.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":191.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.43,"local_amount":146.01,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":148.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969192},{"amount":89.71,"local_amount":146.47,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":148.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749612},{"amount":93.07,"local_amount":151.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":154.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613518},{"amount":94.68,"local_amount":154.58,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":156.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857235},{"amount":97.26,"local_amount":158.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":160.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133889},{"amount":100.56,"local_amount":164.19,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":166.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107476},{"amount":102.63,"local_amount":167.56,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":169.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255024},{"amount":105.91,"local_amount":172.91,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":175.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019174},{"amount":108.3,"local_amount":176.81,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":179.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670318},{"amount":111.24,"local_amount":181.62,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":184.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459140967},{"amount":232.21,"local_amount":379.12,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":384.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467956726}],"funded_date":"2013-04-28T13:19:51Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:17:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":551643,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This marks Susan's third loan.

adored son who is her main reason for living.  She is a very kind, hard-working, enthusiastic person who dedicates all her efforts to providing for her family, since she is both mother and father to her son.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources and out of necessity, she has had to work since she was very young.  Esther was unable to get training in pastry making as she would have liked, but in her free time she prepares delicious desserts to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, and with much tenacity and dedication, Esther works as a hired hand on a farm in her city.  She works every day, an average of ten hours daily, and believes she is doing well because of her hard work and kindness to others.\r\n\r\nEsther is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she will be able to rebuild one of the walls of her home.  It is currently in disrepair and needs to be reinforced.  This will mean more safety and well-being for Esther and her family, allowing her to continue working toward her goal of having her own bakery."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1339710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of time and money to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and meals costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nElisa dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

She is married to Limo and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnaliza runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Analiza's case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in poor urban communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in a public market in a poor, urban area, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP to buy additional stock of used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, as well as used bags and footwear. If she can reinvest the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nAnaliza dreams that her business will continue to grow.

","en":"Abdusalim is a kind, 60 year-old man.  He is married and has two adult children.  Abdusalim's children and their families live in their house in a small village, and this is why it can be said that they have a big and friendly family.  All of them try to work together to earn income for their big family.  Abdusalim's wife works at a dekhan farm, and the oldest son works as a construction worker in Russia and earns a stable monthly income, which he sends to his family.  Abdusalim is involved in fattening up small livestock.  He has been involved in this type of business since his youth and has an extensive experience in this field.  But also his main profession is driving a truck.  He has been working as a driver for 30 years.  He also earns an additional income working as a truck driver.  Abdusalim dreams that his children and grandchildren lived with plenitude and this is why he works without putting his hands down.  Now he plans to build a house for his oldest son, where he would live with his family.  But this requires a large sum of money, and this is why Abdusalim wants to obtain a loan to buy small livestock in order to expand his business.

His dream was to feed people \u2013 many people.\n\n\"First comes the dream, then the idea,\" he says. \"Then the dream can come true.\"\n\nWaldo opened two businesses: Divine Taste Catering, and restaurant, El Ceviche De Waldito. He says cooking is his calling and he uses his mind, heart and talents to satisfy customers with his authentic Peruvian and Caribbean dishes.\n\nBorn in Peru, Waldo attended a culinary arts school before moving to Miami, where he studied business hospitality before moving to San Antonio.\n\nFollowing his dream, 50-year-old Waldo did everything he could to make the most of his funds. He says when a person has less than $200, \"This is the time you use your brain; this is the time you use your heart and say, 'Yes I can.'\"\n\nWith no vehicle, he and his wife walked to H-E-B, a Texas grocer, for food. They searched trashcans for valuables like chairs and tables they later cleaned and tightened for use in the restaurant.\n\nAfter learning about Accion Texas Inc. at a function for small businesses, Waldo applied and was approved for a loan he's using to build his credit.\n\nExcellent credit history and scores are judgments of a person's future ability to make large purchases, such as when purchasing any type of vehicle or home. If a person has great credit, they seem more likely to repay on-time, and are more likely eligible for a line of credit to make large purchases.\n\nWaldo says, \"When you see the opportunity, don't let it go. It's yours, don't let it go.\"\n\nHe says, \"Accion Texas is like part of the dream come true. I feel covered, I feel like, behind me, there's someone holding my head and my arms named Accion. I don't feel alone.\"\n\nA religious man, Waldo never worried if his business would be successful because he says, \"If one is good in life, they'll be rewarded.\"\n\nAfter two years, he has four employees, four cars and a restaurant where he's served Spanish singer-songwriter Julio Iglesias, President Clinton and Vice President Gore, Mayor Julian, his twin brother, Joaquin, who is a U.S. House Representative, hotel chefs, as well as members of the community.\n\n\"I'm not small. I'm a big guy. Maybe if you see me, I'm a short guy, but I have a big heart,\" he says adding, \"I say, God, thank you for giving me this experience.\"\n\nWhen he can, Waldo says he likes to give back to the community, donating his culinary talents to causes. Now that he has a restaurant, he has new dreams to open a community center, start a scholarship fund for parents who think they are too old to return to school, and fundraise with his food to help pay medical bills for families with cancer-stricken children. But, Waldo says he is taking his dream one step at a time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":1327690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

This is why Abdumajid spends the majority of his time being involved in this business.  He takes livestock out to pasture every day.  He cleans the cowshed and maintains control over the cleanliness and health of cows.  Abdumajid specifically prepared a place for cows, where they go to a pasture during the day.  He skillfully transformed a former canal that once had water into a small pasture.  Abdumajid's children are already grown and work on their own.  They help their father and mother financially.  But Abdumajid is not used to sitting put with his hands down.  He has his own livestock, from which he finds his own income.  His wife milks the cow and also earns money selling milk.  Abdumajid wants to take advantage of the season and buy a cow and feed.  He came to MDO Arvand with hope.  He is grateful for the help and trust in providing him with a loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1335943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy \u0441ow and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-26T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-26T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdumajid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":183.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":187.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":192.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":196.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":205.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":210.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":215.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":220.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":225.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":230.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":232.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.5,"local_amount":183.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":183.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971489},{"amount":187.72,"local_amount":187.72,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":187.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752011},{"amount":192.04,"local_amount":192.04,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":192.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616099},{"amount":196.45,"local_amount":196.45,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":196.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859968},{"amount":200.97,"local_amount":200.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":200.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136713},{"amount":205.6,"local_amount":205.6,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":205.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900908},{"amount":210.32,"local_amount":210.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":210.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550090},{"amount":215.16,"local_amount":215.16,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":215.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774315},{"amount":220.11,"local_amount":220.11,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":220.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673447},{"amount":688.13,"local_amount":688.13,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":688.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144244}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T01:28:04Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":551721,"name":"Tenneh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tenneh lives in Bardnersville, one of the populated areas in Montsorrado County.

He was an apprentice to a master carpenter since childhood and learned all of the nuances of this business.  Gradually, he started working independently.  He took orders at home.  He earned money with his work, helped his parents and got married.  Now Jamshed has his own family, but they live together with his parents.  He has been working at a private company that makes and installs plastic windows for two years.  Today, Jamshed and his family have a need to purchase a car and he wants to buy one, so that his parents and wife had no difficulties with transport.  Currently, Jamshed does not have the required sum of money to buy a car.  He learned from his friends about financing and came to MDO Arvand for a loan.  He hopes for support from Arvand and is grateful in advance for the assistance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2950,"image":{"id":1335648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal

She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to commercial credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Telnaz will begin a clothing business.

He is married and the father of many children. He has six beautiful children. His two eldest sons are working in Russia, where they repair apartments and get a good income that they send to their parents monthly. The remaining children are still in school. \r\n\r\nBekmirzo and his wife are engaged in their own business in order to have the income to meet family needs. Previously, Bekmirzo worked on a collective farm, but there he received a small salary which was barely enough to live on. As a result, he decided to leave that job and to start his own business. He started growing vegetables and fruits, as well as fattening livestock. He rented a small plot of land and, getting a good harvest each year, increased his income, and soon purchased the land. \r\n\r\nThis year, he planted wheat because it is easier to grow. Bekmirzo's wife helps to care for the crops. But the main activity is of course fattening and selling livestock. This kind of business brings the main income for his family. \r\n\r\nBekmirzo now plans to expand his business and wants to buy livestock for further fattening, and he will graze the livestock on his plot of land. His accumulated funds are not enough for the purchase of livestock, so he wants to get a loan from Arvand and hopes for support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1336001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-26T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-26T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bekmirzo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":765.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":791.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":818.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":845.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":874.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":904.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":164.57,"local_amount":765.45,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":782.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550093},{"amount":170.15,"local_amount":791.4,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":809.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774318},{"amount":175.92,"local_amount":818.23,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":836.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673450},{"amount":181.89,"local_amount":845.97,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":865.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144247},{"amount":188.04,"local_amount":874.64,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":894.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960076},{"amount":194.43,"local_amount":904.31,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":925.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180850}],"funded_date":"2013-05-19T00:56:06Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T13:08:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":553175,"name":"Po Yoayu Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Po Yoayu est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 5to.

of 41. He is married with two beautiful children. \r\n\r\nThroughout his life, Mahmud has been involved in animal husbandry. He knows very well all the advantages of this business. At home, he has five heads of cattle and two dairy cows. The dairy cows are cared for by his wife. She feeds and milks them. Every day, they get 10 liters of milk and Mahmud's wife produces yogurt products and sells them to acquaintances and neighbors. Additionally, Mahmud is engaged in mid-sized village farming on \"dekhan\" farms. But the main source of income is fattening cattle. \r\n\r\nMahmud is trying to expand his business and hopes to use the loan to buy another cow and feed for the cattle. Mahmud thanks Arvand in advance for the help and

She lives in Borjomi district with her 46-year-old husband, 22-year-old daughter (Natela) and 23-year-old son (George). Nana has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for the family business start-up but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The main source of the income for the family is the monthly salaries of Nana and her children. Nana is working as an old man\u2019s nurse; her son is working at the local TV station as an operator; and her daughter is working at the local shop as a seller. In addition, Nana\u2019s husband is getting a small monthly pension from government institutions as he is a war veteran. \r\n\r\nNana requested loan from Credo to start up the family business. Nana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Nana will renovate her house. She will purchase all the needed materials and pay the artisan. After the house is renovated, Nana will rent the rooms out during the summer season. Because Borjomi district is becoming very popular as a tourist area and every summer is very crowded, Nana hopes her business will be profitable. New business will significantly increase the family income, and Nana will be able to provide better living conditions for her family.

She is married and has two children, who are still young. Her husband is a simple worker and receives a small salary, which is not enough for providing the family with all it needs. Therefore, Nazira is working hard to earn more money. \r\n\r\nNazira works in a salon located in the city where she lives with her family.  Due to good service, she has her own customers.

Keketso is 24 years old and was asked the following questions by a staff member of the Institute:\r\n\r\nWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute and what classes do you enjoy most?\r\n\u201cI am currently studying Business Administration at the Maharishi Institute with the intention of obtaining first a Bachelor of Business Administration degree and then a Masters of Business Administration degree.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after graduation?\r\n\"My ultimate goals are to become a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of at least two companies that are not my own, and also establish my own organizations, both locally and internationally. I have a wide variety of interests; thus the sectors in which I will work include mining, banking, health, insurance, public sector, energy and fashion. I see myself becoming a global citizen; thus I intend to work in different cities, meaning that I will get to travel and also see first-hand how my international organizations are progressing.\"\r\n\r\nTell us about your background?\r\n\u201cI was born in Gauteng in a township called Vosloorus. I was, however, raised by a single parent, my mother, as my father passed away a year after I was born. I am the only child at home. My mother is a self-employed seamstress, and that is how she is able to provide for us and put me through school. She is my source of inspiration, as seeing how hard she worked to educate me motivates me, and this has shown me that nothing is impossible when hard work and passion come together.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\r\n\u201cIn my spare time I read, write and jot down all of the business ideas that I get and also plan on how I will start and manage my business. I also design clothing and volunteer at orphanages.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow will the Kiva loan change your life?\r\n\u201cThe Kiva loan will make a significant difference in my life, as making ends meet has been a big challenge since I began pursuing this degree. With this loan, I will be able to not only pay for tuition, but also pay for most of my basic necessities. This loan will help ease the pressure I experience when there are financial costs that need to be covered, and I don\u2019t have the means to do so.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":461.04,"image":{"id":1337549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She works in her household and also helps in the harvests, a craft that she learned since childhood. \nEven though Mercedes loves working in the fields, she acknowledges that her entire family suffers from the vulnerability of food prices, so she would love to help and make their lives more confortable and less economically strained, by acquiring a solar home system.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. George trades headstones.  He purchases from re-sellers in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, at wholesale prices and brings it to the Gori district. Headstones are sold from his house to the villagers, and George gets a small monthly salary, which is the only source of the income of the family. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, George will open a shop that specializes in headstones. \r\n\r\nAs George already has a commercial space, he will economize on renting expenses. With the shop George will be able to keep more stock of headstones and serve more clients. This will significantly increase his income. Part of the profit will be used for reinvesting in order to expand his business, and another part will be used for covering the family's monthly expenses.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He is married, and has two children aged three and six. He has one additional dependent who lives with him to help his brother with his education. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Miniru established his provisions, drinks, toiletries, and recharge card business. He began his business because he wanted to be self reliant after dropping out of school. His business is located in the outskirts and his main customers are adults. Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, he earns about SLL 2,300,200 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Miniru has already received and successfully repaid five loans, and now requires a new loan in order to pay for additional soft drinks, cigarettes and mayonnaise. He hopes that this loan can improve the stock and raise the profit. In the future, Miniru plans to open an outlet in the center of town.

She is married and has three children aged seven, twelve and 23. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her to help with the house chores. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Hawa established her provision, toiletries, drinks and African-dress business. She began her business because she wants to help her retired husband to run the affairs of the home. Her business is located in the outskirts and her main customers are adults of all sexes. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,589,000 every month from this business.\r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000. Hawa has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy additional mayonnaise, powdered milk and laundry soap.

The ladies are about to take their second loan from Friendship Bridge and this is also their second loan cycle trough KIVA. In the previous loan cycle, there were 9 women in the Trust Bank. However, for this new loan cycle, there are two additional members bringing the total to eleven business women. Their average age is 34 years and each has an average of four children. The capital from the new loan cycle will be used to boost the productivity of their businesses which will not only be valuable to them but also to their families and the community.\r\n\r\nIn the first loan cycle, we reported about a young 25-year-old woman named Olivia. Because of her loan and her diligent efforts, she was able to increase her business, keep her two boys in school and enroll herself in the 5th grade which she attends over the weekends. Olivia is eagerly awaiting another micro loan!\r\n\r\nBrenda is an 18-year-old single mother of a beautiful daughter who is 14 months old. She was only able to attend school until the 7th grade as she had to take care of her daughter and needed to work to support herself and her daughter. In thinking of the future of her baby girl, she thought carefully about what she wanted to pursue and decided to begin to sell fruit. She works seven days per week and happily, the business is growing and doing well. Brenda wants to inject more capital into her business and for that reason; she is applying for her first loan from Friendship Bridge. She looks forward to purchasing more fruit and increasing her inventory.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank \u201cShalom\u201d appreciates the confidence and support of KIVA investors not only for this second loan but also for the previous one. Brenda sums it up when she says, \"We are aware of the commitment we have made and will carry out our responsibilities positively and successfully.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5725,"image":{"id":1337893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Taking this loan will offer Saeed and his family comfortable furniture so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her latest loan was invested in the business, where she sells decoration items.\r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business, and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house, at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nJoaquina wants to start building her house with this loan. She is needing to improve her house condition, since they are living in a deteriorated home structure, and she is taking this loan for that purpose. So now she is requesting this loan to buy cement and concrete blocks to start building her house walls. \r\n\r\nJoaquina wishes to have a safe and nice home, also to have a vocational school to teach people to decorate and make crafts.

Rita's meat products are very famous and popular in Vanadzor city and Lori area. \r\n\r\nAfter 20 years she has a large number of customers who prefer to buy meat products from Rita, because they have a unique taste and aroma. The meat production income allows Rita to meet her little family's needs and to pay for her son\u2019s education.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000 to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMargarita hopes that her business will be very successful and dreams of having a better standard of living.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Anie is requesting a loan of PHP 15, 000. She will use the loan to buy more raw ingredients like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLaura has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nLaura requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Laura has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit, Laura will rent a counter and begin a jewelry trade. She plans to purchase different kinds of jewelry and gold products for resale. As her husband is involved in the jewelry business, she hopes that it will be profitable.

The lady sitting in the front with a raised hand is Pira. She lives with her six-member family comprised of her husband; four sons, ages 30, 28, 25 and 20; and one daughter, age 22. She is a very energetic, hardworking and enthusiastic person who always devotes her time to getting her family ahead.\r\n\r\nPira herself has been running a general grocery shop for nine years to maintain her family. Initially, she started the business with a low profile selling limited items like potatoes, soap, sugar, tea dust, tobacco, chocolates, etc. Gradually she expanded her business and added extra items regularly. Apart from this, her two sons have two barber shops and the other two sons are working at other barber shops on a daily wage basis.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2010, Pira and three other women of her locality formed a joint liability group named <i>Jai Durga<\/i> and took out a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their businesses. This is the second loan for her group.\r\n\r\nWith the first loans, Pira has been able to add some grocery items like dough, oil, spices, etc. Now she is earning 300 Indian rupees daily from her business \u2013 which is very scanty to manage her big family. To add some extra income, Pira wants to add soda and cold drink items to her shop. So, with the present loan, she has planned to buy a refrigerator and cold drinks along with other merchandise to increase her sales and income for her overall development. Pira hopes to build a permanent house for her family and get her sons and daughters married off in a respectable manner.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group, Sarmistha, Sanju and Haripriya, are running a tailoring center with tent house, a dry food and tiffin hotel, and a welding center respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1338181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for a refrigerator and cold drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhawanipatna,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-27T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-27T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarmistha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haripriya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":116000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":116000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T17:34:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":552172,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Francis, a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines.
