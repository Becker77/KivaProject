rural village named Salepali in Kalahandi district of Odisha state in India. The lady standing on the extreme left with an orange-colored sari is Sebati. Sebati is running leaf plate manufacturing and dry food businesses and her husband works as a carpenter. He also cultivates paddy (rice), maize and vegetables. From the above Sebati\u2019s family get a monthly income of 4000 INR which makes it very difficult to manage her family's budget. \r\n\r\nThe village Salepali is very remotely located and people depend on the nearby town for all things. 98% of households in this village use fuel wood for cooking purposes. In the present situation it is very hard and expensive to get fuel wood. So the people of this area are wasting their time, money and energy to obtain it.\r\n\r\nWhen Mahashakti Foundation introduced its cook stove loans, a demonstration meeting was organized in this village. In the meeting the usefulness of the cook stove--less smoke, fuel saving, less fuel cost up to 50% and time saving points--were discussed which impressed people. To get this loan Sebati formed a Joint Liability Group named Maha Laxmi, taking three other like-minded women of her village  as members. \r\n\r\nFrom this loan Sebati is planning to purchase a cook stove which costs Rs.2400\/- . She thinks that this smokeless stove will help to save fuel wood, save time, and protect her from the bad effects of smoke. This also indirectly supports environment protection. She hopes it will also help to develop her current business so she can earn more income for better living. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Labanya, Sumani and Sumitra.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1338290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing a cook stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"SALEPALI,KALAHANDI,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-27T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-27T13:50:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Labanya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":9600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":9600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-27T18:07:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":552244,"name":"Fateh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Fateh is a 56-year-old energetic married woman and the mother of three children.

It totals 220 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Irma has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Irma will begin a trade in clothing and bedclothes. She plans to purchase clothing and bedclothes in Turkey and then resell them among her villagers at a higher price. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Jacob is 23 years old and was asked the following questions by a staff member of the Institute:\r\n\r\nWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute and what classes do you enjoy most?\r\n\u201cI study at the Maharishi Institute because it mainly deals with human development, reaching my full potential. I enjoy the daily TM (Transcendental Meditation) and Sidi-program (Advanced Techniques) and currently I enjoy the economics class. Algebra is also my favourite.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after graduation?\r\n\u201cAfter graduation, I would love to work as a financial analyst and work at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. A couple of years thereafter, I would like to open my own consulting company. I would love to work in London, UK, but my heart will always remain in Africa, where I\u2019d also open offices around the continent in order to play in the development of Africa\u2019s wealth.\u201d\r\n\r\nTell us about your background?\r\n\u201cI was born in Tembisa and grew up in Johannesburg all my life. I have a 34-year-old brother. My mother works as a domestic worker and I have been living with her as a single parent. My father works as a mechanic, but he hasn't played a huge role in my life until recently, when he has shown initiative and added some support. I am grateful for both my parents. I have a 3-year-old beautiful daughter who currently lives with her grandparents in Limpopo and, as a young father, I want a better life for myself so that she also can have a better future.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\r\n\u201cI like collecting books. I read motivational books, business books as well as spiritual books. I also play lots of sports, mainly soccer and cricket.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow will the Kiva loan change your life?\r\n\"It will help me achieve my goal of graduating and help me with having no financial burden after graduating, since I will be repaying the loan at a reasonable rate. It will also help me with travelling expenses \u2013 meaning there will be no excuses for me not going to school.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":455.42,"image":{"id":1338405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

I enjoy English, Maths and Business Fundamentals classes.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after graduation?\r\n\u201cAfter graduating, I want to be a financial manager, and I also want to start my own transport company in the area where I grew up. I would like to work in Pretoria, and I would like to travel and see different places.\u201d\r\n\r\nTell us about your background?\r\n\u201cI was born in Tweepoview, Mpumalanga. I have one sister and one brother, but we are also living with three cousins whose parents passed away. My mother is working in a clothing factory, and she is a breadwinner because my father passed away in 2009. I am not yet married, and I do not have any children.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\r\n\u201cI spend time with my family, I read motivational books, and I also hairdress people to get myself pocket money.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow will the Kiva loan change your life?\r\n\u201cKiva will change my life because I am coming from a poor family. My mother was struggling to pay for my studies and even to pay for my accommodation. So Kiva will help me to pay my tuition and also my living costs. This loan will not affect my studies and my lifestyle.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":476.56,"image":{"id":1338362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, with his wife and son. Vazha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nVazha is a hired worker at a local bread factory, making a total of 300 Laris (GEL) per month, which is the only source of income for the family. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nVazha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Vazha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

His loan request was rejected each time, because of their low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. They have two milk cows. The cows are milked every day and family makes dairy products, which are sold locally at the markets. Gela\u2019s sister is working at the local shop as a seller and gets a small monthly salary. Additional family income is from Gela\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly pension.  \r\n\r\nGela requested a loan from Credo to start-up the family business. Gela has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Gela will purchase chicks. He already has cages ready and will raise them. After the chicks are grown they will be sold at the local markets, and Gela will earn a good profit. He will reinvest part of the profit in the same business, in order to develop their poultry, and he will use another part for the family's well-being.

Wiseman is 19 years old and was asked the following questions by a staff member of the Institute:\r\n\r\nWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute and what classes do you enjoy most?\r\n\u201cI am studying (for) a Bachelor of Business Administration degree. I enjoy most finance, accounting and business classes. I also enjoy consciousness-based education (CBE).\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after graduation?\r\n\u201cAfter graduating, I would want to work as an auditor for any company, but at a later stage start my own company of chartered and accountancy. I would live all around the world in different countries. I would like to travel more and understand the doing of other businesses all around the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nTell us about your background?\r\n\u201cI am the firstborn of a family of three boys and three girls, in which we are six. My father is a breadwinner; my mother is a housewife. We all are still in school. My hobbies are reading, writing and listening.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\r\n\u201cI spend my spare time reading; if not, then I\u2019m in church with church-mates. Some other times I do community work in the old age homes for other people who cannot help themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow will the Kiva loan change your life?\r\n\u201cA Kiva loan will help me a lot in the field of my studies. It will decrease the expense from my father\u2019s pocket, and it will help me worry less on whether I'll be able to pay my tuition on time or not. A Kiva loan will change a lot of things. I will now concentrate more on my studies than my expenses.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":455.42,"image":{"id":1338512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She began her business because she wanted to stop sitting at home as a housewife and to generate income to support herself. She works at the business from 7:00 AM until 5:00 PM, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price increases and poor seasonal sales.\r\n\r\nSinnah requires a loan in order to buy foodstuffs such as palm oil, ground nut, and cooking seasoning. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to renovate the roof of her house because the rainy season is very close. In the future, Sinnah plans to have a permanent business structure.

She is married and has two children, aged 18 and 22. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her and works as a sales assistant in her business. In 2005, Mariatu established her building materials business. She began her business because she wanted to assist her husband in their home affairs.

This is because they have completely repaid their sixth loan with Friendship Bridge, which was their first loan funded through Kiva. Because of their previous loans, several women have been able to grow their businesses, which has enabled them to progress toward their goals in life. The ladies live in Juchanep, Totonicpan, and have been longtime neighbors and friends. Their average age is 39 years, and the average number of children in each household is three.\r\n\r\nArcoiris Group is requesting a second loan funded by Kiva. The funds from this loan will be invested mainly in businesses related to textile production (including weaving, hand embroidery and making aprons), as well as in selling vegetables and produce.\r\n\r\nPaulina, a founding member of Arcoiris Group, is someone who has been described in previous reports. She is a 36-year-old woman who has only a second grade education. She has four children. Along with her family, Paulina works in the textile industry. She used her previous loan to buy yarn, in order to increase production. She was able to successfully pay off that loan and looks forward to the next one. Presently, Paulina\u2019s business is doing well, and she is happy to report that she still employs three members of her community. Because of her previous loan, she was able to take orders which proved profitable, especially before the Easter holiday.\r\n\r\nPaulina is currently applying for an additional loan, which she will invest in the purchase of various types of fine yarns for her textile business. In addition, she will use her loan for her second revenue stream. Specifically, Paulina raises and sells chickens and intends to use part of her new loan to buy new chicks that she will raise! \r\n\r\nPaulina and the Arcoiris Group trust bank are extremely thankful for these loans, which will help them maintain and increase each of their businesses. They look forward to the future, to providing a good education for their children and improving their lifestyle. As their name suggests, with the loans and education that they are receiving, they are creating the pot of gold under the

They look forward to their monthly meetings, where they share experiences and make payments. They also enjoy the educational topics provided by Friendship Bridge and receive valuable information about business management, budgets, expenses, and women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights. Most of the information is new to them, as their average educational level is the third grade.\r\n \r\nThe trust bank, Los Tzoc Group, wishes to express their gratitude for their previous loans and their anticipated additional loan. The combination of the loan funded by Kiva lenders, and the training and education from Friendship Bridge, helps them to look forward to a more profitable and secure future for themselves, their

In the photo, she appears standing up on the right side of the photo, smiling, and wearing a short-sleeved black top. At this bank, the members have various businesses such as selling kebabs, furniture, new and used clothing, undergarments, and pastries. \r\n\r\nMarcela works by selling pastries. She doesn't have an established location but she learned in order to move her son forward since it just the two of them and she needs income to give him a better lifestyle. She started by making pastries about three years ago and learned from reading recipes, cook books and cooking articles. The most difficult part is moving forward with little money, since she doesn't have enough money to set up a business with the equipment and bakery supplies that are necessary to work. This means that she doesn't have money to buy supplies or to eat. She is sure that with the money she will receive, she will do well because she will be able to buy chocolate cookies, molds, and the necessary supplies to sell pastries and chocolates to nearby businesses that have made orders. Her favorite parts of working with Fondo Esperanza are the monetary help they provide, the trust they have in the members, the help, and the unconditional support. She also likes that the communal bank encourages them to move forward in their businesses and with their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1340517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

She began her business approximately three years ago, selling costume jewelry for ladies, such as watches, makeup, necklaces, bracelets, and more, in addition to underwear. Thanks to the loans given to her by FAPE and Kiva, she has started a business selling clothes for the whole family and her earnings have increased. She is requesting a loan in order to invest the majority of it in clothing sales and the rest in selling costume jewelry. Her greatest dream, which she asks God to fulfill soon, is to be able to buy a piece of land so she can have her own house as she currently lives in the family home.

She was able to do this. She started preparing two years ago and opened her convenience store in her house. It has been a success. She tarted as a project, buying a little bread and coffee. People sought out other things and she would get them little by little until she had a store. This is her first business. Her sister helps her with it, sometimes tending the store when she goes out to do the buying. She only has the income from the store and from two rooms she rents out in her house. She is asking for the loan to buy a display case for her business. Sales have increased and she has to display the products. She will also buy rice, sugar, oil, corn and other products. Her next goals are to buy display cases and a freezer. Her future plans are to have a well stocked store with good edible products.

After creating a business plan and designing her first line of custom-designed hats, Tiffany\u2019s idea and love for fashion had turned into a business, \"Ellie Hayes\".\r\n\r\nAs the owner of a start-up business and an MBA student, Tiffany balances the demands of both without complaint. She views starting her own business as an opportunity to achieve her dreams and give back. A percentage of each cap sold is donated to Clinics of Hope, a World Help organization committed to building medical clinics within villages and providing access to life-saving medical care. By donating to Clinics of Hope, Tiffany\u2019s business will be helping villages in sub-Sahara Africa build a stronger tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWhat Tiffany loves about owning her own company is the satisfaction and joy that comes from seeing a customer find confidence and individuality while wearing her product. She hopes that through her product people will feel stylish while knowing their purchase helped to give back.\r\n\r\nWith your help, Tiffany can fund the manufacturing cost of the hats and build an

Her biggest challenge is \"not enough well developed markets locally\".\r\n\r\nAlice (pictured with her dairy cow though requesting a poultry loan) was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'It has grace period.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Important for our economy.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Alice replied 'Improve living standards.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Alice owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1339063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

He lives in the Tetritskaro district with his mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Ilia requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have pigs and sell piglets locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nIlia requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Ilia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high risk borrowers because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Ilia will open a bakery. He will purchase a kneader for dough and all the needed equipment for starting bakery. This will increase the income of the family. Part of the income will be reinvested in the same business, and with another part he will provide better living conditions for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1339099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start a bakery and purchase a kneader for dough.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tetritskaro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-28T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-28T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ilia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":89.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":93.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":97.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.3},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":62.87,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":65.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749628},{"amount":46.3,"local_amount":74.07,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":76.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613535},{"amount":47.09,"local_amount":75.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":78.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857250},{"amount":48.48,"local_amount":77.56,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":80.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133903},{"amount":50.3,"local_amount":80.49,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107490},{"amount":51.36,"local_amount":82.17,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":85.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255038},{"amount":342.18,"local_amount":547.49,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":567.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019188}],"funded_date":"2013-04-28T17:07:20Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":552728,"name":"Juanito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanito is 40 years old.

Irma has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests have been rejected each  time, due to low family income and their poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the small amount earned by Irma\u2019s husband who works locally as an artisan. He earns a total of 250 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program aims to provide business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to poor rural people who do not have access to credit products. These poor rural people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Irma will begin trading in clothing. She plans to purchase clothing at wholesale prices and then resell at higher prices. This will increase her family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve her family's living conditions.

They have four children together, and most of them are grown up and independent. Augustina has worked as a seller for 9 years. She has a food stall and also gives massages at her hairdressing salon. She is originally from Carayao and moved to Coronel Oviedo 30 years ago to look for work opportunities. She says that it was difficult at first but little by little she got used to it with the help and support of her husband. She worked for other people for many years and then decided to start her own food stall which has gone very well for her because she is a friendly person. Later she learned to be a hairdresser and to give massages, and that worked out for her too.

Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land.\r\n\r\nHe has been transporting goods between provinces for two years. Last year he built a house on his land but couldn't move into the new house because of its vulnerable walls and floor. However, due to climate change, the Mongolian winter period is extended and he fears his family will be chilled down to their cores as next winter comes.\r\n\r\nSo, he is requesting a loan of 6,800,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, he can repair and make insulation for his house, thus providing more comfortable and warmer accommodation for his family members because a good quality house is advantageous in many ways compared to a Mongolian traditional ger which is mainly made of felts. More importantly, the renovated house will contribute to the efforts against air pollution because the family will burn less coal thus releasing less smoke into the atmosphere. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":1339196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He is single, and lives in the town of Ica, in the district of Parcona, with his parents and siblings. He is a very nice, hard-working, and enthusiastic person, who always wants to do his best. Unfortunately, due to his economic situation and the need to start working at a very young age to help his parents, Cesar was unable to study business administration, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to watch movies, and sometimes cooks a delicious chicken-and-rice dish called 'arroz con pollo', which he shares with his family. On his own initiative, sparing no efforts, and with admirable dedication, Cesar works as a labourer on a farm belonging to an agricultural union in his town. He works every day for about ten hours and attributes his success to his efforts and his amiability towards other people. Cesar is very grateful to Kiva lenders, since, thanks to their help, he will be able to buy an oven to replace the kerosene-powered stove he is currently using, which is flawed and hazardous. Thus, Cesar and his family will be able to cook in a more safe and secure manner. He wants to keep working towards his great dream of learning a profession and improving both his lot in life and his family's
