With this project, she hopes to grow and reach her goals, so that her family may enjoy a better standard of living and more economic stability. This is her first loan with the field partner.

Her market share is made up of business employees, people in the neighborhood, relatives, and referrals from her clients.

Bilkisu requires a loan in order to buy jeans, travelling boxes, Bamakoh clothing, and sets of pans and dishes.

When he and Elis started their own family, a store was a logical business outlet for both of their talents and abilities. The general store is open to the public from 5:45 each morning until 9:30 every night. Products are bought in cash, and Elis buys merchandise to stock the store from wholesale distributors to generate better profit margins. The majority of the clients at the general store are neighbors and people passing through the area in need of food items and other products for daily use.\r\n\r\nThis is Elis' first loan with Kiva, and she plans to use the support to purchase merchandise to stock her store, especially products with better shelf lives, which will help her keep her inventory and sales up.

","en":"Gavhar is 40 years old. She is married and raising two children. Since her youth, Gavhar has milked cows and helped her mother raise bulls. After she got married, she did not have opportunity to work with livestock breeding, as she lived in an apartment together with her husband. She always dreamed of living in a distant region, working with livestock breeding, and milk cows every day. She would like her children to drink fresh milk every morning. \r\n\r\nFinally they purchased a plot of land and built a house. Currently Gavhar has one cow. She would like to purchase an additional cow and sell milk to the neighbors. She requests a loan in the amount of 2,500 somoni for the purchase of a cow. She awaits your kindness. \r\n\r\nThis loan helps her develop her business and increase the income. As a conscientious woman, she promises to repay her loan on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1338417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She works at the business 12 hours per day, seven days per week. Fatmata says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan to buy more milk, gari, sugar, cigarettes and palm oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to give her children a quality education. In the future, she plans to expand her business to a shop level.

She has been running this business since 2009. She works at the business starting at 4:30 in the morning.  She will not rest until the food is finished and goes to the market for the next day.  She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and a proper business location for her cookery shop.\r\n\r\nMariama has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items such as rice, fish, palm oil and drinks. The extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her children's school fees and improve her level of living. In the future, she plans to expand her business to a restaurant level. She appreciates your support.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1339540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Varditer has a higher education; she is qualified to be a marketing manager. Before her marriage, Varditer worked as a marketing manager, and at the same time she engaged in confectionery production at her parents' house. Varditer likes the latter occupation and does it with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nShe married recently, and soon she will become a mother. Varditer continues to produce eastern confections, Armenian traditional sweets, and candies. She sells them to grocery markets in Yerevan. She has a lot of customers, and they prefer to buy candies and sweets from Varditer because her products have specific flavors and aromas, and they're made following old Armenian and eastern recipes. During maternity leave, Varditer decided to continue her candy production. She hopes to help her husband to meet their newly-created family's needs, and to save some money for her newborn child. Consequently, Varditer needs a loan, which she will use to buy a new oven and to buy walnuts, flour and sugar supplies, for her confectionery production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1339732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

After 15 years hard work Vladimir built his own grocery shop in Ijevan, and he organizes his trading there. In his shop Vladimir sells meat products, oil, dairy products, bread, sweets, candies and household products, which he buys from wholesale markets in Yerevan. Vladimir\u2019s wife works as a teacher in school, but from time to time helps him with the store. \r\n\r\nWith the profit from trading, Vladimir is able to care for his family and has finally been able get rid of the family's refugee status.

Only two of her children are going to school because of the financial constraints; she can\u2019t afford the educational expenses of all. Her husband is a wood cutter by profession and he has a very low monthly income.\r\n\r\nNighat is a very responsible and skilled woman. She is using her tailoring skills to generate an alternative source of income for her family. She is very experienced in stitching clothes and dresses. She has been doing this work from 5 years. Her clients are very satisfied with her work. \r\n\r\nNighat has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to expand her business. She wants to open a tailoring center and needs to purchase two new sewing machines. She would reinvest the profit amount on her business and a part of it to pay the educational expenses. She desires to send all of her children to schools. She is very hopeful that the loan will be a progressive step for her family.

In 2007, Kadiatu established her business of selling sets of pans, dishes, bowls, spoons, flasks, glasses, plates, cups, knives and pots, etc. She began her business because she dropped out of school because her parents did not value girls' education. She was used instead to assist her mother in business.  \r\n\r\nWhen Kadiatu got married, her husband gave her initial capital to start a business. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about Le1,568,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. Kadiatu requires a loan in order to buy sets of pans, dishes, bowls, flasks, glasses, plates and cups. In the future, Kadiatu plans to acquire a bigger shop, educate her children and build a house.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will help to increase her stock and generate more profit.

","en":"Ilhomjon is 36 years old, married and is raising 1 child.  He is a very caring husband and father.  His wife is a teacher at a high school.  Their daughter is 11 years old and she studies in school.  Ilhomjon has run his own business for more than 6 years--he's a butcher.

She is using her tailoring skills to generate an alternative source of income for her family. She is very experienced in stitching clothes and dresses. She has been doing this work for six years. Her clients are very happy and well satisfied with her work. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to expand her business. She wants to open a tailoring center in her house. She would purchase two new sewing machines so that her production would be increased. She would also purchase some thread and cloth for the purpose of stitching. She would pay for the educational expenses of her children with the profit. She is very hopeful that the loan will be a progressive one for her family.

She has been planning weddings and parties for her close friends, family and clients in the Tuscaloosa area for many years.\r\n\r\nSylvia understands the \u201cins-and-outs\u201d of party planning. She has been in the business for more than ten years \u2013 building a strong clientele while also successfully managing her marriage of twenty-eight years and raising her teenage daughter. She has many repeat clients who request her expertise \u2013 so many, in fact, that she knew she would have to obtain working capital to keep up with the demand.  \r\n\r\nThree years ago, she realized that she needed to own her own equipment and stop the cycle of renting equipment and losing money each time she planned an event. That is when she created All for U.  \r\n\r\nThe funds from Accion Texas Inc. allowed Sylvia to purchase her own tables, fabrics, a collapsible room divider and other event equipment to plan that special day for someone. She was also able to keep her two part-time employees and give them an increase in pay for their dedication and hard work. She believes her dedicated employees have been with her for many years because she is able to pay them well and treat them with respect.  \r\n\r\nThese funds allowed All for U to bring in positive cash flow and continue securing events for the future. Without the help from Accion Texas Inc., Sylvia would not have been able to accomplish all of this so quickly.\r\n\r\nSylvia hopes one day to own her own land and facility as revenues increase. For now, she is focusing on learning new ways to be creative with event planning and securing future events to grow her business.

Elvia is a member of the group. She says that she is 32 years old, and has been married to Lorenzo for 12 years. Together they have made a family of two children, one of whom is in school. Elvia says that she has had a convenience store for a year and a half. With her husband, Lorenzo, she decided to open the store because it would be a big help in paying the household expenses.\r\n\r\nElvia says that when they started their business, they didn't have any furniture and only had merchandise. Over time, they were able to make the furniture. She says that one of the biggest difficulties they have is the lack of a bigger counter where she could put her merchandise give her customers better service. Elvia remarks: \"when we started, I was worried about the competition because there were already a lot of stores. I even came to think that we would lose our investment. Fortunately, that didn't happen and it has gone very well for us and it has been a year and a half already.\" \r\n\r\nElvia is very happy with her business and she dreams of one day having a well equipped store that is well stocked so she can make more profit and get her children ahead. She wants them to keep going to school and have good careers in order to have a better quality of life. All of the members of the group are very happy and grateful to the institutions of Vision Fund and Kiva for all of their support and services.

From a young age she has always had financial difficulties, but even so she has always fought to get ahead in life.  Her mother always instilled in her a love for school and the desire to be successful, and she has taught her how important school is to being able to achieve a good future and a better quality of life.  She attended elementary school with many sacrifices because they had to pay a tuition, and then when she went to high school she had to care for her younger siblings on the weekends so her mom could work.  \r\n\r\nWhen she was young she had a bitter experience with some relatives. When she finished elementary school they offered to help her with high school and college.  In view of this good opportunity, when she was only 10 years old, she accepted what she thought was an excellent opportunity, but with time and after many humiliations and bad treatment, and although she graduated from high school, she understood that it had been a mistake and later decided to go back to her parents and her siblings because she was no longer willing to endure more abuse.\r\n\r\nLater she tried to find opportunities to study, but it seemed that every time she tried to search something intervened; it was almost impossible.  If the majority of times it was not for money that she did not have for the application form or things like that, then it was for some other requirement; at times they gave her options for credits or loans but she did not have someone to serve as a guarantor.\r\n\r\nNow she is a single mother of two beautiful girls, and she tries to fight to offer them a better future since she dreams of giving them a good education and a good opportunity to take them to college because, although they are young now, one wants to be a doctor and the other an anthropologist. \r\n\r\nAt this time she is attending the second semester of financial accounting and it has been difficult; she is not sure whether for lack of studying or lack of experience.  In addition, she has not been able to find stable employment.  Therefore she has had to take whatever work comes along, as the expression goes; she has been working as a domestic employee, an assistant in the kitchen, and an assistant along the school route.  She is always trying to fulfill her obligations and the expenses of her daughters (the rent, monthly payment for kindergarten, food, clothing, shoes, utilities, health, and semester fees)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1340347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To finish her studies in financial accounting.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-28T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-28T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enyi Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":390000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":138001.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891055},{"amount":5.77,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10615.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391557682},{"amount":80.77,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":148617.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780610},{"amount":63.46,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":116770.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845842}],"funded_date":"2013-04-28T19:48:06Z","paid_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":553232,"name":"Edna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edna is married and works hard to support her family.

que para llegar al lugar es caminando ya que no hay trasporte para llegar es un muy grande la comunidad donde la gente se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz. El nombre lo eligieron porque el lugar donde se re\u00fanen hay muchos capulines son un grupo peque\u00f1o pero que la gente aprovecha para hacer grandes cosas como atole de capul\u00edn, tamal de capul\u00edn etc. El grupo \"Capulines\" esta conformado por cinco mujeres y un hombre son personas muy responsables pero sobretodo muy trabajadores los integrantes estan solicitando un credito a la institucion para invertirle a sus actividades economicas como Sabina comprara alimento para sus cerdos que necesita para engordar sus animales, Esperanza comprara borregos chicos para cria y engorda, Teresa comprara materiales para su ciber cafe, Raul ocupara su credito para abastecer su tienda de abarrotes y Viviana invertira en sus productos de bisuteria. Do\u00f1a Apolonia quien tambien forma parte del grupo platica que tiene 58 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer viuda toda su vida ha vivido en la comunidad. Do\u00f1a Apolonia platica qe con su credito quiere retomar su tienda de abarrotes anteriormente ya tenia una dicha actividad economica la aprendio porque sus padres se dedicaban a la venta de abarrotes. Tiene un hijo en E.U el cual le envio un poco de dinero para iniciar con la tienda de abarrotes pero no le alcanza es por eso que esta solicitando el credito para comprar, azucar, sal, refrescos, huevo, leche, detergentes, productos enlatados. Etc. La se\u00f1ora Apolonia argumenta \"Tuve que cerrar el negocio porque en ese tiempo todas mis hijas estudiaban y no nos alcanzaba para seguir invirtiendole a la tienda de abarrotes\" Pero Do\u00f1a Apolonia esta muy contenta porque gracias al prestamo de Vision Fund y KIVA podra tener nuevamente su tienda de abarrotes.El sue\u00f1o de Do\u00f1a Apolonia es volver a tener su tiendita de abarrotes como lo tenia anteriormente y no tener preocupaciones economicas mas adelante.","en":"The group \u201cCapulines\u201d is located in a remote area and you must go on foot as there is no transportation. It is a large community where the people grow corn. They chose their name because the place where they meet has many  capulines (a type of cherry). They are a small group but the people take advantage to do big things such as making capuline atole (a corn-based drink) and capuline tamales. The group Capulines is made up of five women and one man. They are very responsible and above all very hardworking. \r\n\r\nThe members are seeking a loan from the institution in order to invest it in their economic activities such as Sabina who will buy food for her pigs for breeding and fattening the animals. Esperanza will buy sheep for breeding and fattening. Teresa will buy supplies for her cybercafe. Raul will use his loan to supply his grocery store. Viviana will invest in costume jewelry.\r\n\r\nApolonia who is also a part of the mentioned group is 58 years old. She is a  widow who has lived all her life in the community. Apolonia says that she wants to reopen her grocery store as she learned this financial activity from her parents who were engaged in selling groceries. She has a son in the United States who sent her a little money to open her grocery store but not enough and that is why she is asking for a loan in order to buy sugar, salt, soft drinks, eggs, milk, detergents, canned food, etc. Apolonia reasons that, \u201cI had to close the business because at that time all my daughters studied and I could not come up with enough to keep investing in the grocery store.\u201d But Apolonia is very happy because thanks to the loan from Vision Fund and Kiva she can once again have her grocery store. Apolonia\u2019s dream is that her small store is like it used to be before and that she does not have future financial concerns.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1338842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy sugar, salt, eggs, soft drinks, bread, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Valerio, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-04-28T19:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-28T19:40:09Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apolonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":456.25,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5547.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048992},{"amount":456.25,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5547.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840161},{"amount":456.25,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5547.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698500},{"amount":456.25,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5547.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698501}],"funded_date":"2013-04-29T05:42:19Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T14:24:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":553233,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn is 37 years old.

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his wife and son in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He has been raising seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last 10 years. He chose this business because it is profitable and because there is always a high demand for fresh crops. People use fresh vegetables every day and include them in many national dishes, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every family table in Azerbaijan and are often made into fresh punch.  \r\n\r\nRashid sells his crops in the BIlasuvar central bazaar. His monthly income is 100 AZN. His wife actively helps him to raise his crops.

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) who lives with his wife and five children in Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He breeds cows and cattle and earns an income by selling milk and milk products, as well as selling cattle for meat purposes to local butchers. Rashid has more than 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father, who expertly taught him how to look after cattle.\r\n\r\nHusan usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, and resells them at a more profitable price at the local livestock bazaar. He also sells milk and yogurt to his neighbors. Milk and meat sales bring him an income of 100 AZN per month. Milk, yogurt, and meat are all very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in such everyday national dishes as pilau and dolma, and most people usually serve yogurt sauce with their meals. Milk products are considered very healthy and are consumed daily.\r\n\r\nThis is the only source of financial income for the family, and Husan reports that it is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children. He has therefore applied for a loan in the amount of 2,000 AZN in order to purchase two milk cows, two cattle, and cattle fodder. He has already completed several loans with AqroInvest and has a good client

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) living with his wife and son in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. Habil breeds cows and cattle, and he sells milk and milk products as well as selling cattle for meat purposes to local butchers. He also raises sheep for meat purposes. Habil has five years of experience in this field, thanks to his father who expertly taught him how to look after cattle. \r\n\r\nHabil usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, and resells them at a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar. He also sells milk and yogurt to his neighbors. Milk and meat sales bring him 100 AZN income per month. Milk and yogurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in such everyday national dishes as pilau and dolma and always accompany these with yogurt sauce. Milk products are considered very healthy and are consumed daily.   \r\n\r\nThis is the only source of financial income for the family, and Habil reports that it is not enough to cover the basic needs of his famaily. Habil has therefore applied for a loan in the amount of 2,000 AZN in order to purchase two cattle, two milk cows, and cattle fodder. This will be his second loan and he has a good client history.

Since then, to manage her family she started a grocery store at her home where 100 families depend on her grocery store. In this way, she is earning 3,500 INR per month.

They named their group \"El Fresno de la Soledad\" [\"The Ash of Solitude\"] because where they were meeting, there was a big ash tree, and to locate the group quickly, they gave it that name. She says that she is sad right now because her father-in-law is very ill. He was a member of the group and a very hardworking gentleman; now his health is very delicate, so she is taking care of him. \r\n\r\nFrancisca earns her living growing avocados. Where she lives, she has a big field where she grows corn, marigolds, peaches, a stubble crop, etc. She says that she has the field divided in half; in one half she has the avocado orchard, and in the other half, she grows the other crops. She is requesting a loan because she wants to buy fertilizers and insecticides to strengthen her avocado trees; she has small fruit right now, and to keep them from falling off, she needs to apply these materials. She says that she has 180 trees and she and her husband take care fo them because they hope to one day leave them to their children as an inheritance.\r\n\r\nShe says that Vision Fund has made several loans to her and that she has paid all of them back well, and that thanks to those loans, she has been able to make her farm grow.

To prepare palm oil locally, she washes the palm fruit and boils it until it becomes soft and tender. She scoops the cooked fruit into a big mortar and gently pounds it with a pestle to avoid damaging the nut. She then scoops the pounded fruit into a bowl. Water is then added to the pounded fruit. The mixture of water and the pounded fruit is squeezed and filtered to get the juice out and the chaff removed. The chaff is sometimes used by the local people to light charcoal fires. The juice is boiled again and as it boils, the fresh oil will float to the surface of the pot. The oil is fetched from the surface, put into another pot, and left to cool.

Last year, he began building a house on his land because living in a ger during the winter time is very hard. But due to a lack of finances, he has only built the house's foundation and now lots of work remains undone. So he is requesting a loan of 6,600,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, cement, and gypsum. Using these materials, he can complete the house-building work and provide his family members with comfortable and warm accommodations. When his family moves into the house, they will reduce their coal usage for heating and it will contribute to the efforts against air pollution by releasing less carbon dioxide.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMerab requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Merab will open a car wash. He will purchase all the needed equipment for it and will work hard to increase the income of the family. Merab hopes that the car wash will be profitable and he will do his best to satisfy his clients. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 16,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nLynette dreams of expanding her junk shop and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

They live in Talibon, Bohol. Cherry Gil runs a sari-sari or variety store business, selling various goods and items to the people in her place. \r\n\r\nCherry Gil wants to expand her business, but lacks the capital to do so. For this reason, she joined CEVI to gain access to the loan services offered by the organization to the micro entrepreneurs like her.

is 49 years old. She lives in a small village of the Lagodekhi District with her husband and two daughters. Ahida requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from their sheep-breeding business. They have 40 sheep and sell lambs locally. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nAhida requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Ahida has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.
