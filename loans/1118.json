Additional income for the family comes from Lela\u2019s mother in-law\u2019s monthly pension. \r\nLela requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Lela has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit Lela will start trading with fruits and vegetables. She will purchase a car and agricultural products from the reseller in Gurjaani district, bring the products to the capital city of Georgia, Tbilisi, and sell at the local market.  Part of the profit Lela will use for reinvesting in the same business and develop her trading. Another part she will use for the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She has received schooling through basic level to middle school level. Mercy is a petty trader as well as a food vendor who prepares and sells banku at Akpafu, Hohoe.

She mixes the cassava and corn dough and cooks them into a porridge-like consistency form. To get the right consistency, she has to stir the mixture on a hot firewood stove. The texture of banku has to be fine, but firm. The accompanying dish can either be any kind of soup or sauce such as palm nut soup, groundnut soup or peanut soup, okra soup, or hot pepper sauce with fish of any kind.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a farmer. Mercy uses her income to help her husband with the general upkeep of the home, as well as to support extended family members. Mercy will use the loan to purchase bags of cassava dough, palm fruits, a bag of rice, a gallon of oil, and a bag of onions. With the new profits from her expanded business, Mercy plans to save and increase her working capital so she can operate a bigger chop bar in the near future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1340425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

36-year-old Isatu from Port Loko northern area in Sierra Leone. She is married with four children between the ages of five and 11. Her children are currently attending school. In 2006, Isatu established her general store business. She began her business because she was trained in business and she thinks it is profitable. She works at the business 12 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the price inflation of goods.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to purchase more soap, rice, sugar, and drinks. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her standard of living and pay her children\u2019s school fees. In the future, Isatu plans to buy a plot of land. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1340480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She cooks and sells banku and fufu, local Ghanaian dishes. In Ghana, fufu is mostly made from boiled cassava and unripe plantain beaten together. Fufu (also known as foofoo or foufou) is a thick paste usually made by boiling starchy root vegetables in water and pounding with a mortar and pestle until the desired consistency is reached. The malleable dough is served and eaten with a light tomato soup, groundnut soup, palm oil fruit soup or other soups. Banku\/Akple is fermented corn\/cassava dough mixed proportionally and cooked in hot water into a smooth whitish consistent paste. Served with soup, stew or a pepper sauce with fish. The most popular side dish for banku in Ghana is okra stew.  \r\n\r\nVivian is single but has 3 children. She has been in business for the past 9 years.

Since she did not go to school, she began her business to have a permanent source of income to support her family. Neneh works every day from morning to night. She says that her business is doing well and she has daily sales above 200,000 SLL each day.   \r\n\r\nNeneh is requesting a loan to buy a variety of slippers. The extra income from her loan will allow her to repay her loan installments and buy a generator to improve her house. In the future, Neneh plans to build a permanent residence. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1340465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

is a married man aged 37 years. He has six children aged 18, 16, 10, 9, 7 and 4 years, and out of these children only three attend school. Vincent operates a business dealing in the sale of a local brew commonly known as waragi, and it is his major source of income to look after the family.

She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nMariatu requires a loan in order to buy more body cream, soap and assorted drinks.

In his free time, Manuel likes to sightsee, visit family, and participate in the community's festivals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1342445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Chillanes","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":159,"posted_date":"2013-04-29T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-29T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":478.74,"local_amount":478.74,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-28T08:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":478.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479122686},{"amount":121.26,"local_amount":121.26,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-23T08:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":121.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490816779}],"funded_date":"2013-05-04T06:13:01Z","paid_date":"2014-06-23T08:47:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":553764,"name":"Erwin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erwin, 35 years old, is married to a government employee and they are blessed with two children.

According to Credo\u2019s evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Albert applied for a loan from Credo for a start-up family business.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Albert and his wife will begin trading in fruits and vegetables.

Together, they have two children, with whom they live in their own house. \r\n\r\nAurelia's work consists of selling juice, and she also has a welding workshop. She has a stall in the main market of her town, where she works every day from the early morning preparing various types of breakfast food. She has been in this business for six years, and her oldest daughter helps her with the work. She shares her time between this activity and another business, the welding workshop. She opened the workshop six months ago, and she occasionally works there in the afternoons. It is mainly her husband who works there. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that it allows her to be in contact with people constantly. She enjoys learning about her clients' preferences and what they order so that she can continue to improve. Aside from this, she enjoys the profit from her two business activities. \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with Kiva.

Dagoberto has been a farmer for 15 years. His main crops are corn and sorghum. When his harvest is ready, he stores it in the granary shown in the photograph to then sell to people who sell staple grains in the markets close to his place of residence.

Specifically, they have a milking cow whose milk is used in cheese production. In addition, they have a vineyard with 200 grape vines and agricultural land where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested products and cheese at local markets. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. George has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, George will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built, he will be able to sow cucumbers, tomatoes, and greens. George will sell the harvested products locally at a good price, increasing the family income.

Nyaziwe has requested a loan of $150 to buy clothes and jackets for sale. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will go towards the upkeep of her family. In the future, Nyaziwe plans to open a boutique in town.\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1340890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy jackets and other clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Masvingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":184,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nyaziwe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunungurai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":102.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":109.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":113.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":116.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.44,"local_amount":100.44,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372978744},{"amount":102.99,"local_amount":102.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":102.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381759051},{"amount":106.76,"local_amount":106.76,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":106.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390622946},{"amount":109.7,"local_amount":109.7,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":109.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399867132},{"amount":113.21,"local_amount":113.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":113.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410355710},{"amount":116.9,"local_amount":116.9,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":116.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420274971}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T11:46:17Z","paid_date":"2013-11-19T10:12:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":554161,"name":"Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandrina naci\u00f3 en la comunidad de Cota\u00f1i y vive en la misma comunidad donde naci\u00f3.

They are located in the main municipality which is known for its traditional celebrations.  The members of the group say that they used to work with another micro-finance group named \"La Conchita\", but they had many internal problems so decided to change.  They met Vision Fund and, for them, it is a new way of working.  Since they were beginning again, they took the name \"La Nueva Esperanza\" (New Hope).  Mary, 48, is the representative of the group.  She is married to Manuel and they have four dependent children. \r\n\r\nMary has been in the business of selling tacos since she was 16.  She says she began the business because a relative of her husband's had a restaurant-bar but after a while decided to close it.  Mary's husband opened the business again to sell tacos.  On this occasion, Mary is requesting a loan to buy soft drinks, gas, benches and chairs for her business.  She enjoys her work and through much effort and hard work has been able to open four street vending locations.  However, these are not her own places, but on loan, and Mary lives with the anguish that one day she will be ousted.  Mary says \"I only dream about having my own business in my house so we do not have to suffer like this\".  \r\n\r\nLike Mary, the other members of the group also have their dreams and goals with their families, but what they want the most is to improve their lifestyles.  The members of the group are Teodora and Cristina, who run taco stands, J Carmen who has a tire business, Juan Luis who has an Internet Caf\u00e9, Jose Juan and Francisco who will buy corn for tortillas, Isabel who will buy bedspreads and sheets, Pasucala who will buy costume jewelry, Imelda who will buy shoes, Arnulfo who will invest in his pastry business, Elena who will buy groceries for her store and Jacqueline, who will invest in her stationery store.  All of the members are very happy and grateful to Vision Fund and KIVA for this loan which will be helpful to their businesses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7425,"image":{"id":1338819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She lives with her family in a small village. Since she was a little girl, she dreamed of becoming a school teacher. But right after graduating from school, her parents married her off, and she had to forget about her dreams and devote her time to being a housewife. Soon there were children, and with them, lots of worry. In order to have some type of income, she began to raise livestock. She bought a pair of cows and she began to tend to them and fatten them. She sold the milk in her village. Her children helped her to deliver the milk and various dairy products. Now Djamilia has been operating this business of raising and fattening animals for 15 years. Her husband drives a taxi and sends her money each month, but it's only enough for them to buy food. Djamilia wants to expand her business by buying another cow to get more income, improve her family's economic standing, and to save money to send her children to college. So Djamilia has turned to Arvand for a loan to buy a cow to expand her business. She is counting heavily their assistance, and thanks Arvand in adavnce."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1338221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1573.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1626.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":331.87,"local_amount":1573.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616104},{"amount":343.13,"local_amount":1626.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1633.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859973}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T13:50:56Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peter and Lynne Weil","image":null}},{"id":554047,"name":"Jemah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jemah lives in West Point, one of the most populated and well known markets in Montserrado county.

She has been selling through NOVICA since 2006. She would like to invest in more sterling silver to create new jewelry designs.\r\n\r\n This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I come from Celuk, famous for its gold and silversmiths, so I learned to design and craft jewelry from a very young age. In 2003, I married an artist from Gianyar and went to live with his family, like Balinese tradition dictates. However, I obsessed with crafting jewelry and fortunately, my husband understood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so grateful for the chance to get a micro-credit loan. This will help me to create more stock and also to prepare new designs. I am so thankful for all your support, and hopefully, you would like to collect the jewelry I make. It would also be wonderful if you'd recommend my jewelry to your friends and families. It will mean so much when my designs are known and worn by lovely people everywhere in the world.

and culture of the South Texas city. While working as a webmaster for four years, Michael learned about the powerful impact that online technology and social media have in bringing people together.  His technical experience in graphic and web design, coupled with his love for entertainment, led him to create entForm.com, an online entertainment news portal and e-commerce marketplace.\r\n\r\nRather than compete against or replicate existing local entertainment websites, entForm collaborates with other websites to feature their articles and events on one central website for the convenience of San Antonio residents and visitors alike. After extensively researching the strengths and weaknesses of similar websites, Michael determined that the best way to differentiate entForm was to actively engage its users. In addition to searching articles and events, users will be able to submit their own articles, music and photographs, as well as comment and share information with their social network friends.\r\n\r\nThe one-stop-shop website will also have an e-commerce component. Users will be able to sell and purchase a variety of items through the site\u2019s online marketplace in a secure and appealing manner. Advertising opportunities will be available to local businesses looking to reach new audiences and grow their own sales.\r\n\r\nMichael is excited to launch his new business venture. To augment what he has learned in his four years as a webmaster, Michael has sought opportunities to learn more about managing and operating an online business.

So by the time the 32-year-old started his own business, Superior Refrigeration A\/C Service & Supply, Juan had more than a decade of experience. \r\n\r\n\u201cIt all started with an idea in high school,\u201d Juan said. \r\n\r\nFrom helping his father with his AC business, Juan knew that people in South Texas desperately need their air conditioning to function during the summer. Understanding the simple economics of supply and demand, he knew his experience would go a very long way. Juan said his father taught him to do a good job, shake someone\u2019s hand, and complete a job. Since opening his own business 2 \u00bd years ago, Juan said he has seen a dramatic demand for his services. \r\n\r\nJuan turned to a banker at Capital One, who then referred him to Accion Texas. Juan used his Accion Texas loan to purchase a special service van to carry equipment and also for working capital. With the extra working capital, he is able to purchase the parts he needs to repair air conditioning units in advance.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Juan employees subcontractors for large projects and is also subcontracted by his father\u2019s business when his father needs help. Juan describes his business as a very fast moving and dynamic industry where technology and skill are always in demand. In the future, Juan plans to hire employees to continually grow his business. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1341401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Air Conditioning","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a special service van to carry equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Brownsville, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T13:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T13:20:04Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":153.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":147.11},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":149.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":151.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":153.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":158.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":163.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":165.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":168.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":173.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":175.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":178.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":181.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":183.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":186.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":189.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":192.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":195.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":198.14},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":201.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":204.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":207.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":210.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":213.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":219.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":223.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.14},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":554150,"name":"Cupertina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Since opening her small restaurant, Topis, more than 12 years ago, Cupertina has been serving delicious traditional Mexican food to new and loyal clients that visit her establishment in Atascosa, Texas.\r\n\r\nCupertina is a hardworking mother, and soon to be grandmother, who has goals to expand the family restaurant.

running his own business renting scuba and surf gear in the sunny coastal city of San Diego. Most likely destined to be doing hard labor for an oil company back in Louisiana, Justin drove out to California to visit a family friend and drastically changed the course of his future.\r\n \r\nIn what he calls a \u201cfall off the turnip truck\u201d moment, he arrived at the beach and immediately felt a connection. Embraced by the warm climate and laid-back culture, Justin knew he had arrived at his new home. Even though he had been a country boy all his life, Justin\u2019s ambition led him to get his scuba certification. Seeing the potential to quickly generate a return on his investment, he went through the process of becoming a certified scuba instructor and started working for different shops around town. \r\n\r\nHe eventually started his own company, Pacific Beach Sports, renting water sports equipment such as scuba gear and paddleboards. He moved into a storefront in the heart of San Diego\u2019s famous Pacific Beach, filled the racks with equipment to rent or buy, and made connections with other instructors to lead certification classes in the space. \r\n \r\nNow almost two years in, he has seen significant growth but is ready to take his business to the next level. Justin\u2019s $7,000 Kiva loan will enable him to purchase additional inventory and better market his business to grow its visibility in the community.  \r\n\r\nJustin hopes to eventually grow Pacific Beach Sports into San Diego\u2019s premiere water sports rental and sales company, helping others experience the natural beauty and excitement of the city that he fell in love with so many years ago.\r\n\r\nFor more information or to rent gear on your next trip to San Diego, check out his website: http:\/\/www.pacbeachsports.com\/

they were growing up.  However, when the economy slowed down in 2001, Marisela knew that she would need to start working to help supplement her husband\u2019s income.  \r\n\r\nShe initially had difficulty finding work that would be flexible enough to allow her to raise her own children until she joined the Chicano Federation Child Care Training Program and became licensed to run a daycare program out of her home.  Running a daycare allowed Marisela to stay home with her children, while enabling her to support her family.\r\n\r\nMarisela knows that taking care of children is not just about making sure nothing happens to them, but also about providing an enriching environment for them to play and thrive. She will use her $2,000 Kiva loan to make upgrades to her house and purchase additional toys and furniture for the kids under her care.

When asked how he will use this loan to benefit his family, Richard replied, \"I will use it to generate income for my children.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Richard owns a cow and poultry but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in his household a mosquito net and running water but does not have electricity, solar power, sewing machine, TV or DVD player.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi

her main reason for living. She is a very friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic person who dedicates all of her efforts towards providing for her daughter, since she is both mother and father to her. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to a lack of resources and the need to begin working at a young age, Magdalena was not able to study a professional career in nursing as she would have liked. In her free time, she likes to play with her daughter and sometimes she cooks a delicious Carapulcra con Sopa Seca (a traditional Peruvian stew) to share with her family.\r\n\r\nBy her own initiative and with plenty of effort and dedication, Magdalena works in her small business selling lenses, frames, and sunglasses.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, raising poultry for eggs and meat is a very profitable business.  Kiva loans are used to purchase chicks, food, and necessary medicine to keep the chickens healthy.  Once mature, the chickens are sold at small butcher shops or in the many open air markets throughout the valley.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1341624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicks to raise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-29T09:10:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020263},{"amount":29,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.16,"payment_id":381808092},{"amount":28.31,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.86,"payment_id":390668155},{"amount":54.93,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5054.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.4,"payment_id":400621671},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.23,"payment_id":410196554},{"amount":27.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.84,"payment_id":419960003},{"amount":27.95,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"payment_id":429613896},{"amount":28.24,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.93,"payment_id":439840358},{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.19,"payment_id":449730295},{"amount":28.1,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.07,"payment_id":459209676},{"amount":28.94,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-21T09:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.21,"payment_id":479252976}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T17:00:27Z","paid_date":"2014-05-21T09:32:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":554286,"name":"Ellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 48-year-old Ellen.
