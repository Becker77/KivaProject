Fsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kabati FSA (Financial and Savings Association) is a village bank dedicated to improving the lives of its community members.\n\nMost of the FSA\u2019s members live on less than $1 a day, have little collateral, and are therefore unable to access loans through traditional banking services. Its members are mainly farmers and those working in the informal sector, such as shopkeepers, market vendors, and tailors. Most of the FSA members live in a rural setting and cook using open fires and inefficient mud stoves. These produce health-damaging smoke and contribute to the deforestation that is destroying Kenya\u2019s environment. Paradigm\u2019s cookstoves will reduce the toxic smoke by 70% and will reduce the fuel needed to cook by up to 50%. \n\nKabati FSA was started in 2004 and has around 4,000 members, 70% of whom are women. The FSA mainly disburses business loans at a very low interest rate. It has a repayment rate of close to 100%. The FSA is fully owned and governed by its members, all of whom have shares in the bank.\n\nKabati FSA introduced Paradigm\u2019s improved cookstoves to its members in August 2012. The stoves were received extremely well by its members. Most are extremely eager to purchase a cookstove. However, paying for the product upfront presents a challenge. It is difficult for the FSA to raise enough low-interest capital to finance the cookstoves for its members, as business loans make up the majority of the FSA\u2019s loan portfolio. With a loan from Kiva, Kabati FSA will be able to offer cookstoves to its members in four monthly installments. \n\nWith a Kiva loan, Kabati FSA will receive 290 fuel-efficient cookstoves from Paradigm and will offer its members manageable financing terms to purchase a stove. This will make the cookstoves accessible to even the lowest income members of the FSA.  \n\nHelp improve the health and financial stability of a rural family in Kenya today!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4500,"image":{"id":1336900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cookstove products for sale to end users","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":286,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":4500,"lender_count":137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kabati Fsa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4495,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":4500,"local_amount":4495,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381807989}],"funded_date":"2013-05-02T05:16:17Z","paid_date":"2013-08-06T09:18:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":554315,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 26-year-old, married guy, living in Gaza.

She also runs a tailoring shop within the local markets to supplement her income. \r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming \"keeping cows.\" Her biggest challenge is \"a lack of funds.\" Her animals are not named. She will use the loan to buy a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nSelly was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"because it provides good client training.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. She replied, \"Juhudi Kilimo is best.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expenses are her farming costs. When asked how will this loan benefit her family, Selly replied \"It will enable me to generate more income and meet my family's needs.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Selly owns a cow and a motorcycle but does not own a pig, poultry, pump, bicycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in her household a mosquito net and sewing machine but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, TV or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the fields and then send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1341534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She has 5 siblings and her parents are very loving. Her father is a farmer and her mother is a teacher. Carol enjoyed school and met a lot of special people there. She graduated from secondary school recently. Her parents have always wanted their daughter to get ahead, and it's for this reason that they sent her to the city to live with relatives, because in the place where she was born there aren't very many universities or options for work. \r\n\r\nIn the first semester she was trying to get into public universities but it wasn't possible. She couldn't study that semester because private universities are very expensive and her parents aren't able to pay for them. \r\n\r\nSomebody told Carol about the corporation for higher education, where she found a great opportunity for easily financing her studies. She signed up in the technical professional program for financial accounting and started in the second semester that same year. She did this with the help of her parents, who, with some difficulty, paid for her studies until she reached the age of majority. \r\n\r\nFrom there, Carol began to work and her parents supported her, since they recognized how difficult it would be for them to continue to pay for her studies. Through a friend, Carol began to work at a call center where she has been working for 8 months. She recognizes that it is very difficult but at times is is necessary to make sacrifices to get what you want. Thanks to her job, Carol can pay for her studies and personal expenses. She has very little free time, because she studies in the morning and works in the evening, but she enjoys it because she knows that some day her hard work will pay off. She considers herself an entrepreneurial person, so she has her future well thought out. She plans to become a professional in accounting and finance when she finishes her degree. \r\n\r\nCarol is currently in her 4th semester and feels very proud of herself. For this reason, she is very happy that there are organizations like Kiva that want to provide support and promote the development of higher education across the world, in particular in her country that has few opportunities but is full of many people like her who want to get ahead in life. She feels very grateful for Kiva's help and for the success that Kiva has in advancing projects that support young students."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1343100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finish her studies in financial accounting.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroll Vannesa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":260000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":137279.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891056},{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":137279.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912461}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T18:11:37Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aesclinn Donohue","image":1310197}},{"id":554320,"name":"Bahaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bahaa is 32 years old and lives at Tulkarem.

A nursing career also allows one to gain knowledge which the lender will use in the future to develop her profession with pride and responsibility.\r\nNursing is a way for her to grow as a person and to get ahead in life with a profession that helps her as well as the rest of people. It also brings added value to the society by providing immediate and opportune help for the community.\r\nAngie has made a lot of efforts to study but they are still not enough. The jobs she has held are temporary, for hours, months or days. She has worked as a babysitter, among other things. Her mum helps her whenever she can but she has to take care of the household chores. She also helps Angie with a little money when she can. Angie and her mother live alone since Angie's father left two years ago and he provides very little help. He is living elsewhere with Angie's grandparents and has to help them.\r\nAngie hopes to finish her studies without obstacles. While she continues to study she will do the internship and finally, with a little more experience, she hopes to find a job where she can continue to learn and that allows her to finish her nursing studies and keep learning.\r\nAngie also wants to help her mother with the household expenses, with the tranquility that her own expenses will not be high. She hopes to save enough money for the semester, because sometimes she struggles to save for the full fee due to additional expenses and, like she mentioned, she has only found short-term jobs, often with low pays. This is why Kiva's loan would be very helpful for her and for many other students that want to finish their studies, work and forward their careers. She hopes to get the loan for the above mentioned reasons.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1343204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finish her academic program","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angie Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":152532.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891058},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":305064.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912463}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T20:18:27Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Leticia Barbero","image":835885}},{"id":554707,"name":"Fidelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fidelina es una mujer joven, din\u00e1mica, con 30 a\u00f1os de edad casada que de su matrimonio tiene 3 hijos los cuales  dependen de ella en todos los aspectos.

Because of this, it\u2019s almost impossible for her husband to get good earnings from it. Shehnaz has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BRAC Pakistan, to raise the amount needed for repairing the engine of her husband's taxi, so that he can drive it properly. With the profit amount, her husband would buy one more taxi in future.\r\n\r\nShehnaz desires to provide quality education to her children, and she prays for the good health of her family and for the growth of her husband's business.

He lives in Gelati village, Tkibuli district, with his 33-year-old wife, his retired mother and his two-year-old son. Iuri requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 milk cows, 2 calves, a vineyard and plot of agricultural land.  The cows are milked every day to make dairy products. From the harvested grapes family makes wine and vodka. All the products are sold locally at the markets so the family gets a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nIuri requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Iuri has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Iuri will purchase chicks. He already has cages ready for them. After buying the chicks, Iuri will raise them and sell as chickens at a good price. This will bring him a good profit. Part of the profit will be  reinvested in the same business, in order to expand his poultry. Another part will be used for family well-being. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She is a real fighter. She completed her primary education. She has three children, two of whom are married adults who live in their own homes, and her youngest daughter, who is in secondary school and lives with her. She helps her mother with different household chores and tasks. She has a lot of experience growing vegetables (potatoes). She has been farming for a long time. Her parents taught her the trade when she was very young, so it has been her family's source of income for many years. Her crops are located 100 meters from her home, which allows her to see to them. Her only help is her daughter, and occasionally her older children, since they also make a living as farmers. Her product is sold through local distributors, neighbors, and relatives. Like with any crops, there is always some risk involved due to pests and price fluctuations in the market. \r\n\r\nCurrently Mar\u00eda is requesting help in order to invest in her potato crops. She will buy fertilizers and pumps to fumigate her product in order to help keep it healthy and clear of pests.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to grow a variety of products to offer her customers, so that they can have more purchasing options. This would allow her to generate more income for her family and invest in her crops in order to work with her own capital. Her dream is to see her daughter graduate from university and obtain a useful degree so she may take charge of her land and, eventually, manage the business and create employment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1343300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer and pumps to fumigate her potato crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T22:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T22:10:01Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Expectacion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.74,"local_amount":14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":14.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381922843},{"amount":0.54,"local_amount":10.24,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":10.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390787323},{"amount":0.31,"local_amount":5.78,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399793689},{"amount":0.27,"local_amount":5.17,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070253},{"amount":364.96,"local_amount":6869.91,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7036.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833651},{"amount":58.18,"local_amount":1094.9,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1121.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042164}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T23:24:42Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":554399,"name":"Shehrish Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shehrish is 23--young, energetic and a hard-working woman.

She sells the coffee in her district on a small scale to neighbours, relatives, friends and some purchasers who come to the district.  Her parents taught her how to perform this activity in her youth and she has been doing it for more than 20 years. Nowadays she has her own way of doing things. \r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting help to buy fertilizers and manure to nurture her coffee crop so that there will be a healthy and bountiful harvest to make a good profit. She will be able to reinvest the profit she makes into the same crop. \r\n\r\nHer short-term goals are to save money to be able to work in her own way to increase her crops and to begin dedicating more time to this work to strengthen her family's estate which will be inherited by her son, who is currently the only one who helps her.

She provides stitching services in her community. Her eldest daughter also helps her in stitching up dresses. She has excellent stitching skills and due to the money she generates, she has managed to provide a better quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to expand her business and to purchase one more sewing machine as her number of customers are increasing day by day. However, because of having only one machine she cannot easily cope up with all customers on time and that results in a loss of money and customers. \r\n\r\nTherefore, she is asking for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to invest in the purchase of a sewing machine which will allow her to fulfill the demands of customers more efficiently and to elevate her level of income. \r\n\r\nWith the profit, she wishes to start a general store business in her home selling a variety of products including biscuits, tea packs and rice.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan with her children and husband. Her husband is a rickshaw driver and he loves his family and claims they are his greatest strength for getting up each morning and working hard to generate an income. \r\n\r\nAt present his rickshaw has stopped working, and because of that he is not able to generate any income to meet the needs of his family. He wants to fix the rickshaw as soon as possible as it is the only source of income for his family. \r\n\r\nFozia has requested for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband. The loan amount will help her husband to fix his rickshaw so that he can continue his business. \r\n\r\nHer house is under construction, but because construction material is expensive they haven't been able to complete it. Therefore with the profit amount Fozia wishes to complete the construction of her house. She is hopeful that the loan will be a productive one for her family.

She lives in Sachkhere District, with her parents and brother. Maia requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMaia works as a nurse, looks after a child, and has a small monthly income. Her father and brother work as artisans, locally. Together, they make hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRecently, Maia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Maia has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith this credit, Maia will rent a commercial space and open a clothing shop. She will purchase clothing at wholesale prices and resell them in her shop. The new business initiative will significantly increase the monthly income of the family. With the increased income, they will be able to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1342146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She lives in the small village of Sachkhere District with her parents and brother. Mariam requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows and 0.75 hectare of agricultural land. They produce dairy products to sell locally. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMariam requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Mariam has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Mariam will purchase all the needed equipment, rent a commercial space and open a beauty salon. She had been working in a beauty salon and is very experienced in this field. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly increase the monthly income of the family and they will be able to improve their living conditions.

She lives a solitary life, as her husband is outside the country for work reasons. \r\n\r\nTherefore the burden of work is Clara's responsibility, and in order to raise her three children she has to work from the early hours of the morning until very late, according to the need of her crops for irrigation, soil preparation, planting, mechanical pest control, harvest, post-harvest and marketing of products. \r\n\r\nShe also has a problem with the isolated location of her land during the rainy season, as her parcel is located facing the Misque river. Because of the high water at that time, it is inaccessible, therefore the crops develop with pest and disease problems until the water goes down.

They engage in a variety of activities like sales, service, food sales, etc. \r\n\r\nVictor, forty-nine, lives here.  He's married and has three older children who are in college, which costs a lot.  His wife is a teacher.  \r\n\r\nTo earn his daily bread and get his family ahead, Victor has been working for many years buying and selling construction materials such as cement, bricks, sand, stone, etc.  He takes his car to buy from distributors and then deliver products to his clients at their work sites.  This way he makes money from the purchase and sale as well as the transport of the goods.

She sells her products door to door, traveling around the city. She does not have a fixed schedule or fixed days to go out and sell. She also decides on her days and schedules depending on her clients. She sells on credit and collects money every 8 days. She has been in this business for more than four years, which is why food is never lacking in her home.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy shoes and underwear.

She is both mother and father to two small children, ages five and eight, for whom she gives her life and struggles every day to provide them with a better future.\r\n\r\nDespite the problems Ruth has had to face, with much effort and savings she was able to set up a grocery store, \"bodeguita\" in Per\u00fa, where she sells vegetables, sodas and beer.  She works around nine hours and attends to up to 15 customers a day.  She believes things are going well because she is kind to the customers and, above all else, offers quality products at low prices.\r\n\r\nRuth is very grateful to Kiva lenders for their support because, thanks to their help, she can buy shelving, display cases and merchandise for her business.  This will enable her to exhibit her products better and offer a wider variety of goods to her customers.  This will improve her income so she can continue working toward her goal: \"To own her own plot of land and build her own house\".\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1331618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy display cases, shelving and merchandise for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-01T07:03:49Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-31T07:03:49Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth Lizett","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":174.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":183.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":188.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":195.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":205.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":211.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":220.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":236.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":247.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":255.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.5,"local_amount":152.57,"processed_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":153.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889506},{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":174.32,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":175.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664404},{"amount":145.13,"local_amount":372.13,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":374.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775836},{"amount":76.27,"local_amount":195.57,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":196.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054303},{"amount":80.04,"local_amount":205.22,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":206.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819221},{"amount":546.07,"local_amount":1400.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1408.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472185}],"funded_date":"2013-05-09T06:19:45Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:23:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":548477,"name":"Sociedad 12 De Abril  (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Sociedad 12 de Abril esta formado por 10 mujeres quienes son comerciantes y han formado una gran familia en un mercado de la ciudad, se ayudan mutuamente y todas tienen un objetivo en com\u00fan que es mejorar su econom\u00eda y sacar  adelante sus familias.

Her marriage has resulted in two children, one of whom is studying at school while the other attends kindergarten.

Tiego is 21 years old and was asked the following questions by a staff member of the Institute:\r\n\r\nWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute and what classes do you enjoy most?\r\n\u201cI am studying (for) a Bachelors degree in Business Administration. I enjoy working with numbers, and I am still adapting to business courses as I did not do business in high school. Yoga Asanas and Meditation help me a lot with dealing with stress when coming to multi-tasking.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after graduation?\r\n\u201cAfter graduation, I want to work in a business organization, maybe the finance part, because I am good at handling finances. I will be very happy if I can work in Limpopo (Polokwane city) or Johannesburg, as they say home is where the heart is. After five years of working, I will then start to invest in properties and build an orphanage home for underprivileged children.\u201d\r\n\r\nTell us about your background?\r\n\u201cI was born in Gauteng, but moved to Limpopo when I was still young. I am the only child to my parents. My mother passed away seven years back; she was a hawker and she did everything to provide for me and my family. My father does not have a stable job. He does piece jobs like building.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\r\n\u201cIn my spare time I like to write about my past, present and future. Writing helps me to see how far I have come and see that the sky is the limit for me. I am a dreamer and my dreams always become true. I also enjoy reading motivational books and quotes because they keep me going.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow will the Kiva loan change your life?\r\n\u201cThe Kiva loan will change my life to help me reach my goals, especially the stipend that I will be getting, because I will invest it until I am through with my studies so when I want to start a property business in the future, I will know that I have a start-up plan.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":466.67,"image":{"id":1338519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He fattens them and takes their meat to the central bazaar, where butchers and customers purchase this. People use mutton for traditional dishes like kababs, dolmas, pilovs, etc. \r\n\r\nHe has taken loan from Aqroinvest three times and has a good loan history. This is going to be his 4th loan. This time he requires 2000 AZN in order to purchase 15 sheep in order to sell more meat in summer. He is optimistic about this loan, because in summer more people consume meat, due to the holidays and increased customers in restaurants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1338471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He's from one of the towns in Chinandega, located in western Nicaragua, a coastal area where the predominant business is fishing because it's located on one of the beaches of Nicararagua.\r\n\r\nHis business is fishing, which he does with his own equipment.  His children have learned the trade and they work.  He has had the business for several years.  He started at a very young age because he couldn't study for a university degree because he came from a very poor family and didn't have the economic resources.  With his job he saved money until he was able to buy part of his fishing equipment.\r\n\r\nCurrently F\u00e9lix is requesting financing to buy work equipment so he can upgrade the equipment he has.\r\n\r\nOne of his dreams is to be able to buy another boat so he can earn more income.  He's very grateful to the Kiva lenders for the help they offer low-income people.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1329885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

He's from a town in Chinandega, located in the north of the country, a region whose strongest industries are, among others, cattle sales, agriculture, mining, and coffee growing.  At first he earned his living as a bricklayer, but due to economic problems, he no longer had steady work.  So with help from his father, who raised cattle, he started his own cattle business and has been in business for 5 years now buying and selling heads of cattle in his own and neighboring towns.  He travels around buying in cash and selling in cash and for credit.  \r\n\r\nOne of Ricardo Jos\u00e9's dreams is to increase his working capital so his son can have a better future, finish college, and have a profession.
