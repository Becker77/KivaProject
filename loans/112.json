In order to improve their living conditions, the couple has been trying a variety of jobs, ranging from small retail to breakfast food service. In 2005, she joined the TYM fund and was able to borrow 3,000,000 Vietnamese Dong. She bought frogs and fish to breed and raise in the pond in her yard. In addition, she continues to serve breakfast to local customers. At the moment, her family is taking care of 5 frog stalls, which can be harvested every 3 months. She managed to improve the family\u2019s living conditions through clever use of its money. The family\u2019s income is now stable at 3,500,000 Vietnamese Dong per month.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Because of their hard work, they have been able to obtain their own house. For 4 years, she has been purchasing wood to make it into charcoal. Delfina gets help from her husband, who makes the charcoal so that she can then sell it at the market. She really likes her job because she is learning about respect mre and more each day, and because she gets to know a lot of people, thus expanding her client-base. Her business is profitable due to the fact that charcoal is in high demand, especially for their main customers\u2014people who do not have gas stoves. Delfina would like to later sell her products outside the region. This is her first loan with MFP. She likes to work with her microfinance institute because she has noticed that the other members are responsible people who communicate with each other and are team players.

G. is 50 years old and married to Vicente G. who is presently managing the boarding house that they own. The couple is blessed with 2 children who have already graduated from college.  The older, 28 years old, is a teacher while the younger is 26 years old and works with the  Coastguard. The family lives in the village of Sitio Serena, Brgy Enclaro, Binalbagan Negros Occidental. <P>\r\n\r\nIt was always Amalia's dream to be able to send her children to school so they would have their own jobs, and to help her husband pay for their household expenses -- and she has done all this with the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon.<P>\r\n\r\nAmalia joined NWTF-PD in January 1995 and used the first cycle loan to start a general or \"sari-sari\" store. Since it was in a good location, she was able to earn a good income, and she used her subsequent loans to continue improving the operations of her general store. Later, they started taking in boarders, and her husband took care of managing the boarding house. She was able to earn a net monthly income of PHP 6,000 from her businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nWith the help of her loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, plus her own efforts and the support of her family, she was able to send her 2 children to school until they finished their college education, a fulfillment of one of her most cherished dreams. She has also acquired a few productive assets such as a refrigerator for her general store, and she had electricity and water pumps installed in her boarding house. <P>\r\n\r\nNow Amalia is helping some members of her extended family by supporting the education of her nephew, paying tuition and providing him with an allowance so that he will have some spending money while in school. <P>\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, Amalia borrowed Php 19,500 which she used as additional working capital, using part of the income to support her nephew's education. Now she is borrowing for her 14th loan the amount of PHP 23,000, again as additional capital for her general store. She intends to use the income to continue supporting not only her immediate family but she hopes to also improve the lives of other relatives so that they too will achieve their potential just like her own children. This is her way of practicing being \"Dungganon\" (honorable)<P>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: <P>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but of thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":409864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her previous loan of PHP 22500, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

is a widow who lives in E.B. Magalona, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three businesses: vegetable farming, food vending and frozen foods. She has no children. \r\n\r\nNelida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nelida has been lifting herself out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use to fund her business operations. Nelida is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the community's respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been in this business since 2001.   \r\n\r\nValentina is very polite and competent. She is highly respected among other entrepreneurs in the local market. Convenient locations for her two vending facilities and the trendy clothing and high quality, durable footwear she sells have helped her business be successful. Presently, she has about $2,400 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to around $400. \r\n\r\nValentina is requesting a loan for $1,000 to increase her inventory. She is planning to purchase seasonal footwear, sweaters, jumpers, skirts and pants.

These small, black and dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to charcoal sellers but to their customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame, and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task.

Merilyn has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Merilyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Merilyn has successfully repaid previous loans from GDMPC.  Merilyn O.'s group is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Merilyn from GDMPC.

Ahora esta pensando sembrar ma\u00edz hibrido (llamado tambi\u00e9n polenta), ya que tiene mayor demanda en la zona; de la misma manera sembrar\u00e1 plantas estables como c\u00edtricos y con ello asegurar\u00e1 su producci\u00f3n en el futuro. Como tambi\u00e9n desea invertir en la creaci\u00f3n de una tienda de comestibles, donde pueda vender productos de primera necesidad a los pobladores del lugar, ya que por ser una zona alejada de la ciudad no hay negocio de este rubro. Ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cAbejitas de Pumpuriani\u201d, y este es el quinto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde espera de su colaboraci\u00f3n para que pueda concretar sus planes. Por otro lado se compromete una vez m\u00e1s a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo. Adem\u00e1s le agrada ser parte de su banco comunal porque todos sus integrantes son personas responsables y muy solidarias. Nora de obtener su ayuda; invertir\u00e1 el dinero solicitado en la compra de varios sacos de abono org\u00e1nico para esparcirlos en sus cultivos de caf\u00e9. Ya que se fertiliza 3 veces al a\u00f1o para mantenerlos fuertes.   \n\n","en":"Nora, 31, is a strong, tenacious woman.  She lives with Ronald, 26, and they have three children: Josu\u00e9, 12, Yens, 8 and Yoice, 4. They live in their own house located in the Peruvian jungle (native community of Centro Pumpuriani).\r\n\r\nEvery morning, as usual, she takes her daughter Yoice with her to care for her coffee, banana and manioc crops.   What she enjoys doing is weeding, pruning and caring for her plants.  Since the age of 12 her grandmother taught her how to work the soil and subsist from it.  However, she does not enjoy having to walk hours to reach her farmland which is located in a higher zone of her location.  When her crops are mature she sells them to merchants that constantly visit the community.  She does the opposite, though, with the manioc crops: Nora travels once a week to the city\u2019s central market to sell it.\r\n\r\nNow, she\u2019s planning to farm a hybrid strain of corn, also called polenta, since it\u2019s in high demand in the zone.  She will also plant stable plants, like citrus, which will assure future production.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she also wants to invest in a grocery store where she can sell basics to local residents because given that the area is far from the city there are no such businesses there.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a member of the \u201cAbejitas de Pumpuriani\u201d (Little Bees from Pumpuriani) communal bank and this is the fifth loan with MFP where she hopes to have its cooperation to make her plans a reality.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, she once again commits to pay her installments like she\u2019s done with her past loans.  Besides, she enjoys being part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible, mutually supportive people.\r\n\r\nIf Nora were to get this help she will invest the requested money in the purchase of several sacks of organic manure to spread among her coffee crops since they have to be fertilized three times a year in order to keep them strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":789938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy several sacks of organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666211}],"funded_date":"2011-06-14T22:45:26Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":310525,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma is 44 years old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Luckily, his business has been going well, and after a while he was able to buy a second truck.\r\n\r\n<p>At this moment, he needs a loan of $925 that he will use to maintain his trucks to avoid any accident that could occur, and to ensure a high level of service to his customers.

","en":"Felix Antonio R. M. is 55 years old and has 5 children, all of whom live independently. He repairs and sells parts for electrical appliances--a business which he started about 20 years ago. Since then, he has offered his services installing electrical equipment, and repairing fans, blenders, irons, TVs, and all kinds of other appliances that might be related to his line of work. Felix has been a person who has had to face some very difficult times, and although his greatest worry is that he will fall seriously ill, he believes that it is better to die fighting than to never have tried at all. This time, Felix has come to Fundacion Leon 2000 for financing that he will use for the purchase of things like wire, electrical outlets, work lights, and other equipment that cost more money than he has right now, but which he needs in order to continue getting by. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cyrus Maher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":329309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-06-05T20:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":716.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956981},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":716.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174422},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":716.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599886},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":716.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035775},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":716.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948173},{"amount":4.94,"local_amount":92.21,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":94.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790108},{"amount":34.34,"local_amount":641,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":656.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790109},{"amount":35.72,"local_amount":666.79,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":682.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680781},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":700.84,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":717.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075325},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":699.16,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":716.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911378},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:10Z","rounded_local_amount":716.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947227}],"funded_date":"2009-06-12T17:30:50Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cyrus Maher","image":null}},{"id":117106,"name":"Editha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Editha has a business vending different kinds of vegetables in her rural village of San Jose Norte 1 in Mallig, Isabela.

The majority sell clothing, food, snacks and cosmetics from catalogs. They have a high level of competence because the women have a lot of experience and know how to advance their businesses by offering various products of good quality.

The women of this community bank have ample knowledge of how to work in solidarity groups because of their previous participation in similar groups with Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital where they are finishing their second loan cycle. This indicates their ability to manage funds, repay responsibly, and, above all, the unity within their group helps them economically and allows them to continue growing.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated

She is 35 years old, married, and has 2 children aged nine and fourteen years old who are presently attending school. She works hard because she wants to give her children all they need, including good food, an education and a good family to support them when they grow up.  She also wants to help her husband earn additional income for their family.\r\n\r\nIn the past, she was a plain housewife whose main day-to-day activity was to take good care of her children and husband. She would wait for her husband to bring home his salary and then budget it for the week.  However, she noticed that the budget was never enough for the whole week. She thought of trying to start a business so she could earn money and help her husband, which is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon.   Having some capital to invest in business, Ma. Lourdes decided to try her luck with a ready-to-wear and used clothing business. She goes to different places to sell her goods. She wakes up early to go to market and sell her wares so that she can earn more income. From her business, she is able to earn PHP 10,000 every month, which is a big help to her family, especially for the education of her two children.\r\n\r\nMa. Lourdes\u2019 previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used to buy additional clothes, both ready-to-wear and used. Because the funds went toward her business, she was able to maintain a good credit rating by paying her previous loan on time and in full, without any delay. Now, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing the same amount of PHP 19,500, which she will use for her business, to save for her children\u2019s education, and for household expenses.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, Ma. Lourdes is involved in her business during market day.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned its respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":429373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"additional working capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-21T20:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

She is the group leader of a four-member group with a loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMercilyn is widowed and has three school-aged children. She owns and operates a retail store selling soft drinks, snack food, noodles, eggs, shampoo, toothpaste, cooking oil, vinegar, soy sauce and other daily use products in the local community. Mercilyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mercilyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mercilyn is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Mercilyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He was employed before he ventured into the farming business.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for 45,000 KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow. This loan will enable him to acquire a quality cow that will produce enough milk and earn him enough income to provide for his family. His main challenges in this business are lack of enough market for his milk and poor transportation that has led to delays in getting the milk to the market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With this loan of KES 40,000, his second loan with KADET, he intends to use KES 25,000 to increase his stock of food supplies and household goods and KES 15,000 to repair and build a carrier for his motorbike to enable him to transport many goods at once. Julius plans to plough back the extra profits into his supplies business since he gets many orders and some of his clients need him to extend credit periods. This will help him run the business comfortably. Julius hopes to expand his business and buy land where he can build his own house.

All are married and living on their own.\r\nShe sells mattresses, bedspreads, and curtains.  By her own initiative  and because of  her financial need, she started her business 10 years ago with money that she had saved from her previous work.  She is requesting the loan to buy mattresses, bedspreads and curtains.  She sells these items in Moyotepec to her neighbors and acquaintances.  She is a street merchant and walks or takes communal taxis.  Her business is important because it is her only source of income and she can make a profit and reinvest in purchasing merchandise.\r\nThe challenge that she faces with her business is that during the hot season, sales drop.\r\n\r\nMoyotepec is a pretty town that holds its Saint\u2019s Day on January 6th, the three Kings.  There are masses, first communions, baptisms, dances, and bullfighting.  There are fields where corn, onions, and sugar cane are planted.\r\nHer dreams and hopes are to continue working, selling mattresses, bedspreads and curtains and that her son and daughters are well and get ahead with their children and their families.\r\n\r\nShe wants to tell Kiva and the Realidad Foundation that she gives them thanks, and thanks to you, we can get ahead and continue progressing and realize our dreams and help more people.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":785453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy mattresses, bedspreads and curtains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110.01,"local_amount":1257.21,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512753},{"amount":123.32,"local_amount":1409.47,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223398},{"amount":104.48,"local_amount":1194.01,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1230.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201675},{"amount":187.19,"local_amount":2139.34,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2204.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807265},{"amount":126.42,"local_amount":1444.81,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1488.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618401},{"amount":48.58,"local_amount":555.16,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":572.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572722}],"funded_date":"2011-06-16T00:41:02Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:03:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":310541,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanita is 56 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She owns two motorcycle rickshaws, which for five years have been the source of income for her family.  These vehicles are driven by her husband and her son, who transport passengers in them.  Eliana is in charge of managing their daily profits.  What she likes about this business is being able to see their income every day.  Additionally, Eliana sells used clothing, which she takes from house to house to sell in different places in their area.  This is her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She likes to work with her communal bank because there is a lot of camaraderie and responsibility to make their payments.  This is why they named their bank, \"Trabajando Juntos\" (Working Together).  One thousand soles of this money will be invested in repairing and maintenance of the motorcycle rickshaws.  The rest will go towards purchasing more used clothing to sell.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":291230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To repair her motorcycle rickshaws","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":157.92},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":170.34},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":177.15},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":182.89},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":190.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200.01},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":206.03},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":215.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.48},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.68},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.63,"local_amount":157.92,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":165.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012264},{"amount":56.78,"local_amount":170.34,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:55Z","rounded_local_amount":178.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595846},{"amount":59.05,"local_amount":177.15,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":185.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990113},{"amount":60.97,"local_amount":182.89,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":191.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211239},{"amount":63.48,"local_amount":190.45,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":199.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640749},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":209.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080214},{"amount":68.68,"local_amount":206.03,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":215.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996478},{"amount":71.74,"local_amount":215.21,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":225.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841986}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T20:47:43Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":100738,"name":"Dure","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dure A. currently sells onions, tomatoes and cooking oil and is requesting a loan to open up a shop.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her business is very profitable because it does not require much of her time and she can continue her day job as a dental assistant.  In the evenings and on the weekends, she devotes herself entirely to selling beauty products.  Being an industrious woman who likes to look good, Juana is very credible when convincing her frequent customers to buy cosmetics.  She has learned a great deal about sales in the workshops her company offers.  As a result, she has become a leader in her district.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Juana\u2019s seventh loan with MFP.

He is 47 years old, married and the father of 5 children who are 18, 15, 9 and 5 years old and the youngest is 2 months old. The oldest three children go to school. He only went to school until the 8th grade and didn't because he was drafted for mandatory military service. He lives with his family in his own house and doesn't support anyone else. \r\n\r\nHe left Chibuto to go to Boane looking for a better life. He has had his own business for more than 5 years and has 3 employees who help him. He has an income of around 7.000.00mt per month, which goes towards household expenses and he still manages to save some money in his savings account. \r\n\r\nHe has never requested loans with other banks. He came to know Hluvuku through friends who were already partners of the institution.  This loan, in the amount of 25.000.00mt, is his first and he intends to buy building materials for resale (zinc screens, cement, stone and others) in order to increase his inventory. \r\n\r\nHe is committed to paying this loan on time in order to be able to request other loans. In the future, he would like to request more loans to develop his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva

remained strong and tough to face more challenges to achieve her goal of bringing her family out of the shadow of poverty. Loans that she has taken out through her membership in ASHI have equipped her to have her own business and income to augment the small and sporadic earnings of her husband who works as a laborer. Eventually, Evangeline\u2019s small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store has grown and has been able to acquire more customers from their neighborhood and even from other villages. Sari-sari means that various foodstuffs, beverages and an assortment of grocery items are sold in a small open room of their house. \r\n\r\nEvangeline is currently happy with the achievements of her business. However, its proceeds are still too small for her to set up a savings fund since almost everything her family needs for food, clothing, etc. are provided through this. Therefore, Evangeline is requesting a much larger loan so she can increase the inventory of her store and sustain its operation despite providing credit to her customers. Soon all four of her children will be in school with her eldest in college and her second eldest in high school. Through her business's profit, Evangeline hopes to support her children until they earn their own degree in college and have a better future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":538606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

M. is a 56-year-old pepper farmer and father of five who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. The rural zone where Arnulfo and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Arnulfo is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour.\r\n\r\nArnulfo is a dedicated farmer and father. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of tabasco and cayenne peppers. He works in cooperation with his wife to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land they work is their own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Arnulfo works at a local orange-processing factory as a harvesting laborer in order to supplement his family income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and food.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Arnulfo and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of tabasco and cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Arnulfo with the help of his family members. Arnulfo will need roughly one year before his peppers reach maturity and are ready for harvest.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market.\r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the mornings, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and sending the children to school. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvesting, planting, and working the land as needed. Arnulfo spends some days working as a laborer in the nearby orange-processing factory, but this work is sporadic.\r\n\r\nArnulfo says the main factor that has stood in the way of increasing his production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions. Formal banks, lending agencies and government bodies have failed to recognize the producers of the Coquital region as legitimate producers, worthy of financial and governmental support and services.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Arnulfo, his family and his community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Arnulfo wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented; he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighborhood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":555098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and nutrients necessary for the production of peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coquital, San Carlos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arnulfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":63943.24},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":65008.96},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66092.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":67193.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":68313.89},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":69447.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.89},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.95},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.06},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.19},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.36},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":108.63,"local_amount":56066.7,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":57519.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172258702},{"amount":231.46,"local_amount":119464.4,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":122559.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411581},{"amount":9.3,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4924.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551338},{"amount":166.5,"local_amount":85937.8,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":88164.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148757},{"amount":58.13,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":30777.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428373},{"amount":102.34,"local_amount":52823,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54191.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970506},{"amount":98.64,"local_amount":50908.1,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":52226.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289959}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T20:52:19Z","paid_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":212208,"name":"Norma Eulogia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cQORICHUSPA\u201d; La socia vive en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia de Cusco, del departamento de Cusco.\n\t\nLa  socia es la Sra.

Mambaroto, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Tobacco vending and vegetable vending businesses. Her husband Mamerto E., who is 56 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have ten children between 15 and  36 years old. \r\n\r\nPerfecta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Perfecta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for tobacco vending so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nPerfecta E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

UDEs are groups of 10 or more people who have a bank account and have to meet weekly or bi-weekly to make their payments.  They have a representative and a governing committee.  This group is located in the community of Tezonapa in the state of VeraC..  It has 10 members. \r\n\r\nThe group's representative is Eloisa C. S..  She is 45 years old and only attended elementary school.  She is widowed and has a small daughter named Lesli Alexandra who is 10 years old and in the 5th grade.

She tells us that she has the most work in September and November when her customers order school uniforms for their children.  She also tells us that for her town's festival, she sews costumes for the dancers in the \"comparsa\" (parade). Over the years she has also learned to repair and perform maintenance on her sewing machines and now her friends and acquaintances seek her out to repair their machines, so she earns a little extra money.  She needs this loan to invest in a new sewing machine, needles, thread, measuring tape, hooks, rulers, fabrics, lace, ribbons, buttons, and fasteners.

32-year-old young lady. She is a mother to two children whom she loves very much; they are the greatest gift that God has given her and she fights every day in order to give them a good life, and above all to give them everything that she didn't have as a child, since due to few economic resources her parents were only able to let her study until the fourth grade of secondary school (9th grade), but she would have loved to have a career in accounting.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Lucy gets up very early in order to do the household chores and then leaves to visit her clients, since she has a business selling beauty products and shoes from a catalog. She works about nine hours per day and can attend to about five clients daily. She believes that she is getting ahead in business because she is very friendly with her clients.\r\n\r\nLucy is very thankful for the Kiva loans since, thanks to the help that they have brought her, she will be able to improve her home since she will buy wood, iron, and other materials in order to repair her roof. This will improve the quality of life for her family and she will be able to continue fighting in order to make her biggest dream a reality: to finish building her house and to give a good education to her children."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1273330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase raw materials such as wood and iron, among others\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":59.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":68.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":74.98},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":74.53},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":78.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":80.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":87.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":95.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":99.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":103.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.3},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Lemon","image":1116905}},{"id":585547,"name":"Irine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jerotich lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is extremely fertile for agriculture.

work and to run a business that is the main source of income for her family. Although her husband also works, he does not have a steady job, and for this reason, Muhayyo and her eldest son are in trade.  Muhayyo herself processes the salted apricot pits at home, and then exports them abroad.  It is hard work and time-consuming.  First, the apricot pits are cracked, then slightly blanched in a special brine.  After blanching, the pits are spread out in a thin layer in the sun to dry. The pits are ready for sale in a few hours.  Muhayyo's eldest son sells a variety of vegetables in the central market, and this also goes into the family kitty.  Since the price of apricot pits has now dropped and she wants to stock up for the future, Muhayyo decided to take out a small loan to expand her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":310416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of apricot pits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-04T15:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhayyo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":226.14},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":235.19},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":244.59},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":254.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":264.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":275.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.3,"local_amount":226.14,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":237.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44600079},{"amount":62.72,"local_amount":235.19,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-26T07:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":247.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994493},{"amount":65.22,"local_amount":244.59,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":257,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215743},{"amount":67.83,"local_amount":254.38,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":267.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645231},{"amount":70.55,"local_amount":264.55,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":277.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084801},{"amount":73.38,"local_amount":275.15,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":289.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000997}],"funded_date":"2009-05-07T01:30:01Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":108946,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema has been a bites seller in the Mikunguni neighborhood of Zanzibar for six months.

She makes chicha (a beverage made from fermented wheat) and is a dairy farmer who produces milk from her three cows.  She is a very hard-working and responsible woman, having started to work from a very early age with her mother who did the same kind of work in Mallco ranch.\r\nHer mother died over 5 years ago and now Cristina has two small children.  She strives to provide them with a good education and is always watchful of them especially since one of them has a learning disability so she is particularly focused on this child.\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to buy a plot of land on which she can build a home for her children since the house they currently occupy was actually her mother's and her siblings are asking her to vacate so they can sell it and divide the sales profits among them.  She hopes in the future to be able to secure an additional loan to buy more cows so that she can earn increased profits and improve her quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband and children in the Hamdallaye neighborhood in the Koutiala prefecture (Sikasso region of Mali).\r\n\r\nFor socio-economic reasons she did not go to school, and so she became very involved with various commercial activities.  Madame Konat\u00e9 finally opted for the catering trade, which she picked up from her mother.  She has done this for nearly seven years. She is highly sought after in her neighborhood, particularly during the morning when she is very busy.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop and improve her business, Madame Konat\u00e9 wasted no time in turning to micro-finance institution Solo Yiriwaso four years ago.\r\nAfter four group loans, all fully repaid without difficulty, she is now on to her third individual loan, the previous two having been successfully completed.\r\nWith this new loan, she intends to buy five sacks of beans from the grain wholesalers in Koutiala, 10 cases of spaghetti and food condiments. She sells bean fritters and several other prepared foods (e.g., cooked bean seeds, spaghetti)  in front of her house, to a client\u00e8le of both men and women for cash.\r\n\r\nMadame Konat\u00e9 hopes to generate a monthly income of 100,000 FCFA, which she will use to pay the interest to Soro Yiriwaso and to pay her daily household expenses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":429444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy ingredients for her catering business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152388},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021500},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778854},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699301},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180450},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476507}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T16:50:09Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":158313,"name":"Nabih","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nabih is a 22-year-old single man who lives with his parents.

In the new forest neighborhood of the Cartagena D. Indias city, where she lives the idea of having a business was born. A friend helped her come up with ideas for the best way to run a business. So, her sister lent her a small amount of capital to get started and she began with a catalogue. Today, in order to diversify her selection, she manages 10 catalogue businesses. Thanks to this business she was able to see her children move forward, and now, she is so excited to know that they are both professionals.\r\n\r\nNow she is asking for a second loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to invest in the purchase of a new line of highly desirable leather purses for her commercial clients. Since she arrived at this organization, almost a year ago, she has had available cash to buy many affordable offerings, especially in new product lines, and been able to offer them at a better price to her customers, and obviously, generate more income for herself. Her big dream is to bring her daughter into the business to improve the lives of her children, whom her daughter raises and educates on her own, and this is precisely her biggest challenge; to have a large store and to generate a good business with her daughter. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jo Longnecker, Kiva

He sells fruits from a shop located in the very busy market of Samundri, offering fresh seasonal fruits to his clients. By having a shop in the busiest market, he faces high competition every day with other fruit shops. To compete with them and become more successful than them, he has to keep his shop up-to-date with seasonal fruits to fulfill the timely needs of his customers and to make them his permanent customers.  \r\n\r\nSafia has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner Asasah for the betterment of her husband\u2019s business. He will use the loan money to purchase fresh seasonal fruits in bulk to sell to his customers. Safia is hopeful that an investment will help her husband increase his sales and income. She is a regular lender with Asasah and this is her 4th loan application. In previous loan years, she has established a good credit record by paying her installments on time.   \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, Safia is holding a book (the Asasah
