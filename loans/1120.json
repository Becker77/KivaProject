His wife supports him in the business. Beside taking care of the children at home, she helps with feeding the cows and milking them. The business takes a lot of  effort, but together they run it successfully. \r\nNadir sells the meat in the central bazaar, where the demand for meat is high. People in Azerbaijan consume meat a lot, because it is used in most dishes. Some traditional meals like kebabs, dolma and others require beef in their preparation. His profit is 120 AZN monthly. Nadir is applying for new loan of 1,900 AZN, in order to expand the business by buying new calves.

The whole family works hard to gather good harvest and sell it in the local market.\r\n\r\nRealizing that agriculture is the main source of income for the family, Alita would like to expand it.

In the region there is a high unemployment rate, but a farm business helps the family have some stable income. Both husband and sons are involved in their small farm, and for a start they already have some livestock. Together with Emma, they keep 4 cows, 13 lambs and 14 chickens. The family also owns agricultural land where they cultivate barley and tomatoes. \r\n\r\nEmma has applied to SEF International for a loan. With the loan's help, she will purchase potato and barley seeds, fuel for taking the gathered harvest to the market and 5 little pigs. This will significantly increase her farming business and will give her an opportunity to gather more

The whole family helps her sell her products locally and generate income which is vital for the family. Because the family has a hard time covering its daily costs, she lacks sufficient funds to invest in her farm.

She earns a living for her family through animal husbandry. She started out after the breakup of the Soviet Union with 10,000 soms (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Batmakan's farm now has 2 head of cattle with calves, and 3.7 hectares of land planted in potatoes and perennial grasses. With the goal of expanding her business, Batmakan has turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners Microlending Bank for a loan in the amount of 55,000 soms (KGS) to buy a sheep and pesticides to apply to the soil. Batmakan plans to invest the proceeds gained from the loan into further augmenting her number of livestock, as well as to save up for the children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1340955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a sheep and pesticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Koprobazar village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-05-01T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-31T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batmakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":522.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":627.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":522.73,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25234.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426883},{"amount":611.9,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":30281.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.37,"payment_id":467830775}],"funded_date":"2013-05-06T03:18:47Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T10:23:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peter and Lynne Weil","image":null}},{"id":554122,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is a 24-year-old single guy.

","en":"Marifat is a loving mother of three children and sells jewelry at the local market. Previously she sold children's clothes, but the business had become less and less profitable. Her friends and acquaintances have been selling jewelry for a while and Marifat also decided to try her hand at selling silver. Her youngest son helps Marifat manage the store when Marifat herself is away to purchase more inventory. This year Marifat is planning to have a wedding for her daughter as she has many suitors. She wants to provide a nice dowry for her daughter so she is saving money for this summer's wedding. Marifat plans to use this loan to increase goods turnover and expand her

Therefore, he is interested in growing his business. \r\n\r\nAmna has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Paksitan, which she will use for her husband's business. The loan amount will help her husband to buy welding materials, such as iron rods, welding rods, soldering rods, and iron sheets. This supply of materials will help him to earn more income. Amna will spend the profit amount to meet the household expenses. \r\n\r\nIn their area, the major problem is load shedding (rolling blackouts), which affect the business of her husband.

is 37 years old. He lives in a small village of Sachkhere District, with his wife, three children and parents. HIs parents are provided with a retirement pension. Mikheil requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. They have three milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. They sell cheese at local markets at a good price. They earn hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRecently, Mikheil requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Mikheil has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit Mikheil will purchase a minibus. After purchasing a minibus, he will be able to transport people and increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up Loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith her credit Madona will start trading in flour.

Gina's husband is a security guard.\r\n\r\nGina is a great mother and wife who, in order to make her own income so that she can help her husband with their children's educational expenses, works selling both catalog clothing and Avon, Esika and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and ladies' accessories).  She works every day and makes her sales door to door, though some of her most trusted customers come to her home where she keeps her merchandise.  She leaves her products with her customers on credit and collects payment every weekend.  She has been in this business for more than six years and it is going very well.\r\n\r\nGina is requesting this loan to buy perfume, creams, cosmetics, pants, blouses and other items of clothing.  She has been a member of her community bank for more than two years and likes it because the repayments are easy.\r\n\r\nGina's dream is to have premises where she can sell her clothing and other products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1330111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfume, creams, cosmetics, pants, blouses and other items of clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-05-01T22:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-31T22:00:01Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gina Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1507.56,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":508.33,"local_amount":502.52,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":508.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927035},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":251.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":254.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381704093},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":251.26,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":254.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566517},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":376.89,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":381.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815539},{"amount":127.08,"local_amount":125.63,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":127.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410965805}],"funded_date":"2013-05-04T14:50:32Z","paid_date":"2013-10-21T08:54:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":554520,"name":"Margareth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Zimbabwe!

This city has been known for many years as the City of the Royal Tamarind Trees.\r\n\r\nThis is where Flor, age 40, lives.  She is married, and they have two children, ages 19 and 14.  The children attend high school and the university, and they still live with her.  Her husband works at a hotel. \r\n\r\nShe learned about beauty and grooming at an educational center in this city.  She did this in order to be able to earn something on her own.  Several years ago she installed a beauty salon in her house.  \r\n\r\nShe does diverse jobs like dyes, haircuts, and painting nails, among other jobs.  She works every day from 8:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m.  Sometimes she works later if her customers require her services.  \r\n\r\nShe also sells beauty products, which she has in display cases in her salon.  She sells at the same time that she is doing her work.  She has been doing this business activity for over 14 years.

She has been in this line of work for five years now and she is proud to be contributing to the household income. When Zeenat was not working, her family went through a severe financial crisis.  This improved when she began to use her sewing skills in a productive manner and started earning for her family members. Previously, her husband was the sole bread winner of the family, and due to limited resources none of their five children were sent to school. Therefore, Zeenat felt it obligatory to change her family\u2019s standard of living and started working from home.\r\n\r\nZeenat has been having difficulty fulfilling large orders so her neighbor advised her to borrow from Kiva partner the Kashf Foundation. Currently she has requested a loan of Rs. 30,000 and her loan will be used to purchase a new sewing machine. She is presently in her seventh loan cycle and she has shown good repayment behavior. She wishes to expand her business in the near future.

Her family is comprised of three siblings, her mother, and a nephew who is the youngest.  Her father died twelve years ago when she was only seven years old.  She suffered greatly from the loss of her father but overcame it with time.  It took a great deal of sacrifice for her mom to get them ahead because she became both mother and father in that very difficult period when they were growing up. Today, they are individuals who are aware of life\u2019s challenges and have goals and projects in mind to now be the ones to help their mother.  Rosa gives thanks to her mother for paying for her studies and supporting her in what she loves because that\u2019s what they need to get ahead: a family that advises and encourages them to fulfill their plans. She wants to be a good nurse, have merit in her work, and stand out because of what she does and the kind of person that she is.   One of her dreams is to learn about many different countries and cultures. She also wants to study English in order to work in the United States and have good financial stability.  \r\n\r\nNow that her mother is no longer living with her, she realizes that nothing is easy because she was accustomed to seeing her every day.  But this makes her stronger and makes her value her mother more, and she is more considerate of her.  Rosa realizes that the fact that her mother left home is frightening to some people, and they think that she left because there were problems in the home, but it isn\u2019t so.  Her mother did it to make them more responsible for their belongings and for the house that their father left them.  Yes, she realizes that having taken charge of the house is very exciting for her.  She can say that she has the most beautiful family because they are very united and very dependent on each other and their mother is the most beautiful because she loves and cares for them very much and she expects that this will remain so for many more years.  \r\n\r\nWith this degree, she will have a secure future and the satisfaction that she did not waste her time, but rather she made the most of it for her personal and overall development.  In addition, continuing her studies in the health care field will enable her to do what she enjoys: helping people in need of her care.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1343178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to complete her degree.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-05-02T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-01T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":280000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":160159.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891057},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":160159.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912462}],"funded_date":"2013-05-02T02:34:55Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Francoletti-Putz","image":null}},{"id":550979,"name":"Encarnacion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Encarnaci\u00f3n pertenece al banco comunal COMUZONE III,la socia continua con su negocio de elaboracion y compra y venta de artesania,la socia lleva buen tiempo en este negocio el cual le va bien gracias al empe\u00f1o que le pone cada dia a su negocio ,la socia desea poder seguir trabajando para de esta forma seguir apoyando a su familia.\n\n\nLa socia Encarnaci\u00f3n solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de lana de alpaca para elaborar chompas para su negocio.\n\n\nLa socia se siente agradecida por el credito otorgado y se compromete  a cumplir con sus cuotas establecidas.\n","en":"Encarnaci\u00f3n belongs to the \"Comuzone III\" community bank.

Satenik works at a local school as a teacher. As she had no opportunity to get higher education when she was young, now she works as a teacher without an educational background. Satenik applied to university last year. Now she is in the second course, studying primary education pedagogy. The salary she earns from teaching at school is barely enough to make ends meet. It is very difficult for her to cover her family\u2019s costs and save money for her education. Satenik has applied for this loan to pay for her university tuition. The loan is very important for Satenik to make her dream come true and have a higher education degree.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1342308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay for her university tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan, Syunik region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-05-02T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-01T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Satenik","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":9999.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10088.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10296.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10252.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10689.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10759.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10851.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":11106.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":11220.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":11392},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":11600.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":11742.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":10005.7,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10290.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373026173},{"amount":25.22,"local_amount":10090.3,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10377.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381815548},{"amount":25.74,"local_amount":10289.4,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10582.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390674337},{"amount":25.63,"local_amount":10255.5,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10547.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399920030},{"amount":26.73,"local_amount":10692.9,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":10997.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410203011},{"amount":58.69,"local_amount":23477.8,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":24145.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420157260},{"amount":121.94,"local_amount":48776.8,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50164.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308339},{"amount":16.05,"local_amount":6411.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6593.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845618}],"funded_date":"2013-05-02T13:43:17Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:26:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":554606,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is 54 years old, married to Harrison, and a mother of six.

She lives in the Zestaponi district with her 31-year-old husband and two daughters (7 and 10 years old). Natia has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nThe only source of income for the family is Natia\u2019s husband\u2019s monthly salary. He is working at the local iron factory as an artisan. Natia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Natia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

advertisement business.\r\n\r\nDespite an unsteady childhood, Glenn grew up with a deep interest in both entrepreneurship and technology. By age 17, he began a small business where he trained others in his community to use computers and designed websites for businesses. After graduating from the University of Georgia with a major in political science, Glenn worked as a project manager for an analytic solutions company for several years. During this time he began crafting the idea for his own business.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Glenn began JLAX\u2014Go Local Display, a digital ad network business. Using his savings, Glenn purchased several 23-inch flat screen monitors and small computers to initially launch his business idea. Glenn installs screens in local businesses and throughout town and then rents out advertisement time to companies. Businesses pay Glenn according to the number of advertisements he runs for them each day. Glenn\u2019s business is already proving to be successful and he now has monitors installed in 23 locations throughout Coffee County, GA and over 50 accounts with local businesses.\r\n\r\nNow looking to expand his business and attract more clients, Glenn needs a loan to purchase more equipment for future locations. Glenn hopes to soon install screens in 26 new locations among three nearby cities.

in Odisha, India, formed a group named Maha Shakti to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their business.  Belmati is one of them, the lady sitting second from right in the photo, raising her hand. Belmati is a poor lady who lives with her husband, one son, and two daughters. Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. The Government have provided a house to her under Indira Awash Yojana (Housing Scheme).\r\n\r\n Belmati has been running a spice items vending business with items like chilly, cumin seeds, coriander, turmeric, garlic, etc. for the last 10 years. Her husband goes to six weekly markets of her locality every week with bulk of items on a moped and sells in the market.  Her monthly income from the existing business is Rs.3000. Out of this income she can hardly manage her household expenses. She wants to increase the stock of her business, so the loan amount will be utilized to purchase items like chilly, coriander, cumin seed, etc.in bulk to keep the business stocked for a month. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently from the nearest market and she can add a substantial income to her present income.\r\n\r\n Belmati hopes to purchase a bike to run her business smoothly with sufficient items and to build a house. The other three members of the group are Deimati, Bela and Rekha who are running a general grocery shop and vegetable vending businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1342458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married to Renato, a driver and a father to their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRosalie operates a fruit stand. She buys seasonal fruits that are native to the Philippines, like bananas and mangoes, which are grown mostly in the south region of Luzon. Her regular customers are the local tourists in their community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Rosalie is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of fruit to expand her product inventory. \r\n\r\nRosalie hopes that her business will continue to grow and that she will have a strong body to do all her responsibilities. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business and to find strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1342657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

With a strong background in architectural design, Federico had the expertise to visualize quality designs and furniture.  Federico\u2019s creations combined with his wife, Haydee\u2019s, decorative taste and eye for design helped them create a successful custom event design and planning business, Concepts Event Design.\r\n\r\nFederico and Haydee have now been in the design business for over 12 years and have created a company that designs and crafts unique, quality weddings and events.  What sets Concepts Event Design apart is Federico\u2019s commitment to providing designs and furniture as special and unique as the wedding couple.  Federico\u2019s custom-made furniture pieces and his wife\u2019s custom-designed linens provide an atmosphere totally unique to each couple.\r\n\r\nFederico trains his staff of 12+ in the importance of crafting an event that will be special and memorable.  He shared his personal work philosophy, \u201cWhen you do something\u2014even placing table settings\u2014do it as if it were your own event.  Our business card is the environment we create and the presentation of our designs.\u201d  \r\n\r\nFor Federico, the best part of owning his own business is seeing the end results and watching the bride and groom\u2019s faces light up with awe.  \u201cMany people dream of their wedding for years.  We love what we do because we know that we were able to deliver what we were hired to do\u2014making dream weddings come true.\u201d\r\n\r\nA loan of $8,000 through Kiva will enable Federico to purchase loading racks to protect and transfer his quality and unique furniture, linens, and other event storage equipment safely through his large warehouse.  With your help, Federico and Haydee can continue to expand their business to provide special events and memories for couples.\r\n\r\nFor more information about Concepts Event Design, Inc, visit

Only the 18-year-old is still a student and dependent on her. She was born in Sauce, located in northern Nicaragua. In her free time, she likes to have fun with her family and cook a regional chicken stew. Sadly, she lacked the resources to go to college; therefore, she strives each day to offer her son a brighter future and professional training. \r\n\r\nShe wants to succeed and has been selling cosmetics and wood both as a street vendor and from her home. Previously, she made and sold tortillas. Her doctor advised her to give up this activity because she suffers rheumatism, and making tortillas required that she heat and wet her hands. She now works eight hours each day.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan as working capital to stock her business. Mar\u00eda Susana thanks Kiva lenders for offering low-income people in countries like Nicaragua a chance for decent work.

second largest city of Mongolia. Since 2010, she has been working at the train station. Her husband has been working for National Emergency Agency of Mongolia for six consecutive years. Their son goes to secondary school. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Using her previous loan, she has purchased furniture and made her house a comfortable living place. Now she is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, bricks, cements and metals. Using these materials, she wants to make an extension to her house and build a garage for her automobile. The house extension will stop the heat loss through the door and building a garage will protect their automobile from harsh winter storms. The automobile, which is frozen for long perciods during winter nights, tends to waste more fuel and release more carbon dioxide and chemicals harmful to clean air. So, making an extension and building a garage is essential for reducing fuel usage, emitting less smoke and then contributing to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for better future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1088.53,"image":{"id":1342688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Also, her husband raises livestock in the countryside during the summer time and she makes and sells dairy products at her grocery stall.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElizabeth runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Elizabeth's case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan to buy more used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from a \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, used bags and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of her capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nElizabeth dreams that she will have a better living and hopes that her business will continue to be successful.

Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and because she had to start working when she was very young, Rocio wasn't able to study nursing, but she would have liked doing so.

She works managing a jeepney transportation service. Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines.  They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known from their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating.  Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.  They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\nDolores previously received a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to buy spare parts and accessories and to maintain her jeepney. The earnings from her loan were a big help in her personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nDolores is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and maintain her jeepney. She will use the profits from her loan to help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. In the future, Dolores dreams of having another jeepney. She meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. Fellowship groups are composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She is married and the mother of three children. Manzura is a teacher by profession. Since her childhood she dreamt of becoming a teacher and worked hard towards this. Her dream came true and currently she works as a teacher at a rural school. Manzura loves her work very much and she loves her pupils like her children. \r\n\r\nHer husband is in Russia as a migrant worker, and every month, when it is possible, he sends financial support to his family. Before her husband traveled to the Russian federation he worked with livestock breeding. Currently Manzura continues this business herself. Her paid salary is not sufficient and therefore she tries to develop the livestock business. When her husband left, he taught her this activity, and she easily handles the business. Her eldest son helps her with this. At home they have several heads of livestock. They live in a rural area and have a plot of land where the livestock can graze. \r\n\r\nManzura turned to the organization Arvand for a loan, in order to increase the number of livestock. She plans to purchase one bull calf for the loan, and hopes for help and support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1337618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a bull","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manzura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":237.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":245.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":254.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":262.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":237.64,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":254.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971495},{"amount":171.53,"local_amount":762.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":816.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752019}],"funded_date":"2013-05-03T05:33:56Z","paid_date":"2013-07-19T09:03:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":554872,"name":"Kirinkai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kirinkai is a 51-year-old man.

He lives with his wife and child in a large traditional family in the Torakabougou neighborhood of the city of Bougouni.  Since he didn't go to school, he quickly got involved in income-generating activities, after spending a few years working as a shepherd alongside his father, in his village.\r\n\r\nHe then decided to buy and sell grocery products, a business he learned from his uncle.\r\n\r\nLooking for additional financial resources, Barou decided to join the loan program offered by Soro Yiriwaso.  This is his first loan, which he will use to buy five bags of sugar, six boxes of tea, eight boxes of cigarettes, eight boxes of soap, two boxes of powdered milk sachets and one box of candy.  He will resell all these goods in his shop.\r\n\r\nBarou stocks up in Bamako (capital city of the republic of Mali) and sometimes in Bougouni.  He buys his supplies from wholesalers and resells for cash and on credit to a retail customer base consisting of men and women.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Barou is expecting to make a monthly profit of 45,000 CFA francs, which will be used to repay his loan and to contribute to his family's

She would expand her business by adding some more space to her salon. Her clients are increasing day by day and current space is too congested so she would build one more room. She would also purchase some cosmetic products like lipsticks, facial scrubs, etc., and also some new hair stylers. This loan could help her to fulfil her dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1342814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty
