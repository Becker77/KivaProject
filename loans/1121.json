She lives in the small village of the Khelvachauri district with her son. \r\n\r\nEter has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have 0.3 hectare plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the harvested products locally.  It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEter requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Eter has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit, Eter will renovate a two-room flat for renting. After the flat is renovated, Eter will rent it out and increase the income of her family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She\u2019s from Lebanon and is 54 years old. She\u2019s divorced and living with her only parent and siblings. Ghada and her youngest brother are working really hard to provide the family with the needed income.

I'm studying for a Bachelor`s Degree in Management, specialising in Nature Conservation and Sustainable Living at the Maharishi Institute.\r\n\r\nI am the first born in a family of seven. I have three brothers, a little sister and both parents. I come from an underprivileged family. My brother finished high school last year, and doesn`t have funds to attend a college. My two little brothers and a sister are still at school. I love making music and in my free time, I read literature and write poetry.\r\n\r\nAfter my graduation in 2014, I want to run a sustainable eco-friendly business, focusing on eco-tourism and agricultural renewable energy. I would also like to teach kids and communities about human impact in the modern environment and sustainability.\r\n\r\nMy long-term goals are to work in environmental management, be a businessman in 5 -10 years, and lastly establish community projects focusing on economic growth and environmental

She and her husband have been farming their land for seven years and are currently growing a good variety of crops, including maize, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other vegetables. \r\n\r\nWhen asked if she was excited about starting to keep bees, Linet said that she was and that beekeeping is \"easy to manage\" and a \"good project.\" Linet plans to use the income generated from her hives to feed her family and to buy farming equipment, like jembes (hoes) and pangas (machetes). \r\n\r\nLinet's hope for the future is \"for me and my family to have a good life; that is, for my kids to have good jobs, enough food, and a good house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.1,"image":{"id":1342989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.283333 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":839,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726162},{"amount":14.05,"local_amount":1124,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1178.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595182788},{"amount":11.05,"local_amount":884,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":927.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611808191}],"funded_date":"2013-05-03T18:11:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":555002,"name":"Anass","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anass is 20 years old, a single man who lives in Taiz, Yemen.

It has one of the highest rural population densities in the world (in some areas, close to 600 people per square kilometer), which may contribute to the region's high poverty rates.\r\n\r\nLeavy is married, and has three children. Both him and his wife have been farming for seven years, and are currently growing maize, vegetables and sugar cane on their land.

lives outside of Kakamega town, in Kakamega county. Kakamega county is located in Western Kenya and is famous for having the only tropical rain forest in the country. Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping. \r\n\r\nOscar is married, and has three children. His wife currently works as a teacher, while he farms their land. He has been farming for five years, and is currently growing sugar cane and vegetables. Oscar is excited to work with Honey Care Africa, because he enjoys the free training sessions and the chance to learn about beekeeping. He also likes beekeeping, because it is a long term project and is not time-consuming. \r\n\r\nThis is Oscar's first loan, and he plans to use the income from his beehives to pay school fees for his children and renovate his house. When asked about his hopes and dreams for the future, Oscar said that he wants to \"see my kids through university so that they can get good jobs.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":21.3,"image":{"id":1342370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives for honey production.

This loan will thus benefit a group of very small entrepreneurs, among them Justina. She tells us that this is her first time working with Pro Mujer. She got to know the field partner thanks to a spokesperson, who came to visit her at her house.

She will use this loan to increase her working capital and buy rice, cooking oil, and pasta from the markets of El Alto. She will then prepare food to sell from her stall.

For the past 4 years she has run her small nutrition club which is located in her house. She makes delicious shakes and smoothies made with the flavor requested by the customer. With the first purchase of a shake she offers a small teacup as a gift so the customer can become familiar with the product and buy it on his next visit. She reports that her business has been doing very well. On this occasion she requests a loan in order to start a nutrition club at her parents' house which is located in Salinas Victoria. Thus she'll be able to support her parents in whatever they need, since they're seniors who can no longer work and need her help very much.

So Otgontsetseg is requesting a loan of 850,000 MNT to pay for her sister's tuition fee. After her sister's graduation from university, she can contribute to the family income generation. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1343486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

","en":"Safargul is a 48-year-old resident of Kulob and a married mother of six. She has three daughters and three sons. Her husband works abroad. Safargul's oldest daughter helps her mother with work and is learning to embroider. Two of Safargul's sons sell DVDs and SIM cards. Her other three children are in high school. \r\n\r\nFor 15 years Safargul has sewn and sold national dresses (chakan) and skullcaps. This craft has been passed down from generation to generation. Safargul learned to embroider from her mother. Now this craft is her profession and she is teaching her own daughter. \r\n\r\nSafargul is requesting a loan to purchase an electric sewing machine in order to make her sewing easier and to save time. This will give her more free time to embroider skullcaps, which are sewn by hand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1342268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Norida is a kind, cheerful, and helpful 42-year-old woman. She is married and has three wonderful children. Financial difficulties in her family prevented Norida from attending university after finishing high school. However, she completed a trade school for sewing. Since then she has worked as a seamstress from her home. She also teaches her daughters. \r\n\r\nAlthough this job brings her a steady income, Norida also works on a dekhan farm. Her husband also used to work with her on a dekhan farm, but the income was not enough to provide for their family comfortably. Hence, he decided to go to work in Russia just as many men from their village do. In Russia, he receives a regular salary that he sends to his wife. Norida's oldest son also works for the family. He is a carpenter, but his work is seasonal and therefore he does not always have an income. \r\n\r\nNorida and her family live in an old house that was passed down to her by her parents. Every year the condition of the house worsens. The weather, especially frequent rain and snow, effects the condition of the house. The roof is in need of a major renovation. All of the members of Norida's family tried to save money for a home renovation, but they simply could not manage to gather the necessary funds. Hence, Norida is requesting a loan, with which she will purchase the necessary materials for a major home renovation. She decided to turn to Arvand for financial assistance and hopes for a positive result.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1340132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

Irina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Irina will purchase car-painting equipment.

He lives in the village of Gora, Vani District, with his retired brother and sister and nephew. Pridon has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up without any success. His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main source of income for this family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows, a vineyard and a plot of land where nut trees and vegetables are grown. The cows are milked every day to make dairy products. Harvested vegetables and grapes are sold with the dairy products locally at the markets and the family earns a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nPridon requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Pridon has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Pridon will purchase all the needed materials to build a greenhouse. With the greenhouse, he will be able to sell vegetables not only in summer but wintertime too. This will significantly increase the family income. With the increased income, Pridon will be able to expand his agricultural business and improve the family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1343596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land where maize is grown. They sell harvested produce locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIoseb requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ioseb has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Ioseb and his wife will begin selling clothes.

He lives in Anaga village, Sighnagi district with his retired grandparents. Vano requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\nVano is a professional car painter. He is working on private orders and earns a small salary. The family receives additional income from Vano\u2019s grandparent\u2019s monthly pensions.\r\nVano requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Vano has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Vano will purchase four piglets.

He lives in Oni District with his children (25-year-old daughter Ekaterine and 20-year-old son Ivane). Guram requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGuram\u2019s wife is working abroad and she sends transfers to the family. His daughter Ekaterine is an administrator in a food production company in the capital city. Guram\u2019s son Ivane is an invalid and he gets monthly pension from the government. As Ivane needs special care, family monthly income is rarely enough to cover their food expenses.\r\n\r\nGuram requested a loan from Credo to re-start up the family business. Guram has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Guram will purchase liquid gas. He had this business before and still has the gas container so Guram wants\u2019 to start up the business again. He will be filling up the small gas cannisters (which are used for mainly for cooking) for his villagers who don\u2019t have piped gas systems in their houses. \r\n\r\nGuram is experienced in this business and he hopes he can make it successful and earn good profit.  Part of the profit will be reinvested in the same field to purchase more liquid gas and with another part he will provide better living conditions for his son. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1343609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To purchase liquid gas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Oni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-04T14:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-03T14:20:07Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guram ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":405.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":422.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":405.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":422.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":362.17,"local_amount":362.17,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":362.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749669},{"amount":382.27,"local_amount":382.27,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":382.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613574},{"amount":388.29,"local_amount":388.29,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":388.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857290},{"amount":396.34,"local_amount":396.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":396.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133942},{"amount":405.67,"local_amount":405.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":405.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107529},{"amount":412.96,"local_amount":412.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":412.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255076},{"amount":422.09,"local_amount":422.09,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":422.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019223},{"amount":430.21,"local_amount":430.21,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":430.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670362}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T22:08:44Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:08:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":555317,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is 46 years old and lives in  Paynesville which is one of the populated areas in Montserrado County.

She lives in a small village of Mtskheta District with husband Kakhaber and two children who go to school. Ia requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. They have a plot of land where different kinds of vegetables are grown for selling. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIa requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her loan Ia will pay for installation of electricity cables in their car workshop. The family owns a car workshop located near their house, but it is not in use. After they have electricity in their workshop, Kakhaber himself  will work and will get orders to repair cars. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She lives in Kutaisi district, West Georgia, with her retired mother. Marika requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMarika is working in a kindergarten as a dance teacher and her mother is working at a military base as a cook. Additional family income comes from their flower business. They have a flower shop in the center of the city.\r\n\r\nMarika requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Marika has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit Marika will purchase more flowers for her shop.

She lives in Matani village, Akhmeta district with her 25-year-old son, David. Asmat requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of the income for the family is David\u2019s salary. He is working at the local mail office and earns a small monthly salary.  \r\n\r\nAsmat requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Asmat has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

He lives alone in the village of Matani, Akhmeta District. Bakar has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up without any success. His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for Bakar is his monthly pension.\r\n\r\nBakar requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Bakar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nBakar will purchase grocery stock to open a grocery shop with his credit.

Julia is married and has 10 children. She is 50 years old. She alternates her daily duties with her livestock business. She makes yogurt and cheese with the milk her cows produce and then sells it to her customers. She has had this business for several years, and it is going well thanks to the hard work she puts into it every day. She is a responsible person with a lot of initiative, which is how she helps her family have a better life. She is requesting this loan so she can buy a dairy cow. The other members sell produce, grow crops, offer taxi services, raise livestock, and raise small barnyard animals. The member pictured in the smaller photograph requested permission to arrive at the meeting late because of his work responsibilities. Julia is grateful to everyone who has been part of this dream and is committed to making her payments on time and in full."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5700,"image":{"id":1343427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Anta-Kata\u00f1iray","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2013-05-04T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-03T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":5700,"lender_count":183,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Valentin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta Aquilina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rudencindo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Jesus Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Casiano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":15100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2281.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2371.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2465.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2563.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2665.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2753.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":861.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":895.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":930.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":967.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1006.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1039.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":861.06,"local_amount":2281.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2281.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372860338},{"amount":895.22,"local_amount":2371.56,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2372.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381628870},{"amount":930.73,"local_amount":2465.61,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2466.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390492594},{"amount":967.65,"local_amount":2563.41,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2564.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399740433},{"amount":839.47,"local_amount":2223.86,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2224.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410010725},{"amount":1205.87,"local_amount":3194.51,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3195.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419773773}],"funded_date":"2013-05-06T19:56:14Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T10:56:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":555374,"name":"Gerrin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gerrin, 49 years old and married, earns a living by selling seedling trees in the Philippines.

Nazgul works as a schoolteacher and, as an additional source of income for her family, also raises livestock, having launched this business 19 years ago with a starting capital of 6,000 KGS. Thanks to Nazgul\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes two heads of cattle with their young and 13 heads of small livestock; her revenues from milk sales are about 8,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop her business further, Nazgul applied to the \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS intended for adding a dairy cow to her livestock. Nazgul plans to invest the resulting revenues into a further growth of her business; her dream is to buy a car. \r\n. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1342850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-05-04T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-03T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3940},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3756},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3812},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3937},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4003},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4102},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4224},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4307},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4427},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4522},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4633},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4337}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.74},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":434.62,"local_amount":20696,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":20936.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863117},{"amount":53.38,"local_amount":2541.72,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-02T09:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2571.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631651},{"amount":562,"local_amount":26762.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":27072.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495555}],"funded_date":"2013-05-05T18:58:43Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T09:39:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":555200,"name":"Jeny Zorayda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jeny Zorayda de 48 a\u00f1os de edad, casada con dos hijos de 21, 15 a\u00f1os los cuales est\u00e1n estudiando.

dependent children. He struggles to earn a living through raising pigs, growing rice on a half-hectare of land, and growing cassava on one hectare of land. Moy has been in this business since he was 20 years old. \r\n\r\nMoy's previous loan was his first loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), and he has fully repaid it. The past loan supported his income-generating activities seasonably to pay for a transplanting fee for his rice crop and weeding for his cassava plantation.

This way of working allows her to generate resources to maintain her household as much as possible as she lives in a partnership and she has a daughter.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says that she likes the training in health and credit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":1344264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy notebooks, geometry sets, pens, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-05-05T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-04T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":4025,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erica\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yola Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nehidi\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhoselin Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27777.76,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3611.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4027.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":523.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":523.26,"local_amount":3611.16,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3615.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021449},{"amount":583.62,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809257},{"amount":583.63,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669327},{"amount":583.63,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915086},{"amount":583.63,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197717},{"amount":583.62,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153468},{"amount":583.61,"local_amount":4027.65,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615064}],"funded_date":"2013-05-09T14:24:08Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:42:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":555430,"name":"Samith's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samith is 54 years old and married.

Her husband is temporarily residing in another district, working on a construction site.\r\n\r\nHer elder son has become employed as a salesman by a business entity, but the employer requires him to have an automobile, to be used for transporting products and meeting with potential clients. So Myagmarsuren is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT. She will use it to purchase an automobile that runs on natural gas. This natural gas car has cleaner emissions, with lower carbon and particulate emissions per equivalent distance traveled, and less fuel wastage. Purchasing this car will enable her son to secure his employment. It will also contribute to the efforts against air pollution, by emitting fewer harmful chemicals into the air.\r\n\r\nThe borrower is a very hardworking individual, who has a vast amount of
