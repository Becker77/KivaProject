The cell phone companies sell their cards and credit to individuals who then sell them to the public. Olivia's business strategy is to sell individual items as well as to sell credit in bulk. Her stand is located on a busy avenue on which many people travel. \r\n\r\nThis is Olivia's first loan from HOPE Congo.

Using these materials, they can repair and insulate their house, thus providing comfortable and warm accommodations for the family.

He lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, with his 35-year-old wife and their two children who are going to school. Artur requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the monthly salary of Artur\u2019s wife. She is working at the beauty salon as an administrator. The family's total income is so small that they rarely can cover their monthly expenses. \r\n\r\nArtur requested a loan from Credo to start up his family business. Artur has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

To prepare her porridge, she first gets her maize and soaks it in water to soften it for three days. On the third day, she washes the maize and sends it to the mill to be milled. She then makes a mixture of dough out of the milled wet corn and leaves it for a day. She mixes the dough with water to get a porridge-like consistency and cooks it by stirring continuously to prevent it from forming lumps. The porridge only has to cook for a couple of minutes and then it is ready to be served. Corn porridge goes with bread of any kind and fried doughnuts.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Razhden will purchase a mini-bus.

","en":"Egam is an elderly but active man of the age of 50 years. He is married and has six children. In his youth he received education in carpentry and for a long time he worked as a carpenter. But when he got a family and children, this type of work became very difficult for him, as the work was a physical exertion for him. \r\n\r\nAfter some time, Egam and his wife started their own business, which does not require hard physical work and brings a good and stable income. To this day Egam works with fattening cattle. He has a small plot of land next to his home. Currently Egam has four sheep and goats. He not only raises and sells livestock, but also sells milk from it. Every morning his wife and children sell 10 liters of milk to the neighbors and other customers. \r\n\r\nEgam's eldest son is in Russia as a migrant worker and every month, when possible, he sends financial support to his parents. Egam wants his children to have a good income and not be in need of anything. He would like to expand his business, in order to receive a larger income. Therefore he would like to get a loan from Arvand, to increase the number of livestock and the size of his income. After that he would like to expand his business and increase the quality of life for his

Gabil purchases products from the villagers and brings it to the main market in Marneuli district, where all the products are sold with a price mark up. \r\n\r\nGabil requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Gabil has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Gabil will purchase a mini-bus. He wants to expand his trading business. With the mini-bus, Gabil will be able to purchase more products to sell. This will significantly increase his profit. Part of the profit he will be reinvested in the same field to purchase more fruits and vegetables and another part will be used for his family's well being.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

As a source of income for his family, Usenbai works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business with 15,000 som (KGS).

Through a great deal of sacrifice he has been able to get his own means of transportation, a truck with a loudspeaker, to carry the materials people sell him.

But he decided to support his wife and start working with her full-time, and with their children they have made this into a family business.  They travel to the different departments (regions) outside their city, looking for new customers and getting people acquainted with their products.  \r\n\r\nMario is requesting a loan to buy fabric at wholesale.  In this way, he hopes to get his raw materials at a better price so that he can produce more.  In the future, he wants to work with electric machines to put a better finish on his bed nets."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1344437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-05-05T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-04T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario Jose \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":204.69,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":22.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":22.74,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373166179},{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":22.74,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":24.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381972000},{"amount":25,"local_amount":22.74,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837364},{"amount":25,"local_amount":22.74,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860648},{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":22.74,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":24.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349354},{"amount":25,"local_amount":22.74,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901468},{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":22.74,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":24.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550603},{"amount":25.14,"local_amount":22.87,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440022054},{"amount":24.89,"local_amount":22.64,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":24.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673923}],"funded_date":"2013-05-06T03:19:49Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":555819,"name":"Rosa Adriana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa, de oficio  comerciante, es due\u00f1a de una pulper\u00eda.

and has 2 children.  She works with livestock and in agriculture as the sole source of income for her family, having started her business 21 years ago with 20,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, Urtagy today owns 3 cows with offspring, 10 goats and 5 sheep.  Her monthly income from the sale of milk products is around 7,000 KGS.

She started up this business on her own initiative, having learned to make these items from her parents when she was a child.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is taking now will be used to increase her working capital (to buy alpaca wool from the traditional markets in the city of El Alto) so that she can later sell the finished goods in her retail space.  This work will enable her to generate resources to support her household as best she can, because she is single and has a child.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answered that she likes the savings accounts, the services, and the loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1344800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy alpaca wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-05-05T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-04T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petrona Rudy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vasilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhenny Jhannet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Demetrio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhanneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26464.63,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3341.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3302.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":486.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":480.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":480.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":480.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":486.08,"local_amount":3341.27,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3358.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021455},{"amount":480.58,"local_amount":3303.49,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809265},{"amount":480.58,"local_amount":3303.49,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669335},{"amount":480.59,"local_amount":3303.49,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915094},{"amount":480.58,"local_amount":3303.49,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197725},{"amount":961.16,"local_amount":6606.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6641.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153475},{"amount":480.43,"local_amount":3302.42,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3319.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615070}],"funded_date":"2013-05-06T23:27:22Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":555671,"name":"Manwa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manwa is the featured borrower of Manwa's Group.

It is made up of six members and is directed by a board, of which Ver\u00f3nica is the president. \r\n\r\nThe businesses that the members of the communal bank have are various. Among them are: sewing aprons, knitting and sales of blankets, french fry and cracker sales, rug braiding, fruit sales, and food sales. \r\n\r\nThe loan they are getting out will benefit a group of small microentrepreneurs of which Ver\u00f3nica is a member.

She began this business on her own initiative with little capital, and she currently wishes to expand it.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out is for a capital increase for fruit purchase. She will acquire the fruit in the fairs in the city of El Alto and will subsequently sell it in her retail space.

","en":"Holniso is a joyful, optimistic woman, and a caring wife and mother to two children. She stood out from her peers even in school for her enterprising nature and drive to achieve her goals. After finishing high school she was unable to enroll in a university because her parents decided to marry her off. At first Holniso lived off of her husband, but when children came her husband's income became insufficient for the family. She decided to start her own business, by renting a store in the center of the clothing market and importing women's clothing to sell. Today, 13 years later, she is still in the business. She has won many loyal customers who consider her an organized and responsible woman. The business has earned her a good income, which she spends on her children's education. Her husband works as a laborer in Russia and sends money home each month. Now Holniso wants to make a large purchase of summer clothing to match the season and improve her sales. To do that, Holniso came to Arvand for a loan to buy summer clothing for future sale. She thanks you for your support in advance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1340972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy summer season women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-06T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-05T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Holniso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":699.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":721.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":743.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":766.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":789.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":814.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":839.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":865.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":892.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":919.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":948.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1900,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":9038.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752021}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T01:25:03Z","paid_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":555693,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is a 28-year-old married man.

The loan will help these small businesses, including Amalia's. This is her first experience with Pro Mujer, joining after one of the institution's promoters invited her after visiting her home. Amalia currently has a business selling cosmetics, which she started on her own after learning the trade from her friend. She plans to use the loan to increase her capital to purchase cosmetics from wholesale distributors, and she will then sell the products from her sales space. In this way she will generate revenue to provide for her household as much as possible, since she is a single mother with one son.

She lives in Kutaisi district, West Georgia with her 49 year old husband, 20 year old son and daughter in-law.  Nana requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNana\u2019s husband is an artisan. He works on house renovations for private orders and earns a small monthly income. This is the only source of living for the family, which is rarely enough to cover their monthly expenses. \r\n\r\nNana requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Nana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit Nana will purchase calves. She wants to raise them and in the future sell them at a good price at the local markets. Nana\u2019s new business will bring her a good profit. Part of the profit she will reinvest in the same field, in order to develop her farming and another part she will use for improving the family's living conditions.

He has 50 years of experience working with livestock.  When he started his business, he had one sheep that he looked after.  Kuzimat himself says, \"I took very good care of my only sheep.  Dozens of heads of livestock were only a dream then.  Now it is a reality, it's my income and livelihood.\"  With time, he became more clever in the industry.  At the beginning, it was difficult for him, especially during the winter when the land was covered in snow and it cost him much to feed his animals.  But through the years, Kuzimat has proven himself and has come to find solutions to the obstacles he faces which help him move forward.  Today he has more than 10 head of cattle and 10 other animals.  His wife and three children are also involved in the business--his wife milks the cows.  The money earned from selling milk, yogurt and cottage cheese is used to pay for everyday expenses.  Because of the season, Kuzimat is unable to sell his sheep and cows, or buy feed since prices have fallen.  He needs additional funds for feed and to buy new animals.  With this goal, he turned to Arvand for a loan.  He believes the loan will allow him to eliminate his financial difficulties.  He is grateful to Arvand for the assistance and huge role it plays in his life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1343005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

It is composed of women stemming from the same village, who are now on their second loan, and have learned new practices related to saving and solidarity. They are all involved in small commercial activities. Mrs Fatoumata (seen in a special image located on the top right of the photo) is the star lender in the group. She is 53 year old, married, a mother of eight children, including two boys. She is involved in the sale of palm oil and rice, that she purchases in the local markets and resells in her village to individual customers. This new loan will allow her to purchase two bags of rice for 15 000 FCFA, a box of teas, and a 20 liter container of palp oil for 15 000 FCFA. She plans to use the profits from these sales to support her husband in taking care of their children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3975,"image":{"id":1344758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase bags of rice, a box of teas, and a 20 liter container of palm oil ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2013-05-06T14:10:48Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-05T14:10:48Z","loan_amount":3975,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou Alpha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata Mahamadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dado","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama Maoudo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna Hassane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nendio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Biri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tening","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Souba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata Idy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asmaou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Demmo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ansata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa Secou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama Saliou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dado","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadidiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tacko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maroum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata Thierno","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama Diaraye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba Amadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kagou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1980000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1980000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3975,"local_amount":1980000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1986734.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419823958}],"funded_date":"2013-05-12T13:42:09Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T13:07:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chlo\u00e9 Tuot","image":1210498}},{"id":555847,"name":"Khursheedan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Khursheedan is a 54-year-old housewife.

She is married to Eddie, a carpenter, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAmy operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nAmy hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams that all her children will have a job.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan with her family. From the past 19 years her husband has been running a paint shop in the market. He is the only income-earner in the family and this shop is the only source of income for his family. His monthly net income is inadequate to meet the household needs so he is planning to grow his business by purchasing more products for the shop. This will help him to increase his monthly net income and savings. However, due to the lack of finance he finds it difficult.\r\n\r\nMs. Riffat wants to help her husband to cover the cost of purchasing paint in different colours and a variety of paint brushes. Therefore she has requested a loan amount of 25,000 PKR from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. She is hopeful that the loan will be a productive one for her husband's business. She is thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

They are working hand-in-hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHelen owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) of jeepney, which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 17,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and to pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nHelen hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life.  Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn money and modified the jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Filipino.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
