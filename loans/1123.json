I am a very responsible, hard working person, friendly person. I like sports and reading. I like to get ahead,  own my things and grow as a baker. I started my bakery 12 years ago, after finishing a technical degree in accounting. Since I was 15 years old, I worked as a \"chalan\" (low level assistant) in a bakery. Slowly but surely I began saving some money, then I bought some fixed assets: machines and an oven and all the required utensils for the bakery.

","en":"Ilyos is a kind and honest man who is 47 years old.  He is married and has 5 children.  His wife is a homemaker who raises the children who don't yet have their own families.  Since his childhood, Ilyos has worked fattening cattle and knows all the advantages of the industry.  His older children help him with the work.  Additionally, they have a small farm, but the income from it is very small.  Therefore, Ilyos is trying to expand his business fattening cattle.  Every two weeks, he takes his fattened cattle to a market and sells them at a premium.  He then immediately buys new, young cows.  He very much likes this part of his work since he loves animals.  Every day, Ilyos' son takes the animals to a pasture not far from their home.  He bought his son a horse which makes his son's job a bit easier since he had to do it on foot before.  Ilyos plans to marry off his oldest son who is already grown this year.  For this, he should save money to be able to provide worthy wedding celebrations.  He has turned to Arvand to take out a loan to increase his number of cattle.  Ilyos hopes that Arvand will help him and that with this loan, he will be able to buy a few head of cattle and save the needed amount for his son's celebration."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1339431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-06T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-05T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ilyos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":315.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":322.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":329.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":336.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":343.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":353.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":315.2,"local_amount":315.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":315.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550101},{"amount":322.1,"local_amount":322.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":322.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774326},{"amount":329.16,"local_amount":329.16,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":329.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673459},{"amount":1033.54,"local_amount":1033.54,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144255}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T15:41:41Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Blake Griffin","image":1939381}},{"id":555932,"name":"Rogelio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rogelio is 26 years old and single.

Since 2008, Mwera has been running a chicken project where he grows them and, later on after growing, sells them to the hotels and other customers. He is doing fine in his project.This project enables him to obtain his family's basic needs.  He works from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily and is able to make a fair profit per month. \r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania, which he will use to buy more chicks (about 500) to reach more customers.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PhP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nJesusa lives in Taguig, Philippines, with her husband Hamid and their children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. They are both working to provide income for the family's everyday needs.\r\n\r\nJesusa is requesting a PhP25,000 loan in order to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nJesusa dreams of adding another source of income for the family.

He is a carpenter and has been making a variety of types of furniture since 1989. He works from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily and is able to make a good profit each month. \r\n\r\nJoktan is in his early forties. He and his wife have four children, all of whom are enrolled in school.\r\n\r\nThis will be Joktan's tenth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. With the previous loans, all of which he has repaid successfully, he has bought larger quantities of wood and has made larger quantities of furniture, which he has then been able to sell to more clients.

His biggest challenges are pests and disease control.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Juhudi Kilimo is very efficient.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, and he answered, 'How to develop a savings culture.'\r\n \r\nGeoffrey's highest monthly expense is school fees for his children. When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Geoffrey replied, 'It will give them a better quality of life.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Geoffrey owns a 'cow and poultry' but does not own 'a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower tells us that his household has 'a mosquito net and electricity' but does not have 'solar power, running water, a sewing machine, a TV, or a DVD player.'\r\n \r\nNote: To create this

The main items she sells are palm oil, salt and seasonings, and she works 12 hours a day, seven days a week. The main challenges she faces are a low income and the high cost of transportation. She is requesting a loan to buy more items to sell, and will use the additional income she earns to put money aside for her old age and to renovate her house.

For the past year, she has been running a caf\u00e9 where she sells water, soft drinks, and some kinds of food. Halima works from seven in the morning through 10 at night and is able to make a good monthly profit. She is doing fine. Halima has requested 12 previous loans through Tujijenge Tanzania. She used her previous loans to replace stock in her cafe such as cartons of drinking water.

Before starting this milk production business, Kosar's family often lived in hand-to-mouth conditions. So she decided to support her family to provide a better and more secure future for her children. Now she has two buffaloes and one cow in milk; she sells its milk to many people in her community. Her customers are very satisfied and regard her for her honest behavior. In order to increase her sales, Kosar needs to purchase another buffalo so she requested a loan of Rs. 40,000 from Kashf Foundation. She is in her fourth loan cycle with a good repayment history. She wishes to spend part of her profit on the expansion of her business.

The eldest, a daughter, works at a military center in the area, two of her other children work where she lives, and her other daughter works as a chef. \r\n\r\nMaria has made a living by planting vegetables (potatoes, broccoli, and cauliflower) for more than 25 years. She learnt how to do this from her husband, to whom she is grateful for the enormous effort with which he worked up until his last day of life. Her produce is sold through intermediaries who come to the area for its great reputation for quality, hygiene, and work methods, but as with all crops there are still risks, such as plagues and price variation in the market.\r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting help in order to invest in planting potatoes through purchasing certified seed, since it is safer, more hygienic, and cleaner. By doing this, she will be able to increase her crops and obtain a better profit from her crops.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to buy a plot of land in order to build a home for her children and to cultivate a greater variety of produce to offer to her customers, since in this way she will be able to increase her revenue and help her children with their studies so they can graduate at university level.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1344984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase certified potato seeds so she can plant her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-05-07T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-06T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":1.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381922845},{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":0.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390787324},{"amount":350.18,"local_amount":6670.04,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6733.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399793665},{"amount":0.04,"local_amount":0.76,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":0.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070254},{"amount":0.25,"local_amount":4.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833693},{"amount":0.07,"local_amount":1.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042165},{"amount":350.14,"local_amount":6669.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6733.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710457},{"amount":0.19,"local_amount":3.59,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449616481},{"amount":0.04,"local_amount":0.79,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":0.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082593},{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.55,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":0.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895390},{"amount":348.95,"local_amount":6646.73,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6710.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118044}],"funded_date":"2013-05-07T11:13:14Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T10:40:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Minogue","image":null}},{"id":556001,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the photo above is Samuel, a staff member at one of the sugar-producing companies in Sierra Leone.

She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation and lack of enough capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nShe requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone to buy more onions, mayonnaise, ketchup and cooking oil for food preparation. She says that the extra income from this loan will help her pay fees for her children and increase her business. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to open a big restaurant. She is grateful for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1344784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict

La tierra que ella y su pareja trabajan esta a una distancia de 16 kil\u00f3metros a la cual se trasladan diariamente para su debido control y mantenimiento como lo es: Limpieza, poda, fertilizaci\u00f3n y abono al mismo.\n\nActualmente Virgilia solicita ayuda para poder comprar abono y fertilizantes para sus cultivos de papa ya que de esta forma ella mantendr\u00e1 sano y salvo de plagas y bichos sus cultivos.\n\nSus planes son de poder ampliar sus tierra para poder cultivar mas producto y arreglar su casa de habitaci\u00f3n para que sus hijos puedan vivir en mejores condiciones y mas c\u00f3modos. Sus sue\u00f1os son que sus hijos se preparen a nivel universitario para que sean hombres y mujeres de provecho.","en":"Virgilia is a 39-year-old married woman with 3 children, of whom two are minors and the eldest is at primary school.  She, herself, in spite of only having been educated to fifth grade at primary school, is a fighter.  It was her parents who taught her how to work the land (growing vegetables) when she was still very young.  She very much enjoys her work, having taken a liking to it at an early age, and is pleased with the experience she has gained.  She does not, however, only work in agriculture; she also sells her produce (in particular the coffee which grows in abundance and safety throughout the region where the land and atmosphere are ideal for growing crops).  She sells her produce through intermediaries who visit the region, as well as to neighbours and to others at the trading area which they travel to.  The land which she and her partner farm is 16 kilometres away, which means a daily journey to carry out the necessary checks and maintenance tasks such as: cleaning, pruning and applying fertiliser and manure.  Virgilia is seeking this loan to buy manure and fertiliser to protect her potato crops from pests and bugs.  She plans to extend the land she farms so as to boost production and to make improvements to her home to provide better and more comfortable living conditions for her children.  Her ambition is to see her children receive a university education which will enable them to become successful men and women.

This is 40-year-old Delarah from Jui, which is in the eastern area of Freetown. She is married with four children between the ages of 10 and 20. Three of her children are attending school. \r\n\r\nDelarah runs a store with food items; she sells pure water and soft drinks. She has been running this business for 15 years, and she works at the business throughout the week and 11 hours each day.  She describes her major problems as insufficient capital to run her business and lack of electricity supply within the community.\r\n\r\nDelarah has requested a loan in order to buy more pure water and soft drinks to sell. The extra income from this loan will allow her to take care of her family and pay her children's school fees. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to open a bar and restaurant. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1344825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The farm products at the end of the harvest are then shared with the Zamindars (the farm owners), which always leaves her family with a very small income and harvest. \r\n\r\nJangmei refers to Hannah Group as a life saver because after she joined the group, she could avail loans from WSDS. She bought piglets and also constructed a pig sty at the back of her house to raise them. Now, she can raise pigs as well as continue her vegetable plantations, which eventually will increase her income. \r\n\r\nShe plants vegetables according to seasonal changes and keeps herself busy throughout the year. She sells vegetables to women vegetable vendors and her main supply is chives. She says her main income is generated after selling chives because it can be grown throughout the year. \r\n\r\nAfter she joined the group, she could send her children to boarding schools. She could pay the school expenses after she sold her fully grown pigs. She is happy to share this and says her life has made a different turn too.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase two more piglets and raise them.

She joined Sutkim Group in the year 2009. She is pictured with hand raised and she is the featured borrower.\r\n\r\nVeijahat rents a place in the town market shed and she sells various dried fish, dried-chilly and seasonal vegetables too. This includes seeds of pea, mustard, beans, cabbage, lady fingers, brinjals, pumpkin. She also takes advantage of seasonal plantation and sells vegetable seeds and saplings. She makes good money during the plantation season because almost the entire region is engaged in farming and people throng in the town market looking for different vegetable seeds and saplings. She also grows vegetables at the back of her house and sells them too. With the small profits she makes, she pays her monthly loan repayment, pays the house rent and also does household maintenance.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of the Kiva loan, Veijahat is planning to purchase Kharif (summer) seeds and saplings. She will get the supplies from the city and sell them in the town market. She believes these will be useful for the villagers who can avoid spending extra for fares to get to the city to purchase the seeds. Veijahat says that after she received the loan from WSDS, she could manage the household expenses and save her husband\u2019s salary for the children's education. She adds that her youngest son is pursuing his M.Phil in the capital city and one of her daughters is undergoing nursing training. \u201cThese are my accomplishments as a mother\u201d says Veijahat.\r\n\t\t\r\nShe thanks Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful support shown upon her and the rest of the group members and is glad to be a part of the team and feels blessed. She also wishes a grand achievement for their future. She says \u201cthank you, Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe remaining group members are also very active and hardworking in their businesses.

She has never had any formal education. Mather is engaged in palm oil production at Likpe Bakua, Hohoe, as she has done for a year. To prepare palm oil, she washes the palm fruits and boils them until they become soft and tender. She scoops the cooked fruit into a big mortar and gently pounds it with a pestle to avoid damaging the nut. Water is then added to the pounded fruit. The mixture of water and the pounded fruit is squeezed and filtered to get the juice out and remove the chaff. The chaff is sometimes used by the local people to light charcoal fires. The juice is boiled again and, as it boils, the fresh oil floats to the surface of the pot. The oil is scooped into yet another pot and left to cool.

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her four children. She loves her family and claims they are her greatest strength for getting up each morning and working hard to generate an income. \r\n\r\nSince 2004, she has been working as a tailor. She provides stitching services in her community. Her eldest daughter also helps her in stitching up dresses. She has excellent stitching skills, and due to the money she generates, she has managed to provide a better quality of life for her family. \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to expand her business and to purchase one more sewing machine, as her number of customers is increasing day by day. However, because of having only one machine, she cannot easily cope up with all the customers on time and that results in a loss of money and customers. Therefore, she is asking for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to invest in the purchase of a sewing machine, which will allow her to fulfill the demands of customers more efficiently and to elevate her level of income. \r\n\r\nWith the profit amount, she wishes to start a general store business in her home to sell a variety of products, including biscuits, tea packs, rice, etc. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Though most farmers in the area are new to beekeeping, many are very enthusiastic about keeping bees. \r\n\r\nKusema has been farming for six years and is currently growing eucalyptus trees. He is excited to work with Honey Care Africa because he enjoys the training sessions and the chance to learn about beekeeping and he is happy to start beekeeping because it is a good source of income. \r\n\r\nThis is Kusema's first loan and he plans to use the income generated by his hives to start more tree plantations. Kusema is working very hard these days and for good reason: when asked about his hopes and dreams for the future, he said he intends to \"raise funds to pay the dowry, so I can marry my girlfriend.\"   "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":12,"image":{"id":1345176,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kwale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-05-07T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-06T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kusema","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589352}],"funded_date":"2013-05-07T20:07:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":556188,"name":"Marjorie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marjorie is a 30-year-old married woman and the mother of four children.

He has been farming for eight years, and is currently growing passion fruit on his land.

During summertime, his wife sells dairy products and meat to local people. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair and extension since his sons are growing and requiring more private space. So, Badamdorj is requesting a loan of MNT 6,000,000 to purchase building and insulation materials, such as bricks, concrete, planks, fiberglass, foam, and gypsum walls. \r\n\r\nUsing these materials, he can make his house more comfortable and a warmer place. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and contribute to the efforts against air pollution. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is one of our reliable clients.

He has three additional dependents at home. He is very hardworking and wants to educate his children. He's been in this business for 8 years, selling movies discs and tapes and phone accessories. He describes his major problem as the absence of electric power supply in the Waterloo community. He applied for this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone to buy a generator, music discs and phone accessories. He says the extra income from this loan will help him have a permanent business location and start a savings account.

","en":"Nazira is a 43 year-old woman.  She is married and has three children.  Nazira is involved in animal husbandry and farming.  She primarily grown potatoes at a dekhan farm.  Her primary income, however, comes from animal husbandry.  Nazira's son helps her with the animal husbandry business.  Additional income comes from her husband, who works in Russia and sends as much money as possible to the family every month.  Nazira wants to build a new house for her son, but the money she saved is not enough.  She learned about the Arvand organization from her friends and decided to make a request.  Nazira plans to use this loan to begin building the house and buy construction materials.  She thanks Arvand in advance for the support and

She purchases clothes from different areas and sells them in the main market at a profitable amount. \r\n\r\nNaheed is a responsible mother of five children. Her husband makes his living as a daily worker, and his income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family members. She faced many problems in her early married life; there were days when her children often slept without having had any food. But now her contribution to the family income is playing a vital role in fulfilling the needs of the family members. \r\n\r\nTo cope with the increasing demand during the summer season, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase a variety of clothes in different colors. She hopes to get an increase in her net income and wishes to spend part of the profits on the improvement of her house. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

The money from this loan is very important to her because it will enable her to buy the ingredients she needs to prepare her food.  In addition to her food business, Priscila also sews.
