In her free time, she enjoys having fun with her family doing activities such as cooking a regional dish of the region such as \u201cIndio Viejo\u201d, a soup with vegetables and corn. Unfortunately, because of a lack of money she could not go to university, but she would have liked to study social work.\r\nThanks to her spirit and desire to succeed she has a grocery store located in her home.

She has three dependent children, two of whom are still in school. The main source of her family\u2019s income is from corn and rice cultivation. To supplement the income, her husband works for others for a fee. Having been in the farming business for 10 years, she is able to earn daily income of KHR 27,600 to support her family, and she can save about KHR 10,000 per day for future needs.\r\n\r\nVutna\u2019s Group consists of two members who live in the same village.

Salamatu says that the main challenge to her business is that sometimes if the food did not sell, she will run at a loss.\r\n\r\nSalamatu has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items, like palm oil and cooking seasoning. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and renovate her house. In the future, she plans to build a house. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1346024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy more cooking items, like palm oil and cooking seasoning.

The more items displayed at the store the better, as more items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nNeriza hopes that her business will continue to be successful.

Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, near Tanzania. Inconsistent rains, especially recently, have made farming difficult, and the poverty rates in the county are above the Kenyan average. \r\n\r\nBeekeeping is somewhat new to Kwale, but the passion fruit farms and mangrove forests throughout the area provide excellent sources of nectar for bee colonies. Many farmers in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.  \r\n\r\nKhalfan is married and has six children. Both he and his wife are farmers and are currently growing mangoes on their land. He is looking forward to beekeeping because he loves to eat honey and he is excited to start working with Honey Care Africa because their hive technicians give good service on beehives. \r\n\r\nThis is Khalfan's first loan and he plans to use the income generated from his beehives to help make some improvements to his house. In the future, Khalfan hopes to save up enough money to start a tree plantation on his land.

She is going to use the loan proceeds to buy more merchandise to supply her store and for savings to be able to open another store as this is her dream so she can expand and grow with her business, also expanding to the city of La Paz."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1346365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for the change of seasons","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2013-05-08T22:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-07T22:30:05Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":256.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":493.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":493.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":541.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":558.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":572.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":609.81},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":629.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":656.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":688.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.28,"local_amount":256.28,"processed_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":257.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381696884},{"amount":71.73,"local_amount":493.14,"processed_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":495.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390559610},{"amount":71.84,"local_amount":493.9,"processed_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":496.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399808602},{"amount":78.7,"local_amount":541.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":543.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410084613},{"amount":81.18,"local_amount":558.07,"processed_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":560.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419851137},{"amount":83.32,"local_amount":572.85,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":575.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430395198},{"amount":88.7,"local_amount":609.81,"processed_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":612.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439724907},{"amount":91.53,"local_amount":629.26,"processed_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":632.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449631195},{"amount":95.55,"local_amount":656.89,"processed_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":660.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459097911},{"amount":100.17,"local_amount":688.69,"processed_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":692.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467912943}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T15:47:43Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T12:11:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":551577,"name":"Adelfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of three children, Adelfa works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a food production business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from a general store.

He currently works as a salaried driver and his wife also helps by doing the housework and looking after the children.  They work seven days a week, both of them contributing to the cost of paying the bills, buying food and clothing and educating their children.  He needs the loan to maintain and repair the car he drives, as this is his only source of income.  The roads and routes he covers are full of dirt and dust and the vehicle's owner told Willson that if he wants to continue working, he has to take responsibility for the car's maintenance costs.

She also is a professional speaker who shares her inspiring story at schools, universities, correctional facilities, law enforcement conferences and other venues. \n\nShe currently produces an online talk show, \"Living True and Truly Living: Real People ... Real Stories ... Real Issues,\u201d spotlighting people who have overcome obstacles and found joy in life once again. She hopes to eventually bring this program to broadcast television.\n\nShe also has a new project in the planning stages - a film, \"Annihilator of Innocence: The Barbara Clark Story,\" based on her book.  \n\nTahiera successfully applied for a Promesa loan from Accion Alabama, an extension of Accion Texas Inc., to produce the summer episodes of her talk show. The funds will pay for a director, production crew and for promotional merchandise to market the show.\n\n\u201cI am so grateful to Accion for helping me expand my platform and reach more people who need encouragement and hope,\u201d Tahiera says. She adds that Accion\u2019s belief in her will serve as an example to potential sponsors as she grows her talk show and film projects. \u201cIf other people see that Accion invested in me, then that can jumpstart interest among possible investors,\u201d she says.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":1339582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Film","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

He is 50 years old and has been in a common-law relationship with Sra. Susana for many years.  They have a family that includes four children, all of whom are studying.  \r\n\r\nDon Bruno has a taxi that he offers as public transportation.  He started this business 10 years ago because he did not have a steady job.  There were many occasions in which his income was unpredictable, so he decided to provide public transportation services so that he could live without any financial worries.  Don Bruno says, \u201cWhen I started my business, it was very difficult because my first vehicle did not have license plates, so I always had to be careful to not get caught by the police.  They could confiscate my car since I had no papers to show them.\u201d   Nonetheless, his taxi was finally impounded and it took him three months to recover his vehicle.  He also had to pay a fine to the authorities.  \r\n\r\nThis situation led Don Bruno to form a group and seek support from a formal company.  The negotiations took four years before he finally received his concessions and license plates for his taxis.  Don Bruno currently has one taxi that he uses every day for his work, but he also has additional vehicles that he makes available for rent.  This time Sr. Bruno is requesting a loan so that he can buy tires and pay for the maintenance of his vehicle.  The loan will help him improve his services.

She is 34 years old. She is married and raising four children. Gulsara always does all she can to ensure  good life conditions and   a good education for her children. Gulsara plans to launch a new business and earn an income, since the income of her husband, Olimjon, is not enough to provide for the family needs. Gulsara has completed the \u201cGet Ahead\u201d training course organized by the Association of Business Women and earned a certificate.

Fatmata's main business challenges are the cost of transportation and the poor roads within her operation area. Fatmata has requested a loan in order to buy bags of cola nuts. The extra income from this loan will allow her to buy new products such as palm oil and gari. In the future, she plans to buy a generator to light her house.

She is married with two children between the ages of one and six years old. One of her children is currently attending school. In 2000, Lulu established her home product business. She began her business because she needed to get income to support the home.  Her husband is a fisherman but his income is not enough to take care of the home. She works at the business 12 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is breakage of the bowls.   .\r\n\r\nLulu requires a loan in order to purchase more rubber spoons, pots, baskets and food containers. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and have a permanent business location. In the future, Lulu plans to expand her business to a shop level. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1346194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

These customers have gradually been referring others to her, which has increased her business.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she is applying for a Kiva loan, which is her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With the loan, she will buy fabric, thread, buttons, zippers, and other sewing supplies. With these supplies, Kathlyn plans to design new pieces of clothing and increase her inventory so she can sell more. Her primary goal is to have her own house. For this reason, she works every day making sales via both cash and credit. She hopes to generate more income and achieve her dreams of success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1346483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, thread, buttons, zippers, and other sewing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-05-09T02:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-08T02:00:21Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kathlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":76213},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82269},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84188},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86153},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88163},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90220},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":92325},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94479},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96684},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":98940},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101248},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":109118}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":76213,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":76384.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928767},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":82269,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":82453.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705937},{"amount":513.56,"local_amount":941376,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":943492.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968226}],"funded_date":"2013-05-12T01:38:48Z","paid_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Polenske","image":1311923}},{"id":556657,"name":"William","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"William is a resident of Mbarara municipality.

She is pictured with her hand raised and she is the featured borrower for the \"Phanem\" Group. After the death of her brother-in-law, she and her husband looked after the four kids her brother-in-law had left behind. She and her husband feed eight kids, which is inclusive of their kids and the bereaved brother-in-law's kids. She also says surviving without a regular income is the toughest part because her husband is a lorry driver. In case of bandh in the state or a blockade on the two National Highways, the family income depreciates. To supplement the family income, she started a small Pan-Corner in the town market, which is located near the Town Bus stand.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of her business, she sold only paan and cigarettes as she didn't have sufficient capital to start a big business.  Her prudent quality shows because after a year, she could refill her paan corner with cosmetic products and used clothes. She says her shop location gives more advantages than the rest of the shop. She gets more customers from bus passengers who are departing and arriving in the town. She now enhanced the family income by triple and shares her husband's burden.\r\n \r\nWith the loan, she will buy more stock for the shop including summer used clothes like kurtees, medi-pants, T-shirts, shorts etc. Her aspiration is to buy a mini-van and use it for hiring purposes. Her husband earns by driving someone else's vehicle, which is tiring and high risk because if there is unfortunate accidental damage, the driver has to pay. She says after she joined the Phanem Group, she grew in different manners of life. She gained trust from other business partners and opened more doors for income-generating activities. Hatneineng and her husband also support her sister-in-law in pursuing her BSc Nursing degree. She will complete her course soon. Her accomplishments are uncountable says Hatneineng. She and her husband will work side-by-side to achieve what they dream of and will surely be successful.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in a ginger farm, a piggery, a garment-selling business etc. All the group members follow a group savings and a meeting is conducted on the second Sunday of every month. She says she is honored to be in the Phanem Group and thanked WSDS and Kiva for the support and love shown to the group. She considers it a personal blessing and prays to God for the growth of both WSDS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1346059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To refill her stocks with more cosmetic products and summer used clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-09T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-08T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneiting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemjavei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-12T06:28:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":556661,"name":"Assumpta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Assumpta, 40 years old, is a married woman and has been blessed with five kids.

Today, her business has grown, and her customers are located around her house, where she has her little restaurant, while she makes her purchases for cash in the public market. Her goal is to expand her business, and for that she needs working capital, which will allow her to increase her production and obtain new customers.

Hoichong lives an exemplary life for other women folks in the village. Her right arm is paralyzed but she is capable of performing every household chore with only the help of her left arm. She also generates income for the family by weaving and raising pigs. She is the secretary of Jingvalpa Group and she is the featured borrower of the group. She is pictured with her hand raised. Hoichong still looks young and strong after raising eight children.\r\n \r\nHoichong weaves with the help of the loom, using only her one arm. She also raises pigs. She can weave all the different patterns and the latest designs. Her woven products are mostly traditional women's wrap around skirts and men's shawls, which are considered to be the most expensive ones. She sells her woven products in her village and nearby villages. Since her village is about 3 1\/2 kms away from the town market, she goes there only on market day, which is every Friday. On the other days, she raises pigs and finds feed for the pigs in the nearby fields. She says her pigs are all healthy and they are growing fast. She hopes to make a good sale when they are fully grown. She paid back her previous loan on time and managed to have a group savings with the other group members. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase two more piglets and more yarn for the weaving business.  She shares that facilities for physically different persons were applied for by her husband so that she could avail government schemes to promote herself in generating an income for the family. The required proceedings were followed but it took longer than expected. By that time, she had joined Jingvalpa Group and now she is able to make an income for the family, which makes her believe in herself more. She says her confidence grows more with the family and society too. The family burden is now shared financially by her. She thanks WSDS and Kiva for all the support and assistance provided to them. She says, \"Thank you so much\".\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in a piggery, a vegetable-selling business, a rice-selling business, and weaving.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1345123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more yarn to weave and two more piglets to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-09T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-08T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoishi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongvei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chogneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimkhongah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneirose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neibem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-09T12:25:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":556838,"name":"Magaly Esther","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gracias por apoyar a Magaly, quien con su anterior credikiva logr\u00f3 comprar una vitrina y surti\u00f3 el negocio con ropa y \u00fatiles escolares, que tuvieron una buena demanda en su mercado objetivo.

Taking out this loan will offer Majed and his family comfortable furniture so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. \r\n\r\nIn order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

When his harvest is ready he stores his crops in the granaries that are shown in the photo to then go out to sell them in the basic grain market near his home. \r\n\r\nManuel hopes to increase his sales and for this reason he is requesting a loan which would allow him to buy seeds, fertilizer, manure, pesticides and other supplies. He hopes to count on the help requested because of the fact that he does not have other sources of income. In this way, he will continue being able to put food on the table each day without any setbacks.

Just one year ago, she began providing taxi services to local people using her own automobile on work days. On the weekends, she and her husband make and sell jackets to vendors in various districts at wholesale prices. Last year they began building a house on their land because the Mongolian winter is very harsh, forcing them to burn lot of coal to heat the ger so they don't freeze. But due to lack of finances, they haven't finished their house completely and some necessary items are remaining. She is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT to purchase vacuum insulated windows, metal shakes used for roofing and cement. As you can see from the picture, her house needs roofing and windows. After using these materials, she and her husband can complete their house and provide warm and comfortable accommodation for their children. More importantly, this new high quality house won't lose its heat and will enable the family to reduce its coal consumption, thus contributing to efforts against air pollution by releasing less smoke to air.

I used to work for a company, but when I started having babies, it became impossible, so I started making tamales (mexican food made of corn) and sell them. I am a fighter because I want to build a safety net for my children and because of that I'm willing to work very hard now that I am young. Of course, I also take very seriously my responsibility as a wife, mother and partner.\n\nFortunately, my business is growing rapidly and I need the loan to build a cellar where I can put the corn leafs and other inputs that I use to make the tamales such as: chile, chocolate, cinamon and other species. In the future, I'll like to buy a mill. By building the cellar, I will be able to buy inputs in larger quantities and get better prices. I know this is a big expense, but I am confident that my business will benefit greatly and I will be able to pay the loan.\n\nI will like to add, that I start cooking the tamales at 3 AM, because the tamales need to be warm and ready at 6 AM.  I started my business 4 years ago and my biggest accomplishment is that it has been growing since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1348433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
