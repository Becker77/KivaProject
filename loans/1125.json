She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter; ingredients that she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory.

Among the products she sells are rice, sugar, eggs, milk, flour, noodles and bananas, among others.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in business for a year and this makes it possible for her to earn extra income to help her husband with basic household expenses.

Segundo was unfortunately unable to do the heavy machinery maintenance and repair technical degree that he wanted to take, due to a lack of economic resources and the necessity that he begin working at a very young age. \r\n\r\nIn his spare time he likes to play soccer with his friends and sometimes cooks a delicious dish of \"Arroz Chaufa\" (Peruvian fried rice) to share with his family. At his own initiative, with a lot of hard work and dedication, Segundo works as a supervising field worker at an agricultural estate in his city. He works every day for about 10 hours and thinks that it is going well for him because of his good performance and the friendly way that he treats others. \r\n\r\nSegundo is very appreciative of Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he will be able to improve his home. The walls of his kitchen are damaged and need to be sealed and painted, and he needs to put in a floor. In this way, Segundo and his family will have better security and well-being. Segundo will continue to work and push himself to achieve his great dream of being able to study a professional degree. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1346637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to improve his home.

children. For 25 years, her husband has been running a wood shop, which is the only source of income for their family. He is an excellent carpenter and he is skilled at making good quality furniture. \r\n\r\nParveen has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband in his business. Her husband will purchase a wood cutting machine and some tools like hammers, nails, wooden sheets, glue, etc. for his shop. As they have no other source of income, with the help of this loan, her husband will be able to continue his business, and with the net profit he will open a new shop for his son. Parveen prays for her children's bright future and her husband's good health.

capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Bayanmunkh has been providing transportation services to local people for ten years and he usually picks up his customers at an outdoor market. His wife makes and sells traditional Mongolian clothes to vendors at wholesale prices. Before this work, his wife was working as a saleswoman at a private business. Bayanmunkh's eldest daughter is an eleventh-grade student in high school. \r\n\r\nThe house the family lives in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repairs, such as replacing the roof, windows, and floors. So Bayanmunkh is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass, and foam. Using these materials, he can repair and insulate his house, providing a warmer and more comfortable home for his family. The importance of renovating the house is that it will enable the family to burn less coal, release less carbon dioxide, and contribute to the efforts to reduce air pollution. Bayanmunkh is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better

capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional 'ger' (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. She has been working as a waitress at a private business entity for four years. Her husband is employed as a carpenter by a wooden products sales company. Her elder son studies at high school while her younger son is at kindergarten. \r\n\r\nDuring winter time the family are chilled to the core due to living in an old deteriorated Mongolian traditional 'ger'. So this year, they began building their own house but couldn't finish it due to lack of finances. So Otgonchimeg is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, bricks, cement and metal shakes. If she can complete her house, their children can live in a comfortable and warm place. The high quality house will enable the family to burn less coal, releasing less carbon dioxide and thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution. Living in a house is way better than living in a 'ger' in terms of both warmth and comfort. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who doesn't want her husband and sons to be chilled to the core in harsh wintertime.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family runs an agricultural business. They own a plot of land where mandarins, nut trees and maize are grown. All the harvested products are sold locally at the markets. The family receives additional income, i.e., a salary earned by Teimuraz\u2019s wife. She is teaching foreign languages (English and German).\r\n\r\nRecently, Teimuraz requested a loan from Credo, to start up a family business. Teimuraz has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Teimuraz will open a wine cellar. He will purchase wine at the wholesale price, and resell it with a price markup from the commercial space that he already owns.  As Teimuraz will not have to pay rent for the space, and he will be selling wine himself from the shop, the profit will be significant. This will make the business successful, and the family will be able to improve their living conditions.

Her loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nZinaida is trading clothes.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 milking cows, 2 calves, 2 horses, a pig and 2 piglets. They produce cheese and sell it as well as the piglets locally. Besides this, they have a 1.5 hectare plot of agricultural land.  It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAnzor requested loan from Credo to start-up family business. Anzor has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Anzor will begin buy and sell calves. He plans to purchase calves and resell after few months at a higher price. This will increase the income of their family.

This is just enough to meet the family\u2019s needs. A major challenge that Ani is facing now in her business is the weather, and she often feels tired because of her busy schedule. She works from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the store and takes care of her children at the same time. In addition, she works as an aerobic instructor on the side to add to the family income. \r\n\r\nAni hopes as she grows her business, she can hire an employee and purchase inventory in bulk to reduce costs. She hopes to send her children to Islamic school. \r\n\r\nThe woman in the middle in the video is

She is a humble, hard-working woman, and she had three loans with a communal bank named 'Mujeres emprendedoras de Chilamate' (meaning 'women entrepreneurs of Chilamate'). She had to leave the bank to care for her mother and, following her death, she was not able to join the bank again for administrative reasons. Vera sells food, mainly ceviche, at her house on week-ends, but her main activity is transportation services in her area, since there is no public transport there, the nearest bus station being one kilometre away. Many neighbours thus come to her for transportation. Her taxi was in an accident, and while she took the persons responsible to court, it is in need of repairs in the meantime. This is why she asks for a loan to repair it while waiting for the legal proceedings to come to an end. In view of her dire financial situation, Vera took another job to compensate for the loss of earnings from her transportation business. She is now a domestic worker in a house in Alajuela: three days a week, she leaves the house after preparing a meal for her husband, who works in the same city, and they take the bus together and come back in the afternoon. Vera then has to do housework in the evenings. She asks for this loan in order to be able to help support her family through her transportation business again. Her husband and her son, with whom she lives, are very supportive of her resuming her transportation activity. Vera's business is very small and she needs to complement it with other sources of income. Since her family is very poor, the income derived from her transportation business is essential to their survival. Repairs are therefore urgent. Vera turns to field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and to Kiva lenders for support through these difficult times. When Vera was a member of the communal bank, she was always on time for repayments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1347372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded

He lives in Shrosha village, Akhmeta district, with his 35-year-old wife, Nino, and three children (3, 9 and 10 years old). Khvicha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. They have two milk cows and a pig. The cows are milked every day to make dairy products, which is sold at the local markets. From the pig they have piglets and also sell them at the market. Additional family income is Nino\u2019s monthly salary. She is a teacher at the local school. \r\n\r\nKhvicha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the harvested products locally. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGamila requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Gamila has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith the credit, Gamila will purchase a car.

He has his own coal pits, where he produces coal and sells it at the local markets to earn a monthly income. Ramaz has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Ramaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Ramaz will renovate his shed and purchase calves. He wants to start farming. After raising the calves, he will sell them at a better price and earn good profit.

She is a single mother of 9, and these children are the only ones who help her with her farming activities such as pruning, cleaning and applying fertiliser and manure.  She has no educational qualifications because her oparents had very little money.  It was they who taught her, from a very young age, to work the land and, having done this for over 15 years, she has gained a great deal of experience and knows how to grow produce for sale.  The effort and hardwork she devoted to realising her ambitions enabled her to purchase her plot of land which adjoins the property where she lives and, therefore, enables her to maintain and look after her crops better.  She is currently seeking help to buy manure and fertiliser for her coffee plants so as to have a healthy crop which she can benefit 100% from.  Her ambitions are to provide for her children, since they are the only ones who help her with her farming activities, to fulfil her dream of cultivating a wider range of crops so as to boost income for the family, to allow them to continue their education and, in time, inherit the land which they now work.

With the increased income, Maguli will be able to provide for her son's education in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4200,"image":{"id":1347045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To buy a mini-bus.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Shua Ghele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-10T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-09T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":4200,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maguli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":4200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":118.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":146.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":147.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":149.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":154.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":155.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":159.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":160.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":163.61},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":171.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":169.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":173.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":175.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":179.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":181.87},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":189.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":191.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":195.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":198.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":202.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":206.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":209.27},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":212.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.6,"local_amount":118.6,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":118.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749690},{"amount":4081.4,"local_amount":4081.4,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4081.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613595}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T16:18:42Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":557142,"name":"Salim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salim is a married woman with seven children, all of whom attend school.

His loan request was rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is the small salary earned by Genadi working as the driver of a cargo truck. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGenadi requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Genadi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his loan, Genadi will renovate his minibus and work on a mini-bus line. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1347073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to renovate his minibus and work on his minibus line.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Mejinistskali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-10T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-09T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":66.66,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749691},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":74.99,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613596},{"amount":76.15,"local_amount":76.15,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":76.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857310},{"amount":78.11,"local_amount":78.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":78.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133962},{"amount":80.72,"local_amount":80.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":80.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107551},{"amount":82.22,"local_amount":82.22,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":82.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255096},{"amount":84.79,"local_amount":84.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":84.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019241},{"amount":86.53,"local_amount":86.53,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":86.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670379},{"amount":88.76,"local_amount":88.76,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":88.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141026},{"amount":281.07,"local_amount":281.07,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":281.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467956781}],"funded_date":"2013-05-23T17:26:01Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:18:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maggie Evans","image":859808}},{"id":557156,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is a 30-year-old mother from a market called Cross Over in Kisumu City.

He is married, but for health reasons does not have children. But despite this, Goyib and his wife live happily and harmoniously together, and in their family they have a full mutual understanding. Since they have no children who would take care of and support them, they are left to make a living for themselves. Therefore, they are engaged in their own business that brings them income to live. Goyib works in dekhan farming, growing potatoes and wheat. \r\n\r\nThis past season, he received a good profit from the harvest and he was able to buy a tractor with the profits to improve work performance. In his spare time, Goyib provides tractor services, working on the land for his neighbors and gets paid for these services.

She is married and is raising four children. For many years, she has lived in poverty as her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation and they are not able to provide their children with all the necessary means. Year after year, the children require more support. \r\n\r\nFor many years, she was engaged in services as a dressmaker, but because her income is small, she decided to organize a business buying and selling women's clothing and fabrics.

In particular, they have a plot of land where they grow maize and sell it locally. Their income is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nManuchar requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Manuchar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Manuchar will open a Georgian bread bakery. He will purchase all the needed equipment for building a bakery near his house. He hopes the business will be profitable because the location is very well populated.

He has a plot of land and a fruit orchard where he grows vegetables and fruits.  Hovhannes has a big coop next to his house and keeps his chickens, geese and ducks there.

young farmer Arman was born in the village Khnatsakh that is in the Kapan district. Arman moved to the town of Kadjaran and, since 2000, has lived there with his wife and four-year-old son. \r\n\r\nArman from an early age has been involved in raising cattle in his native village. At first he helped his father, but now he has his own farm. Arman already has nine cows and 15 sheep.\r\n \r\nArman sells meat and dairy products in the markets of Kapan and Kadjaran. Arman manages with his large cattle by himself; his wife is bringing up their son and is not able to help her husband much with the agriculture. \r\n\r\nArman loves his homeland, especially his native corner and never despite the difficulties has thought to leave the country for work abroad. Arman's big dream is to have many children and to teach the agriculture and animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nArman needs a loan to buy four young bulls, from which he expects in a year to get a decent profit. This is the first deal Arman has had with Kiva and he hopes for further cooperation with Kiva

She has a nuclear family with only a boy and a girl. Her husband runs a shop in the main town market and sells essential household supplies. She also helps in running the shop and on the other hand she is engaged in tailoring. She tailors different designs of mosquito net. Although her husband and she hold a graduate degree, there is very little opportunity for filling a job vacancy in the state government. Therefore both of them decided to do what it takes to survive.\r\n\r\nNirmala tailors and sells different types of mosquito nets to the women vendors in the town market and in the city market. She also gets supplies from other tailors; she supplies sewing\/tailoring materials to these tailors and pays their wages once the nets are stitched and finished. With the assistance of the other tailors, she can also produce three or four mosquito nets maximum in a day. Her income has increased with time and she makes good sales during the festival season. \r\n\r\nNirmala equipped herself with the required sewing\/tailoring materials and also informs the other tailors before the busy days begin, i.e., the festival season. The demand is high and the supply usually is short if one does not pre-plan because the embroidered mosquito net is used as a special gift on many occasions. Every single house in the state celebrates the festival during this season, so a gift is a must for every household which is a great advantage for business. \r\n\r\nWith the profits she also stocks her husband's shops with more variety and also makes her loan repayment successfully. She also joined a local Investment Body wherein one deposits a stipulated amount of money on daily basis and once it is mature, one can get back the amount with interest. Besides this she also joined a group savings with the other group members.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva Loan, she will purchase more supplies for tailored mosquito nets and refill stock to sell in the shop. She wants to invest in the shop because she wants to expand the shop in the future.  Her husband is a good businessman and careful with money, therefore she believes that both of them can work hard and be successful in their business. The rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving and tailoring.

I admired the fact that whereas before he had to go from place to place on his bicycle, he was able to save enough to get a motorcycle.

I told him I wanted to learn, and he helped me get a job at the workshop.\r\n\r\nThanks to the help of the workshop owner, the other artisans, and especially my brother, little by little I learned more and developed my skills. After some years, constant training and a lot of effort, I decided to start my own workshop. Like with every new beginning, it was tough at first and I worked very hard to get ahead. It's been more than 30 years since I got started in handcrafted jewelry. Now is when I most treasure what I enjoy doing, because it has allowed me to bring food to the table and provide my children with an education.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never imagined I could receive this kind of help.

I'm motivated by a desire to highlight women's beauty and personality through my designs and creations. I have the best job in the world and I give it my all: my patience, my love and my hard work.

Three years ago, Frank began harvesting and selling basil plants out of his backyard.\r\n\r\n He buys basil seedlings and nurtures the plants until they are three to four feet tall. Once the plants are able to be plucked and used regularly with little maintenance, Frank sells them on consignment to markets, food stands, and retail stores. Although the business began informally, Basil World quickly gained popularity, and Frank found himself with a growing number of clients and buyers. \r\n\r\nFrank recently has been presented with the opportunity to sell his basil plants to five Market Basket stores throughout the Northeast. This contract would allow Frank to quadruple his sales over the summer. However, in order to meet this demand, Frank needs money to purchase as many seedlings as possible and to hire additional employees.

She is a fighter with a great desire to get ahead.  She is married and is the mother of 3 children who are in different grades at primary school.  She did not complete any level of education because her parents were poor and could not help her.  They taught her to work the land when she was very young because they had traditionally worked at this activity.  She has a great deal of experience as she has worked growing coffee for more than 8 years.  The land that she cultivates together with her husband is their own, and was inherited from her parents-in-law.  The land is located 100 meters from her house and she goes there daily on foot.  Maria is requesting a loan to buy manure and fertilizer for her coffee crop, because with these products she can guarantee her harvest and avoid it being infected by pests and diseases such as blight.

Abdelkareem appears in the photo.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She started farming more than 20 years ago and her main source of income is organic cacao.  She has farmland where she works with great enthusiasm, since she bought it after many years of hard work as a field hand.  After having been abandoned by her husband for ten years, she took charge of the crops.  On her land we can find organic cacao and achiote crops, which she sells to suppliers in the zone because these products are in high demand.\r\n\r\nShe will hire local field hands and will recover her investments at the end of the season.  At times she has had to deal with setbacks such as blights that affect her crops.  She needs an increase in capital to do this work.  She is proud to provide a good education for her children without help from her former husband.\r\n\r\nShe feels like she is getting weaker over the years and so she wants to save up enough money to start building a home out of solid materials and also start a small business like a food store.  She is happy to be getting a second loan through Kiva and is committed to make her payments on time.  She is asking for 3,000 PEN so she can acquire another plot of land on which to raise cacao and increase her income with greater production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1348127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de terreno agr\u00edcola.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-10T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-09T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":325.74},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":350.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":342.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":373.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":385.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":388.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":411.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":421.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.87,"local_amount":325.74,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":325.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530549},{"amount":134.48,"local_amount":350.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":350.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975575},{"amount":131.44,"local_amount":342.87,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":342.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996844},{"amount":143.23,"local_amount":373.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":373.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864317},{"amount":147.95,"local_amount":385.95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":385.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352687},{"amount":148.88,"local_amount":388.4,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":388.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904452},{"amount":157.72,"local_amount":411.43,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":411.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090511},{"amount":161.43,"local_amount":421.13,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":421.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777286}],"funded_date":"2013-05-12T05:38:16Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

It\u2019s a poor neighborhood with many limitations.  [Damaris] is a person with many desires of getting ahead.  She has been making arts and crafts for the past ten years.  She is constantly teaching herself so that she can offer high quality products to her customers.  Aside from decorations, she makes quality purses, covers for appliances, bath articles, and products for birthday parties, first communions, and baptisms.  She is well known in the zone for being dedicated to this work and so she is not in need of customers during the year.\r\n\r\nShe began by buying a small amount of items with her husband\u2019s help, began training herself and improving her techniques.  She diversified her production, increasing her number of customers, and improving her income.  The goal for this loan is to buy supplies and some tools.  Schools from the area seek her out to make things for school parties due to the quality of her work.\r\n\r\nShe works throughout most of the day and her daughter is in university.  Her younger children attend school.  Her first daily task is to prepare food for them so they can go to school.  Given the great quantity of orders, she works into the night.  She does her work by hand but once the machine is repaired things will speed up and she can increase her production and spend more time with her family.\r\n\r\nHer main obstacle has been lack of capital, but this loan will allow her to have the money she needs to buy supplies and increase her production and reach her dream of fixing up her hose.  She repaid her first loan and wants to continue having support from Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and Kiva so she can support her children\u2019s educations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1018605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded

She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJosephine operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five PHP's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nJosephine dreams of having her own stall for the business and hopes to have their own house.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. She can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She dedicates herself to selling clothing. She has spent five years doing this work and it has given her a lot of experience which allows her to make better earnings. The business is located in a market which is near her residence. She has provided for a lot of clients because the people know everything has good quality and good prices. She wants to increase her business but doesn't have sufficient capital to support herself. For this reason she is asking for a loan that will allow her to buy more clothes: pants, shirts, skirts, blouses, children's clothing, undergarments, etc. She is sure that she will repay the debt and at the same time has hope that it will bring her home economic security.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1348176,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The store is set up in his home which is located in a busy area, so he has many customers for his well-stocked business.\r\n\r\nManuel is a hard worker and, like all good salesmen, wants to increase business by making a new investment.  But he does not have the capital to do so and is requesting a loan to buy basic grains, sweets, eggs, bread, beverages, etc.  Manuel has a good credit record and is committed to paying back the loan.  He trusts this will give his family a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1348195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
