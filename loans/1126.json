He sells apples, bananas, and oranges in his shop. Presently he is interested to offer more variety to his customers which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However, due to the lack of funds, he finds it difficult. Therefore his wife Abida has requested a loan amount of 20,000 PKR from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of fruit from the field and sell the fruit in the market at a profitable price. With the profit amount her husband wants to grow his business in the future. Abida is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakiatan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1347588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a variety of fruit to sell.

Over the next few months she was able to obtain good earnings because she didn\u2019t have any competition in the area, which was the reason for her to acquire more merchandise on her next purchase.  Thanks to her earnings, she has been able to pay for her children\u2019s university education, giving her reason to keep working.  She sells primary needs products such as canned goods, and cold drinks of which she has great demand due to living in a tropical climate. \r\n\r\nShe wants to get more non-perishable items to increase her earnings and supply. Her business for a longer time.\r\n\r\nThis is a very selfless job because she can stay at home and not neglect caring for her children while her husband continues supporting the family financially from the fields.

They live in large traditional households in Ouelessebougou, in the Kati prefecture (Koulikoro region, Republic of Mali).\r\nThey have been involved in small business for several years and are highly sought-after for their work.\r\nWith the hope of satisfying the growing needs of their clientele, the group members decided to join Soro Yiriwaso's loan program three years ago. They are on their fifth solidarity (group) loan.\r\nSetou, who is the group's president and very well known in Ouelessebougou, excels in her business of selling cereals. She intends to use her loan to buy two sacks of locally produced rice and one sack of maize. She gets her supplies in Ouelessebougou and the neighbouring towns, and sells her goods in Ouelessebougou at retail, in cash and on credit to a clientele composed of men and women.\r\nShe hopes to earn a monthly profit of 23,000 FCFA, a sum that will allow her to repay the loan and reinvest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1349652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou Koulikoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-05-11T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-10T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":33532.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030189},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":33532.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819694},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":33532.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678598},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":33532.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924220},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":33532.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207414},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":33532.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972069}],"funded_date":"2013-05-11T19:47:00Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:51:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":557498,"name":"Ma.

However, due to the lack of finances, he finds it difficult. Therefore, his wife Suriya has requested a loan of 38,000 PKR from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at a profitable price. This will help him to increase his customers and daily income. With the profit amount, her husband wants to grow his business in the future. \r\n\r\nSuriya dreams of spending her life with better facilities and hopes that she will be able to provide a better education to her children.

He lives in a small village in Kvareli District with his wife, his three children and his mother, who receives a retirement pension. Gocha applied for loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan applications were always rejected because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of the income for the family is from an agricultural business. They have a vineyard and sell wine locally. It hardly produces enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo's evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Gocha applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Gocha has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. \r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

","en":"For more than 10 years, Umarjon has educated and trained children in high school.  He is an educated, smart and goal-oriented person.  Umarjon actively participates in the educational system of the Republic of Tajikistan.  He teaches history and human rights.  Umarjon is a professional in his field.  He is married and has 2 children.  His kids are still little--they're both under 3 years old.  His wife, Nargiza, also works as a teacher at a high school.  Additionally, Umarjon farms since his salary isn't enough to provide his family with all necessities.  He and Nargiza have saved a bit of money to make repairs to their home but they do not have enough savings to buy building materials.  Umarjon is asking for a loan of 3,000 somoni to buy these construction materials.  He awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1346062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

live does not meet housing standards and he urgently needs to make renovations.  Mahmadyor is 37 years old, married and has 3 children.  His wife, Inobatjon, is a homemaker and spends her time raising the children--aged 3 to 9.  The older children attend school and always ask their parents to repair their home.  Unfortunately, their salary doesn't allow it.  Mahmadyor must renovate all rooms and prepare the structure for winter since it is a very cold time in Tajikistan, and a home should be comfortable throughout the season.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nLasha and his wife are working at private companies to earn small monthly salaries.  Lasha is working as a security guard and his wife is an operator at the local market. Family total income is rarely enough to cover their monthly food expenses.   \r\n\r\nLasha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Lasha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions a provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Lasha will purchase a milk cow. The cow will be milked every day to make dairy products, which will be sold at the local markets. This will increase the family income and help them to improve their living conditions.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1347749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a milk cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Sartichala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-12T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-11T00:20:06Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lasha ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":155.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":159.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":164},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":169.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":173.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":101.12,"local_amount":163.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":166.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969227},{"amount":92.75,"local_amount":150.4,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":152.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749696},{"amount":96.14,"local_amount":155.91,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":158.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613602},{"amount":98.27,"local_amount":159.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":162.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857316},{"amount":101.13,"local_amount":164,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":166.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133968},{"amount":104.5,"local_amount":169.46,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":172.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107557},{"amount":107.14,"local_amount":173.74,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":176.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255102},{"amount":223.95,"local_amount":363.16,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":369.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019247}],"funded_date":"2013-05-13T00:26:01Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn  Dalsing","image":null}},{"id":557584,"name":"Elgine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elgine is 28 years old and married.

Beka has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Beka will open a plumbing shop.

He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Ivane will purchase raw materials for his cement workshop.

His loan requests were rejected because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nAdam\u2019s sister works as a teacher at a local school and his mother works as a baker, each generating a small monthly income. Adam has a tractor which he rents out as well. However, their incomes are hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family is categorized as subsistence poor. \r\n\r\nAdam requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Adam has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Adam will pay a toll for another tractor. After the toll is paid, he will renovate it and rent it out to increase the income of his family.

She lives in the Rustavi district of Georgia with her parents, sister and retired grandfather.  Ana requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but did not have any success. Her loan request was rejected because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nAna is a teacher of Microsoft Office programs. She is giving private lessons and earns a small monthly salary. Her father is working on a mini bus-line and her sister is video operator. Their family also receives additional income from Ana\u2019s grandfather\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n\r\nAna requested a loan from Credo to start-up a business. Ana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. With her credit Ana will rent a commercial space and purchase all the needed equipment to open a Microsoft Office learning center. As Ana will have a bigger space and more computers she will be able to give group lessons and have more students. She is already well known in this field in her district, so her business will be successful. This will significantly increase her income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of her family.

But the money Merab earns is hardly enough to pay for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n<p>\r\nMerab requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\nMerab then requested a 3000 USD start-up loan from Credo. His request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisions providing start-up and re-startup loans with easy terms to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as high-risk borrowers due to low incomes. \r\n<p>\r\nWith his loan Merab will open an auto parts shop. As he is well known locally and has a good number of clients, he thinks that the business will be profitable. This new business initiative financed with a Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of Merab\u2019s

She works from 10 am to 7 pm if she is in her trading center but normally she travels up country for business. She is able to make a small profit per month. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. The previous loans, all of which she has paid back successfully, she used to add more rolls of material for her tie and dye.

She lives in Ikalto village, Telavi district, with her 32-year-old husband, Besik, and her retired mother-in-law. Pikria requested a loan from local financial institutions several times, for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nPikria and her husband are working, receiving small monthly salaries. She is an accountant at the local factory, and Besik is an artisan and works on house renovations for private orders. The family also runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have a vineyard and a milk cow. The cow is milked every day to make dairy products, and these are sold with the harvested grapes, at local markets. The family receives some additional income -- specifically, Pikria\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n\r\nPikria requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Pikria has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith her credit, Pikria will purchase a truck. Her husband will be driving the truck and transporting cargo on private orders. This will help them to earn additional income for the family. The profit will be used for expanding the agricultural business. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up Loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMamuka has a 0.5-hectare plot of agricultural land, where vegetables and citrus are grown. He sells the harvested products at local markets. Mamuka\u2019s mother works as a cook at a local restaurant, and gets monthly income. They earn hardly enough to have food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMamuka requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Mamuka has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Mamuka will open a local grocery store. This will increase the income of the family.

Members who stand out include those who have a ruca (a traditional home of the Mapuches), artists who work in wool and leather, massage therapists, those who work in tourism, designers, gardeners, and those who sell food out of street carts.\r\n\r\nZunilda, who is our interviewee, tells us that she has a little food cart, and she also sells handicrafts. She tells us that she started her business approximately 11 years ago, and that she learned everything from her culture, the mapuche culture. There was always present in her life crocheting, weaving, making handicrafts, and cooking typical foods, as well as having a stove where she brought to life the meals of Chile. She also teaches free classes to those who want to learn the trade. She has had many problems getting ahead because on the way she has lost her mother, her husband, and her son. In addition to being alone caring for her land, her siblings decided to leave to live in the city, looking for more work, and they abandoned her. This is why she has had to work alone and care for her land alone. Also, she has not had the water she needs because where she lives there is not plumbing for water. The only thing to do is go look for it in the lakes or take it out of wells. This is why her business has been affected. Because of this, she has to leave her land and go live somewhere else. With the loan that she will receive, she will be able to buy more supplies for her business such as wool and supplies to teach her classes for free. She hopes that things will go very well for her business even though she has to relocate. She knows that it could go very well for her. She has greatly enjoyed working with Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza for the loans she has requested and the responsibility of working with them.\r\n\r\n**Translator's note: The advertisement in the background of the photo says \"To know that you help me, for me is a miracle.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5600,"image":{"id":1349037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

.","en":"Exson is 19 years old, single, and lives in his parents' home.  He supports his parents because he is a very hard-working young man.  For the past year, Exson has been working on a plot of farmland that his parents gave him so that he could make income and improve his quality of life.  He decided to work the land because he has been learning techniques for growing top-quality produce such as organic cacao since he was a young child.  At first, he experienced some financial problems in buying supplies such as organic fertilizer and tools, and he needed support from his parents.  Every morning, Exson travels to his plot of land, which is an hour away from his town, and returns home before the sun sets as he lives in an area with small, dangerous roads. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the harvest season, Exson's cacao pods are dried in the sun and then sold to wholesalers in his region who evaluate their quality and offer him a final price.\r\n\r\nExson believes his work to be pretty hard but it also motivates him to improve himself and fulfill his own goals.  This is his first loan from Kiva and he is grateful for the opportunity and the trust that is being placed in him so that he can achieve his goals.  He needs 1,000 soles to buy organic fertilizer and invest in his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1349064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-12T10:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-11T10:30:06Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Exson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":108.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":116.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":114.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":124.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":128.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":129.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":137.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":140.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.43,"local_amount":108.57,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":113.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530553},{"amount":46.77,"local_amount":116.93,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":122.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975579},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":114.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":119.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996848},{"amount":49.82,"local_amount":124.54,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":130.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864321},{"amount":51.45,"local_amount":128.64,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":134.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352691},{"amount":51.79,"local_amount":129.46,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":135.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904456},{"amount":54.85,"local_amount":137.14,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":143.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090515},{"amount":56.18,"local_amount":140.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":146.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777290}],"funded_date":"2013-05-13T17:15:57Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":558453,"name":"Natividad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Natividad de 53 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su familia en casa propia, ella tiene un negocio de venta de recuerdos para fiestas rosas, bodas, bautizos, etc. tiene mucha clientela pues sus productos los vende a precios accesibles, Do\u00f1a natividad solicita un credito para poder comprar todo lo necesario para elaborar los recuerdos como: candelas de silicon, telas, blondas, listones de colores, etc. para seguir con su negocio y poder llevar el pan diario a su hogar.","en":"53-year-old Natividad lives with her family in her own home.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nArmen has a grocery shop and he earns small daily income for the family. He also trades fruits and vegetables. His mother has a health problems and she is getting a monthly pension from government institutions. \r\n\r\nArmen requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Armen has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Armen will open a car service center. He will purchase all the needed materials to build the center and also the equipment for it. Armen is a car artisan and wants to start his new business.

Her house is made from wood and she lives there with her five children, two of whom are already adults and independent.  Hilda's business is selling breakfasts from a cart.  In the past, she was financially dependent on her husband as her job was caring for their children.  However, as the children grew up, she decided to work outside the home in order to improve the family's financial situation.\r\n\r\nHilda used some money that she and her husband had saved up to buy her fast-food cart which she sets up outside the local school and sells to her customers who are students and teachers.  She offers a wide range of quinoa-, maca root- and soy-based drinks as well as delicious bread filled with avocado, queso fresco (a soft, mild cheese), ham, etc.  Every day, Hilda wakes up very early so that she can prepare her food.  She does this because she likes offering her customers good-quality, fresh, good-tasting food.  She always thinks of her family's future as she works and her main long-term goals are to make enough money to re-build their home from solid building materials and to improve their quality of life.

Hawa says that the main challenges to her business are the poor road network and that sometimes the vehicle breaks down on the way.\r\n\r\nHawa has requested a loan in order to purchase more gallon of palm oil for resale.

SMEP is a Deposit Taking Microfinance institution born out of an initiative of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK). It began as a feeding programme to feed the Mathare slum dwellers in Nairobi, Kenya. NCCK realized that the poor needed to be self reliant and economically empowered and the feeding programme was transformed into a micro-credit scheme. What started as a small project has grown into a deposit taking micro-finance institution that has a dream of providing many financial solutions to entrepreneurs. In future, SMEP plans to become a fully fledged Christian bank.

Her main challenges are competition and the high costs of transport while sourcing for the goods, but she believes she can reduce this by purchasing large quantities through this loan. \r\n\r\nNeema is applying for a loan of 31,500 Kenya shillings to buy food stock like flour, cooking fat, rice, fuel wood etc. She will use the extra from the loan to improve on the living standards of her family, and especially education.

","en":"Zarifjon is 39 years old. He is a very conscientious man. He is married and raising two children. His wife is a teacher at a secondary school, and his children are not yet of working age. They go to secondary school. \r\n\r\nZarifjon has worked with construction services for more than 8 years, building houses and other objects. He is a very good family man and works hard for his family to live in abundance. He plans to build a new house for his family, however, his income does not allow him to start building. He plans to build a house with a new and modern layout, which has all services.

She lives with her husband in the Angoul\u00eame district of S\u00e9gou (the Republic of Mali's fourth administrative region).\r\n\r\nSalimata did not attend school for social reasons and thus at an early age started income-generating activities with her mother who sold clothes. After several years' apprenticeship at her mother's side she decided to build up a similar business by herself. She now has ten years' experience in this field and has a large network of customers, made up principally of retailers. Her shop is in the Ch\u00e2teau market near to the vegetable sellers, and access to the shop is easy. The strength of her sales is due to the quality of her clothing which is imported from Togo, Burkina and Nigeria, and also to her affordable prices. \r\n\r\nWith a view to increasing her capital so that she can meet customer demand, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso and has had a relationship with the institution for the past 48 months. Having had four group loans and two individual loans, she is now on her third individual loan with which she is planning to buy five bundles of  \"pagnes wax\" (highly decorative and colourful pieces of fabric). She generally gets her supplies from Nigeria.\r\n\r\nSalimata sells for cash and on credit to a customer base made up mainly of women, and with this loan she is expecting to make a monthly profit of 100,000FCFA. This will enable her to repay her loan to Soro Yiriwaso and increase her capital.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1349690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-05-12T15:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-11T15:00:20Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678613},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924224},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207416},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972075},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624697},{"amount":90.9,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850734},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740403},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459219905},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468044868},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263015},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":45726.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490959936}],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T23:31:28Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T18:51:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":557909,"name":"Francia Jazmin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La clienta Francia vive en Guayaquil.

","en":"Gafurjon is 32 years old. He is married and raising three children. His children are 1, 4 and 7 years old. His wife is a very good woman concerned with cleanliness. She is a housewife and does not have a source of income. Gafurjon is the sole supporter of the family. \r\n\r\nFor more than eight years Gafurjon has provided a carpenter service, refurbishing houses. He has \"golden hands\" and is an excellent builder. He builds beautiful houses, but lives in an old house himself, as he does not have enough money to purchase a new house.

She lives with her husband and children in the Hamdallaye A district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of Mali). Not having attended school for social reasons, from an early age on she started earning a living alongside her mother, who used to sell condiments. After several years of this apprenticeship, she tried various business activities on her own (selling soap, cereals etc) before ending up selling coconuts. She has been in this business for 10 years and has a large customer base. Her success is due to her skill in running this business and also to her affordable prices in comparison to the competition.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing her working capital and meeting customer demand, she has reached out to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso for 72 months; after four solidarity loans and four individual loans, all duly reimbursed, she is now on her fifth individual loan intended to buy 2,000 coconuts. She stocks up locally. Mrs. Sarata sells for cash and on credit to a customer base composed mainly of women. With this loan, she anticipates earning a monthly revenue of 90,000 West African francs, which will allow her to take her of household expenses and bolster her working capital.\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1349694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy coconuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-05-12T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-11T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678614},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924225},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207417},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972076},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624698},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850735},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:21:58Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740404},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459219906},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468044869},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263016},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.7,"processed_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":27435.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490959937}],"funded_date":"2013-05-12T21:44:12Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T18:51:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":557741,"name":"Nazir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Nazir is a 51-year-old married woman.

She lives with her husband and her sixteen-year-old son in a house of her own. She is full of enterprising spirit and never admits defeat in the face of hardship. A few years ago, she decided to start a small shop at her house, and has been keeping this small business going for five years, thanks to her great dedication and to all the efforts she made. Leonicia has a lot of customers, whom she values above all else in her business, and for whom she always has a warm smile ready. Her dream is to give her son a better life. She knows her small business is her only source of income, which is why she asks field partner Integral for a loan in order to invest in it. She needs to buy supplies of all kinds to sell, such as rice, broad beans, sugar, milk, coffee, candy, cooking oil, paper, detergent, and other products that are very much in demand. She feels confident that this investment will help her make her dream come true and grant her more economic

job to job across the United States. He was paid well. But then the industry started steadily declining, and work got sent overseas. Finally, he said, contract work just disappeared. \r\n\r\nAs work started drying up five years ago, Gary slowly turned his hobby and passion for attending motorcycle events into a business. \r\n\r\n\u201cBasically, it was out of desperation to find something to do to sustain myself,\u201d Gary said. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone to motorcycle events, but never as a vendor. But I had seen people doing it and knew it was something I could do.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt first, Gary sold just a few hats at a time, using a friend\u2019s table, and discovered that the \u201cMade in America\u201d label drew customers to his hats. \r\n\r\nGary recently officially opened a full-time business, doing business as Bud\u2019s Emporium and also as Daddy BUD\u2019s DooRags. He travels the Southern part of the nation, going to motorcycle events and music festivals, selling doorags \u2013 motorcycle riders\u2019 head coverings, and welder\u2019s style hats, face coverings, neck coolers, highway and motorcycle-related vintage-style signs, jewelry, as well as Android phones and computer tablets. He doesn\u2019t have a website, but he has a Facebook page where people can keep track of his locations: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DaddyBUDsDooRags \r\n\r\nGary took his first spin on a motorcycle when he was five years old, when a teen-aged neighbor was offering kids rides on his Cushman Eagle. That first ride turned a fascination into a passion and a lifestyle for Gary, who is riding the same Harley Davidson Shovelhead that he bought in 1973.\r\n\r\nGary was in South Texas, working the motorcycle shows during the winter months this year, when it became clear that his truck needed to be replaced. He learned about Accion Texas through a news report with Bill Clinton announcing the Kiva-Accion Texas partnership in Little Rock this March.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a fan of Bill Clinton and even worked on some of his campaigns,\u201d Gary said. \u201cWhen I saw this announcement, it caught my interest.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe decided to apply for a loan to buy a used, 17-foot U-Haul box truck to replace his truck and to take his business to the next level.
