The ladies are engaged in various businesses including the sale of new and used clothing, shoes, tortillas, produce and snacks. Some own small retail storefronts.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank enjoys meeting together once each month. They make payments on their loan. They also receive valuable edcational training on various topics like family planning, economics, savings as well as the rights of children. They are able to implement what they learn into their lives which helps them create different patterns in their own lives as well as in their families.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a 50-years-old member of \u201cUvas\u201d who has benefited from her loans. Several years ago, she and her family began to manufacture and sell various types of shoes. Currently, she needs more capital for the business and so she is requesting a loan with Friendship Bridge. She will use the funds to increase her working capital and purchase materials for shoes. In this way, she will be able to meet the needs of her customers instead of stopping production. In addition, Carmen will be able to sell shoes in two nearby markets each week. She is pleased that her business can continue to generate income in order to maintain her household expenses. She tells us that both she and her husband can provide a higher standard of living to their entire family.\r\n \r\nThe ten micro-entrepreneurs of the \u201cUvas\u201d Trust Bank are grateful for the loans that they have received through KIVA and Friendship Bridge.

He is very kind, hardworking, and enthusiastic person who dreams of excelling. Unfortunately, due to scarce financial resources, Lizardo had to begin working at a very young age and was not able to study Culinary Arts like he wanted to. However, thanks to his natural talent and the support of his mother, Lizardo learned to cook many different regional dishes from his city. \r\n\r\nBy his own intiative and with much determination and dedication, Lizardo works as a chef in a restaurant in the city. He also works as a taxi driver in the mornings before cooking.

Until 2012 her employment was part time, and in 2013 she became employed as a full time staff member, increasing her salary and covering food and other, work-associated, costs.\r\n\r\nThe house that Gantumur and her son live in has deteriorated over the years, and it needs some serious repairs. So she is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT, which she will use to purchase building and insulation materials, such as planks, bricks, concrete, fiberglass and foam. Using these materials, she herself can repair and insulate her house, thus creating a comfortable and warm place. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and thereby contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a hardworking individual, who wants to see her son live well and happily.

Mar\u00eda is hardworking and entrepreneurial. She is very keen to get on in life despite the difficulties that exist in the country. She is married and has five children; her eldest daughter will graduate this year as a computer technician, her second oldest only stayed in school to grade 3, the next two are in primary school, and the youngest is too small to go to school. Mar\u00eda herself did not complete primary education; she only attended up to grade 3. She couldn\u2019t continue her studies as her parents were poor and couldn\u2019t support her.\r\n\r\nIt was her parents who taught her how to grow coffee, and today she and her husband earn their living this way. They are grateful to God for the land that they cultivate since it is their own, thanks to her husband\u2019s parents who gave it to them. The land is located 50 metres from their house so it is easy for them to look after it.\r\n\r\nToday Mar\u00eda is seeking a loan to buy manure and fertilizer for the coffee plants so that she will be able to have a successful and healthy crop of coffee beans. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s dream is to see her crop as the best in the area so that she can receive more income from it.

Marta is the single mother of three children, two of whom are foster children. She is hardworking and entrepreneurial with a great desire to get ahead in life in spite of the difficulties that exist in the country. She has grown coffee since she was a young girl; her parents taught her how to weed the fields, prune, cut etc. Marta did not complete primary school as she only attended up to grade 2. Her parents were poor and couldn\u2019t support her. Her fields are located 500 metres from her house and she walks there daily.\r\n\r\nThe only help that Marta receives is from her family; they help her keep the crops healthy and safe from disease. She also has a small nursery where she grows coffee plants that will soon be for sale.\r\n\r\nToday Marta is seeking a loan to buy manure and fertilizer so that she will be able to have a successful and healthy crop of coffee beans. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her crop as the best in the area so that she can receive more income from it. Selling quality beans will help her pay for her children\u2019s education, daily food, and the other necessities of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1349160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy manure and fertilizer for her coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-05-12T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-11T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":165.02,"local_amount":3143.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3158.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812884},{"amount":884.74,"local_amount":16856.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":16938.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.24,"payment_id":517523776}],"funded_date":"2013-05-13T19:52:46Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:08:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":557938,"name":"Khachik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khachik is 50 years old and lives with his wife in Tsovagyugh village, which is in the Sevan area.

bringing in the cash flow he once had.  As a single father, he started the business to support himself and his two children. \r\n\r\nPinnacle Power Wash cleans residential and commercial properties while protecting the environment from toxic wastes.  Pinnacle utilizes specially designed surface cleaning equipment, which fully contains and recaptures contaminants while simultaneously filtering and recycling wash water.  The surface is left clean and dry, and contaminants are removed as opposed to re-distributed.  To accomplish this process, the water temperature is raised to 200 degrees, which helps loosen grease, dirt, gum and many other stains.  \r\n\r\nA friend recommended Gregory to Accion Texas Inc. in Austin and he was able to obtain a loan to purchase the hot water high-pressure cleaner that improved his business.

All her life she has worked on a farm with cattle.  Because of this, she has gained much experience fattening cows and bulls.  For 20 years, she and her husband have worked fattening cattle because they know the ins and outs of caring for livestock.  Her husband works as a security guard at a local farm but his salary isn't enough to live on.  So each morning, Tufajon milks her cow and takes the milk to the city to sell.  At the moment, this additional income is not enough for Tufajon's goals so she wants to take out of a loan  to buy a more cattle to increase her income.  She plans to use the money from selling the cattle to make repairs to her home since it needs it.  She relies on Arvand's support to realize her dream.

They live in her parents' house. Her parents have always helped her out because she is their only daughter. \r\n\r\nNorma grows organic cacao on three hectares of land, which she purchased with Cesar's help. There is a lot of demand for organic cacao in the area, and they often hire local workers to help them with chores to maintain the plants such as pulling weeds, spreading organic manure, and harvesting. Moving sacks of dried cacao seed is difficult because the access roads to her field are very narrow, which increases transportation costs.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to build a house for her child and family so that they can live independently.

Her son gets a state pension because his father passed away so early. This year, her son is graduating from high school and will continue to study in university. Using her previous loan, she has made renovations and installed insulation in her house. This time, she is requesting a loan of 4,500,000 MNT to expand her house. House expansion will further reduce heat loss and provide more space for her family when her son gets married. Heat loss will reduce the usage of coal and will contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

The sources of her family\u2019s income are from rice farming and producing coops for sale. Sometimes, she works for others for a fee. She has been engaged in this business for 31 years. She can earn about 25,000 KHR per day to feed her family.\r\n\r\nRoen\u2019s group consists of two members who have been with VisionFund for four cycles.

She is an enterprising woman who has had to struggle for her family, given that she has separated from the father of her children more than 15 years ago, and she faced a situation where she has had to support her daughters.  It's been a year since she rebuilt her life and started a relationship.  During 15 years of work at a restaurant in the nation's capital, and selling clothing in different neighborhoods in the capital, she saved up little by little to build a humble home.  Later she returned to the community and with great effort opened a store to sell basic products such as rice, cooking oil, beans, sugar, vegetables, and other things.  The store is open to the public everyday from early morning to 8:00 pm.\r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise every week and some of it every three weeks.  She has to board a bus for a 20 minute ride to the city to buy her merchandise, and she goes with her daughters.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan, through Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, to buy sand, cement, iron bars, stone and to pay for labor to build a retaining wall in her home and also a kitchen.  Her house only has two bedrooms and a living room.  This loan will be very helpful since her house is small and the smoke from the wood fire causes harm to her family.  The wall will prevent her house from flooding, now that the rainy season is beginning.

She is married with seven children and six of them attend school.\r\nShe has been operating a hardware shop for the last twenty-five years, working seven days a week. She generates additional income from a beauty salon.\r\nShe has requested a loan of UGX 1,000,000 from MCDT- SACCO to increase her stock with more brushes, cardboard, nails, paint, thinner, hoes, knives and cement to sell as well as hair and body oils for her salon.

She will also buy food items for her shop like beans, maize, palm oil, groundnuts, and rice. She is very positive that her business will succeed because she has been doing it for a long time and is knowledgeable about the business. She has a good business location and regular customers who buy from her shop. At times, she also delivers her yogurt to schools and sells to students. Fienbi's business provides food stuffs to her community at a moderate price and allows them to obtain food without traveling long distances.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, Fienbi will expand her business, help the needy in the community, and pay for her children's medication, feeding, and education expenses.

Rukhsana's husband works at a boutique shop, but his income is not enough to meet the household expenses.\n\nRukhsana is a very hardworking and independent woman. By stitching clothes, she helps her husband meet the family's needs and her children's education expenses. She has been operating her business very efficiently and honestly for the past five years, and her clients always appreciate her work.\n\nRukhsana has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. With the loan amount, she will be purchasing a new sewing machine so that she can work more efficiently in the future. As she is living in a rented house with her family, she dreams of building her own house. She also desires to increase her business and to provide a quality education to her children. Rukhsana and her family are very much thankful to both BRAC and

The costs of medicine for treating sickness and for funeral preparations have left her with inadequate capital for her business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will buy flour, yeast, groundnut oil, sugar, a piglet, and feed to enable her to operate her business. She is positive this business will succeed because she has regular customers who often purchase fish from her for ceremonies. She has a good business site, and she has been in this  business for a long time. Her business provides the community with a regular supply of fish, which they often consume for breakfast. In addition, she will provide pig manure, which is used as fertilizer by local farmers.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she will pay her children's school fees and cater to other school needs. She will also educate the children of her late sister and brother. She prefers GHAPE loans because of low interest rates and convenient repayment intervals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1348708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She has a great aptitude for tailoring and the arts and because of this she decided to take a class to perfect her tradition and be able to earn more money to contribute to improving her home.\r\n\r\nIn a small workshop in her home she tailors clothing and to generate income she also offers internet and communications services.  Her goal is to have a larger and well-supplied business where her clients feel like they are in a comfortable environment and well taken care of, where they can appreciate the quality of Maria's work, in her tailoring as well as the administration of her small internet cafe.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason Maria has turned to a Kiva loan, through which she will buy a computer and air conditioner, to make the building a comfortable temperature and offer services to new clients, that often need to use the internet and will leave if they don't.  While this happens, Maria maintains a profitability over her sales no less than 33%, that is projected to increase gradually, especially with her Kiva loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1349948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

He is married and lives in the city of Cartagena, one of Colombia\u2019s nicest cities. He works there also, selling fried snacks and soft drinks, such as natural fruit juices made from seasonal tropical fruit. His drinks provide welcome refreshment to his customers soaking up the Columbian sun. \r\n\r\nOlman learned to make fried food 3 years ago, as his mother worked in this area also. In order to generate higher sales, he got the idea that he could sell the products his mother was making. He decided to sell these products from a mobile unit. From there he set up his own business, which soon started to grow. \r\n\r\nOlman invested in the business little by little, buying a tricycle and customizing it as a point of sale, and over time people have gotten to know his business. \r\n\r\nHis sales are done on a cash basis, from Monday to Saturday from 6:30 in the morning until 11 at night. His main group of customers are the people who frequent the city centre. He locates his tricycle in a business area, which increases his sales capacity. \r\n\r\nThe number of customers and the number of orders are constantly increasing. For this reason he has approached Kiva for a loan. This is his first time requesting finance. His request is through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. \r\n\r\nHe will use the money to buy a new tricycle, as well as raw materials and supplies for use in preparing the fried food. In this way he will be able to increase production and increase his market. \r\n\r\nHis goal for the future is to operate in more than one area and to have a distribution infrastructure all over Cartagena, in particular close to its lovely beaches, which he himself goes regularly.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1349937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Maria Elena is requesting a loan through Ceprodel, with Kiva investors' help, to buy rice, sugar, beans, sweets, and soap, and thereby satisfy her customers' needs.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Kiva investors because, thanks to such loans, she has maintained her business for all these years, allowing her to educate her only daughter for a profession.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1347470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Phanuel replied:  'Milk from the cow will help me feed my family, and the milk that I will sell will help to educate my children.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Phanuel owns the following: cow, poultry, motorcycle, but he does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

Currently they are facing many problems in the business, as the current stock of car accessories is almost depleted and they have no funds available to purchase more stock. Saiqa has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband can continue his business and purchase more variety of car accessories and decoration kits like car chargers, fog

She has been efficiently doing a business of milk selling and cattle rearing for many years now. She has one buffalo and two calves. She also purchases small calves and sells them near the Eid-ul-Azha (a religious event in Muslim countries like Pakistan). She earns a good profit from her business. \r\n\r\nIn order to grow her sales, she needs to purchase another buffalo.

married to 39 year old Raul.  They have several children and she has an adobe house where she shelters her family.  She raises and harvests organic cacao on a thee hectare parcel of land that she bought with the proceeds from many years of working and with help from her husband.\r\n\r\nShe has been working for 15 years alongside her oldest children who have been performing the constant tasks such as weeding and other things.  She says that she needed to turn over a large part of the soil when she first acquired her land, in order to make better use of the nutrients it contains.  She now needs capital to pay local workers to perform the farm tasks in less time and improve production.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve her income, her husband Raul rented a motorcycle taxi to take advantage of the days when they don't work in the fields.

Zulema is studying at the university for a degree in biochemistry and pharmacology.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe currently works at a pharmacy at a health center in the city of La Paz.  Zulema works every day of the week and also contributes to the payment for services, food, and clothing.  The loan she is requesting will be used for buying and selling medicines that are not stocked in the health center pharmacy.  Zulema will be able to help the people who need these medicines.  \r\n<p>\r\nZulema\u2019s dream is to have operating capital so that she can have enough medicines for the people who need them the most.  She can then feel better about her work.  This is the first time she has requested a loan from IMPRO and Kiva.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1348117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy medicines.
