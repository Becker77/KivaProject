is an entrepreneur.

She lives with her husband and children in the S\u00e9bougou neighborhood, Cercle of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the republic of Mali).\n\nSince she did not attend school, due to social circumstances, Marie Madellene got involved in income-generating activities at a very young age, following her mother who was selling condiments.  After several years of apprenticeship alongside her mother, she ended up conducting several activities by herself (selling clothes and shoes etc.) long before she started selling groundnuts.  Marie Madellene has now been involved in this activity for 18 years and she enjoys a good network of customers.  She owes her strength as a seller to her ability to build customer loyalty, to her reasonable prices and to the good quality of her merchandise.\n\nShe turned to Soro Yiriwaso in order to increase her business and to meet customer demand.  She has been a client of Soro Yiriwaso for the past six years and has already taken one solidarity loan and one individual loan, which have all been duly repaid.  This loan, her second individual loan, will be used to buy 15 bags of groundnuts.  She buys her merchandise from producers, in the town of San.\n\nMarie Madellene sells for cash and on credit to a customer base which mostly consists of women.  Thanks to this loan, she is expecting to make a monthly profit of 60,000 CFA francs, which will help her to take care of the family's expenses and to increase her business.\n\nHer ambition is to build a house.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1349686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Ismoil has been wanting to build a new house for several years, but has been unable to due to a lack of money. Now his son is grown, and Ismoil will soon host a wedding celebration for him. But first they need to build a good house for his son and daughter-in-law to live in. Of course his son also left for Russia this year, but the money he has sent to his father is not enough to build a house.

He is positive this business will succeed because he is determined and will put in all the effort needed.  Che has regular customers who will buy his piglets and chicks, and the demand for stones is very high. The community will benefit from the droppings which will serve as manure, and the chicks and piglets will be used in the community for ceremonial activities.<p>\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, Che will educate his children and the children of his late kid sister and expand his business.

With this activity, the business will succeed because he has been suffering for a while now because of rampant failure of his bike since all the parts are worn out. After buying these parts, the machine will work without problems; thus, he will carry many passengers. With this business activity, the community will benefit from easy movement since he will transport them to their various destinations at cheaper rates, and also drop students at schools.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, he will open a small provision store for his wife in his neighborhood and also save against further depression of the bike. He prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rates and convenient repayment

She lives with her husband and their children in a nuclear family in Hamdallaye Extension, one of the districts in the outskirts of the town of Sikasso. After a number of unsuccessful business ventures, A\u00eessata finally launched herself into buying and selling smoked fish over 20 years ago. She buys her smoked fish by order from her parents in Mopti and then resells them at the Grand Market and on fair days. She is in great demand from her customers for the quality of the fish she presents. \r\n\r\nShe is on her fourth individual loan having repaid three previous loans in full. With this fourth loan she is planning to buy 20 cartons of smoked fish of varying quality. With this loan she is expecting to make a monthly profit of 150,000FCFA. These profits will enable her to contribute to the family expenses and pay the interest on her loan; the balance will be invested in her activity.\r\n\r\nA\u00eessata's ambition is to become a significant trader in the market.

Her partner is Mark, a fish vendor and they have children. She and her partner manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNeslie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nNeslie hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams that her children will finish their studies.

She is married to Joselito, a driver, and mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nPrescilla operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and resell them to foundries, factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPrescilla hopes that her business will expand and dreams of having a better life.

Four years ago, he began running his own building company. His company's service is known to be good and high-quality.

So he is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT, which he will use to purchase building materials, such as roofing shingles, vacuum-insulated windows, and bricks. Using these materials, he can repair his son's house and restore it to its original state, in no time. As a result, his son will be able to live in a comfortable and warm place.

The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. She has been selling clothes at a trade center by renting a stall since 2007. Before this job, she was working as a saleswoman for another person. Her husband works on contract with an oil extracting company. Her elder child studies at the university, while her younger child goes to high school. She is requesting a loan of 1500000 MNT to purchase clothes from China, as she has sold most of her current stock. As a result, she will be able to keep running her business without worrying about an inventory shortage. She will also be able to generate more income for her family, as demand for clothes usually increases during this period of time. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1349323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He did not go far in his studies and hence started to fend for himself and the family when he was still young. Being pushed by the need to survive, he started banana farming on a small scale on his family's land that his parents allowed him to cultivate on. Because he is hard working, he has used his small savings to buy even more land where he is constructing a house. This business has grown, giving him an opportunity to support his family and dependents. He is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 UGX to complete the house that he has been constructing; it will accommodate his family, including his aged parents. In the photograph is Samuel and his father.

She lives with her husband and her children in Sanoubougou I-Kapel Kourou, one of the suburbs of the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nAfter being involved in many unsuccessful activities, Kadidia finally learned to buy and sell goods such as oil (for cooking), Arabian couscous, Maggi bouillon cubes and other various goods.  She has now been involved in this activity for over six years.  She works from home and at her local market where she owns a retail outlet.  Thanks to the quality of her products, she receives a high demand from her customers. \r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the needs of an increasing number of customers, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso over three years ago.  She has duly repaid six previous loans and is now on her seventh loan.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use her loan to buy 25 cans of oil, 15 boxes of Arabian couscous, 15 boxes of Maggi bouillon cubes, 10 boxes of Arawane tea and a stock of condiments.  She orders her merchandise from Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso) and also from local oil factories.  She resells at the local market to a retail customer base.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Kadidia is expecting to make a monthly profit of 190,000 CFA francs which will be used to contribute to her family's expenses, to pay off her loan's interest and also to reinvest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1352004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural

He has a partner and three children.  He is a humble man but has great responsibilities and a lot of respect for his neighbours.  He has been learning to work the land since he was a child, as his parents never sent him to school; Jos\u00e9 was always busy working as a labourer.  Jos\u00e9 lives on a hillside, where the steep incline of the streets makes it difficult to cross.  Jos\u00e9 carries supplies on his back, over to the land he works.  In order to buy his supplies, Jos\u00e9 must walk twenty minutes to the main road where he then takes a thirty minute bus ride.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is applying for a loan from \"Fundaci\u00f3n Campo\" in order to buy eight bags of fertiliser, two gallons of herbicides, 50lb of corn seeds and more supplies in order to grow 14,000m2 worth of corn and 7000m2 worth of beans.  Living in an area which has little access means that it is difficult to travel and only buy supplies in small quantities.  This loan will be a great help as he will have the necessary supplies to use at the correct time, and in the correct amount.  Jos\u00e9 wants to provide his children with an education and to build a brick house, as he currently has a home built of wood and clay.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1349886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy eight bags of fertiliser, two gallons of herbicides, 50lb of corn seeds and more supplies in order to grow 14,000m2 worth of corn and 7000m2 worth of beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-05-15T07:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-14T07:20:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Ovidio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":625.43,"local_amount":625.43,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":625.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088709},{"amount":174.57,"local_amount":174.57,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":174.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215433}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T22:21:33Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:10:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":558760,"name":"Roselyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roselyn is 25 years old and married with two children, one of whom is in school.

She lives in Banoja village, Tskaltubo district, with her husband Niko and two children who are going to school. Zeinab requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nHer family has a mini-bus. Zeinab\u2019s husband, Niko, is driving it on a bus line and earns a monthly income, which is the only source for the family.\r\n\r\nZeinab requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Zeinab has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith her credit, Zeinab will build a greenhouse.
