For the past three years, Nusula has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells rice, juice, cooking oil and beans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Nusula has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more maize flour, rice, cooking oil and juice for the shop to sell, and will help Nusula to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Nusula hopes that in the future she will be able to start up a clothing business. \r\n\r\nNusula is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

He sells the animals at a profit after fattening them for a period of six to 12 months. His clients are different people from the neighborhood who buy the  animals for slaughter. His dream is to buy plots in the nearby trading center and build rental houses which will help him pay university fees for his children without any difficulty.He would like to use the loan proceeds for buying some calves for fattening. His main challenge is that sometimes animals overstay in the farm and when that happens, he loses money. Hillary is a very hardworking and committed gentleman who respects his loan repayment dates. He appreciates the services of the bank and he acknowledges that it is through its financial support that he is what he is now."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1342952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

business.  About a year ago, she began renting a small stall at a local market where she sells her goods such as socks, children's clothing.  In the beginning, Olga was afraid of starting her own business since everyone was talking about the financial crisis.  Now, she doesn't doesn't regret it and is glad she took that step.  She requires a loan of 5,000 hryvnia in order to replenish her inventory at her stall and to buy a new batch of children's socks, pants and shirts.  She plans to improve her business.  Not long ago, she found a better space at the market and hopes, with time, to move and begin selling there once she saves up the money."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1348650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

For about 10 years, Abida has been running a business selling milk. She initiated her own business by buying a buffalo to support her family when her husband was doing a peon job. With the passage of time, her sales increased and also her income. This has all happened due to her courage and determination. Because of her work, she is respected in her home. She helps her husband in all family matters as well as financial matters. \r\n\r\nWhile talking to the Kashf officer, she shared the feeling of achievement she got by sending her son to college for further studies.

Zeny will invest the 1500 soles in the purchase of products such as rice, sugar, milk, spices, and more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1351299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products such as rice, sugar, milk, spices, and more","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Bellavista","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-15T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-14T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":214.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":240.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":249.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":251.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":268.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":275.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86,"local_amount":214.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":223.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975597},{"amount":96.04,"local_amount":240.11,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":249.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996866},{"amount":99.74,"local_amount":249.36,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":259.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864338},{"amount":100.46,"local_amount":251.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":261.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352709},{"amount":107.46,"local_amount":268.63,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":279.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904474},{"amount":110.3,"local_amount":275.76,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":286.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090527}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T00:25:57Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":556974,"name":"Abena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abena is a small-scale fruit vendor in Dompoase (near Cape Coast).

She has been running two businesses, one selling charcoal and the other a broiler business. She is in these businesses for six years. She works from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily and is able to make a good profit per month. \r\n\r\nThis will be Maua's sixth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. With the previous loans, all of which were repaid successfully, she restocked on charcoal  and started her broiler business. With the returns received, she paid school fees and household expenses.

We have two beautiful sons ages 7 and 2. I also have 5 brothers, all of them are married. Both my parents died, which made me a very strong person and at the same time value everything that I have. My husband Javier drives a taxi, so we both bring income to support or family.\n\nI have a small local where I sell candies. Occasionally I go selling door to door or outside of schools.  I stoped selling cosmetics five months ago, because I didnt have money to buy inventory, but now I want to get back to selling cosmetics because I already have some recurring clients, but I will continue to sell candies. I will use the loan to buy cosmetics and candies, that way I will be able to increase sales and benefit my family. \n\nMy biggest business accomplishments have been able to buy a car and start a small business.\n\n\n\n\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1352127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

Beauty Salon, a full-service, family-oriented barber shop and beauty salon that offers both the traditional services found in many chain hair salons, and a number of unique touches that help it stand apart from the San Antonio competition. These include spa services (manicures, pedicures, etc.) and hairstyles such as tapers, edge-ups and perms. \r\n\r\nAs the company\u2019s owner, Bianca established a firm mission to provide the highest quality services at affordable prices. Friendly and knowledgeable staff and an inviting environment are trademarks of the Wavvy brand. Bianca feels that these are the components that will keep her clients returning to the salon time and time again.\r\n\r\nIn the process of developing her business plan, financing was the one major roadblock Bianca encountered. But she didn\u2019t let that deter her. While doing research online about financing options, Bianca came across the Accion Texas Inc. website. She reached out to the lending staff and worked with them to qualify for a loan to launch her business. Now Bianca can purchase new equipment, as well as create a website to complement the social media components that are essential to her marketing strategy.\r\n\r\nBianca is thrilled to take the first step towards opening the Wavvy Barber and Beauty Salon. She has defined concrete goals that she would like her business to accomplish, including the addition of 10 full-time employees who will embrace the Wavvy mission and help it reach its revenue goals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5450,"image":{"id":1350039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She has five children, four of whom are still dependent on her as they are still in school. Like the rest of her neighborhood, she does rice farming. The four hectares of rice growing has returned her about 15,000 Riels (KHR) per day. Including this loan, she is a third-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva's partner).

The current business, in which she has been involved for 20 years, has returned her about 38,000 KHR per day. This is not the first loan for Phally with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The past six cycles have returned her a positive impact, allowing her to upgrade her living conditions at a good pace. She also has completely repaid back her past loans with success. Now, she joins a group of two to apply for a new loan. Her requested loan amount is 1,400,000 KHR while the other member is applying for 1,000,000 KHR.

Even at a young age she liked the field of healthcare and wanted to be a great doctor or nurse. When she finished school, she gave birth to her daughter and had to wait a year to study. For economic reasons, she was not able to study medicine, so studying to be a licensed practical nurse seemed like a good start. Time passed, and after her daughter reached 6 months of age Alejandra started to work because she needed to earn money to study. She started working at a bar and saved all the money she could. After a year of working, she searched on the internet for schools where she could study to be a licensed practical nurse. She had never heard of Campo Alto, but an old friend who had completed the same degree there found out that she was looking for schools and highly recommended Campo Alto. So, Alejandra went there to look around and ask about what she would need, and she liked it a lot. That was when she decided to start studying there.\r\nBefore she started she had to think about who would care for her daughter. Being a young mother, her parents have always supported her with her studies, but they weren't able to take care of her daughter. Alejandra enrolled her in daycare, and this took a lot of work.

Cirila works raising and selling farm animals, like goats, cows, hens, and more. She says that this is difficult, full-time work, because she always has to look after her animals. She is asking for this loan to buy feed for her animals and also to buy small animals to raise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4950,"image":{"id":1339819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy feed and small animals to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Curuguaty","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2013-05-16T22:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-15T22:30:01Z","loan_amount":4950,"lender_count":151,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorgelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":20531220,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3421870},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3421870},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3421870},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3421870},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3421870},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3421870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":3421870,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3431310.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372930858},{"amount":1650,"local_amount":6843740,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:20:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6862621.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381707893},{"amount":825,"local_amount":3421870,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3431310.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390570271},{"amount":825,"local_amount":3421870,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3431310.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400809942},{"amount":825,"local_amount":3421870,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3431310.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410095429}],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T15:49:02Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T13:31:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":559303,"name":"Nancy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group consists of four members who reside in Dansoman.

Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources and because of the necessity to get a job at a very young age, German was unable to study business administration as he had wanted. In his free time, he likes to walk in the fields and he sometimes cooks delicious fried rice.\r\nOn his own initiative, with great hard work and dedication, German works in livestock. He has a small number of animals - rams, sheep, goats, and others - which he raises to later sell in the city markets. German works every day for approximately ten hours and believes that it is going well for him because of his experience and his kind treatment of others.\r\nGerman is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he will be able to improve his home's hygienic services.

Frustrated, the 35-year-old wanted to start over with a new career.  Searching for a new business idea, Carlos found apps and it felt like home. \n\nMyriad Co. began in June 2011, developing cell phone applications. One product, Fishing for Words, is an app inspired by Carlos\u2019 love for fishing.  He even has professional fisherman Bill Dance sponsoring the project to promote awareness.  The app is similar to the well-known game, Words with Friends, but with a twist.  The major difference will be that Fishing for Words will have a dictionary to define words, a rating system, 15- and 30-minute game timers for those looking for a short game and it can be played in Spanish, Japanese and French.\n\nWorking in his hometown of Memphis, Tenn., Carlos already has an app on the market, an automatic-reply app for Android called Autovoxt. Carlos says he wanted a job where he could relax and still get paid, and once he saw the demand for apps, \u201cI saw the vision and I studied the market.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo one taught me. The Internet and Google are your best tools,\u201d he says.  However, a background in computers helped. Carlos works as an IT administrator at a hospital where his coworkers are familiar with his side job. One co-worker advised him to visit Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), a local free confidential counseling nonprofit organization for start-up businesses seeking advice, in Memphis, for financial support. \n\nThey referred him to Accion Texas Inc.  He used the Accion loan to finish the Fishing for Words app process, but mainly to create business cards and posters that have the app logo and instructions on how to download it. \n\n\u201cMy goal is to get 10,000 downloads the first week,\u201d he says. \n\nHis long-term goals are to hire those he contracts with in United States, Japan and India. \u201cWe have plans, if this expands, then these people will come under my umbrella. They\u2019ll move to Memphis and be my employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat separates the market is what separates Apple from PC. I have lots of ideas for apps. I compare myself to Myspace and Facebook. Myspace began the need for social media, but Facebook revved it up,\u201d he says. \u201cApps begin with the ideas. It\u2019s not so much about the company but the person.\u201d\n\nFishing for Words can be downloaded for iPhone and Android, including computers, tablets, and Facebook.\n\nVisit his developing website at www.fishing4words.com\/ and his Facebook page at: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Fishing-For-Words\/146730425437084.\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1343786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Entertainment","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"to finish his project and advertize it.
