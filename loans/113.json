She is married and has three children -- a girl and two boys. Two of her children are currently in the primary school. The last born, however, is yet to start school. She says her husband has travelled abroad for greener pastures. She lives with the children in a rented apartment in a town called Dormaa Ahenkro in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. Dormaa is an agricultural-dominated town. It is about a 45 minute drive from Sunyani, the regional capital. Gifty sells eggs to make some income to provide for the family.

in Kandal province. The members of this group will use the loan for various purposes. Mrs Saran P. is 60 years old and the village bank president. She is a mat maker and owns her own business. Since her business is doing well, she wants to expand it but she does not have enough money to buy the necessary raw materials to make the mats. In order to deal with this problem, she decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She hopes to improve her family's living conditions with this loan. Mrs Saran P. has three children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while the other is a farmer. \r\n<p>\r\nNineteen members in this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. In EoT loans, the borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

people, Elena and her 74 years old husband are used to be farmers since they were young. Parents of both were also farmers and that was their main source of income then. Elena has inherited a rice field from her parents however, she didn't have enough capital to maximize the land for a rice production (rice planting) business or any agriculture business. A piece of it was pawned to other people in the village to finance her only child's education until her graduation from college. In 2003, Elena decided to join Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI)and get a loan to finance her rice production business that had started in 1999. She also dreamed then to get back the land they pawned.\n\nEventually after Elena's seventh times of loaning from ASHI she has able to have savings and have made their farming business grew. Her 35 years old only child who lives with her and her husband has been so supportive to her. Her loan presently which is intended for getting back her pawned land and finance her rice production business, is supported and agreed upon by her family. They promised each one that they will be helping each other for Elena to be able to payback her weekly payment in ASHI on time.   \n\n

It was a key post along the Silk Road and was once ruled by Alexander the Great. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He carries out these activities according to the seasons in his area, since usually there are only two: winter, when he establishes his crops, and summer, when he secures the food supply for his livestock. These activities take up most of the hours of his day. He has received financing for seven loans, which he has used to expand his livestock herds and improve his production system, from simpler methods to more technologically advanced ones. With the current loan, he plans to buy three more cows, so that he can increase his production of milk and meat and thus provide improved sustenance for his family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":512710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying three dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Somotillo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10498.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201258113}],"funded_date":"2010-05-19T04:13:36Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":192145,"name":"Leonarda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonarda tiene 52 a\u00f1os, vive con sus 3 hijos en su casa propia.

For 15 years, she has made a living selling prepared meals from a stand at the city's main market.  That's where she starts work every morning, providing breakfast and lunch to her loyal customers, all of whom are eager to enjoy the traditional dishes that Leonarda prepares for them.  Her children help her sometimes, waiting on customers, because this is a business that requires a lot of hard work.  To make the money she needs, she has to get up at 4 in the morning to prepare her meals, but she's learned to win over her customers with good seasoning and attentive service that have helped to keep the business profitable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  charcoal sales, vegetable vending and farming. Her husband Orlando, who is 38 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 10 and 11 years old. Mercelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy more stock so that she can continue to save up for her children\u2019s education & household improvements. Mercelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

In the small village of Sadova he works hard to care for his bees and to use their precious production as efficiently and creatively as possible. A Peace Corps volunteer originally helped him research and set up the foundation of his project several years ago and Petru has not stopped learning and experimenting since. Right now, for example, he is working on a new system for the wooden frame that holds the beeswax foundation inside the hive. Currently his operation has two branches: honey production and candle making. The former involves much attention to the health of his bees. In the spring and summer he takes his hives to the forest above his town to allow the bees to find nourishment from different varieties of trees as they come into season, thus creating differentiated honeys as derived from certain blossoms (separated according to the time period in which the bees were feeding). The honey is sold at the local markets as well as in stores, but it is difficult in Moldova to have a good and steady income from honey sales alone so Petru realized that diversification was important. The candle making side of the business entails many steps, starting with finding a steady supply of good wax. Petru wants to generate more of his own high-quality wax since the stock he recently purchased was in large part impure and brittle, but doing so will take some time and require expansion; he would like to work up to a larger scale, hopefully with around 100 families of bees. He works with his family, especially with his daughter who loves painting the finished candles with special paints to make them even more ornate, and sells the candles at stores specializing in crafts and decorative goods. Many local churches also buy tall alter candles from Petru since they know that he only uses high quality wicks and that the candles will burn well. Petru would now like to purchase more hives, to buy a stock of sugar-derived nutrition for wintertime feeding and to buy a supply of finer wax to ensure superior candles for his customers to use in the holiday season.

Daniel will use the money to buy coffee plants, which are very expensive at the outset but very productive over time. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":231168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For the purchase of coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T02:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":463.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210607}],"funded_date":"2008-12-01T20:40:49Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Sultan","image":null}},{"id":80694,"name":"Juana Auxiliadora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy pieces of timber to make furniture for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cresensia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130777},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027566},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613567},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010646},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232932},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664725},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105449},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022594},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867843},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757044}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T05:17:02Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Chang","image":null}},{"id":92982,"name":"Marlon Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Marlon vende juntos con su mama granos b\u00e1sicos, productos de cosm\u00e9ticos y refrescos, el tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en el barrio el pilar en la ciudad de Managua, el vende desde que tiene 15 a\u00f1os ayudaba a sus padres y inicio con ayuda de su mama, para obtener sus propios ingresos, y poder mantener a su familia ya que su esposa le tiene dos hijo uno de 4a\u00f1os y el otro de un mes de nacido.

Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow five times through the CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to add stock to her store. Her business lets her earn a profit of about $200 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for an 8,000 PHP loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying prime commodity products.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her store could eventually become a mini-grocery and prays for a peaceful and blessed family life. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a 49-year-old widow and has six children who are 26, 26, 22, 14, 11 and 7 years old.  Four of the children go to school.  Carolina only finished sixth grade and did not continue school because of her parents' financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house with her family and supports her mother and granddaughter who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe has never left her hometown.  For more than 11 years, Carolina has worked as a teacher for the Ministry of Education.  She has no employees and has a salary of 4,500 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also saves some of this money in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks and learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is Carolina's third loan.  She is asking for 10,000 meticais, which she will use to buy construction materials (sand, stone, zinc sheets, cement and other items) to finish building her house.\r\n\r\nCarolina promises to pay off this loan on time to maintain her credit.  In the future she would like to ask for more loans to build rooms for rent.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

When she was a girl she sold cakes door to door. \r\n\r\nHowever, with time and savings she was able to buy her things and make her own desserts and cakes in her house.  She has a lot of customers.  The reason that she requested the loan is to be able to rent a spot to be able to sell her cakes there.  She wants the people who go to the town of San Juan del Progresso to taste her cakes and come back to see her.  \r\n\r\nShe would like to use her earnings to make one of the best pastry shops in San Jos\u00e9 del Progreso.  She wants this in order to have a better quality of life for her and for the people who she loves the most.  That would be her husband, Pablo, and her children; Brenda, Miriam, Lourdes, and Gustavo.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda del Carmen-sells shoes\r\nElena \u2013sells food\r\nCatalina-to sell food\r\nBertha-to buy and sell clothes\r\nTeodora-to buy materials to make tortillas\r\nFabiola-sells footwear\r\nCelia- to sell clothes\r\nEleazar-will buy brickmaking materials\r\nManuel-will buy materials for the fields\r\nBeatriz-to buy chicken\r\nBrenda-to buy and sell shoes\r\n\r\nAll of the members of the Jos\u00e9 de las Juquilitas group give thanks to the team of workers at the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support they have given them. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4675,"image":{"id":794944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make pastry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Jose del Progreso;

She lives with her family in a two-bedroom house in Ntahbessi, a quarter in Nkwen, in the Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nTsiagu is a very committed and hardworking business lady who owns a store in the Nkwen market. Her hard work and commitment have earned her many customers who demand a variety of goods which she cannot stock with her minimal capital. With the help of a loan from GHAPE, she will be able to stock foodstuff like maize, beans, rice and groundnuts which are in high demand. She really believes that this business will be successful because she already has many customers, and has a committed and hardworking spirit.\r\n\r\nHer business is helpful to the community because she will increase the variety of goods in the market, making things readily available at moderate prices. She has been through some tough times in her life, such as the death of loved ones, ill health and poverty (which made it difficult to educate her children). \r\nWith the profit from her loan, she will be able to educate her children very well, and to feed, clothe and provide medication for them.\r\n\r\nShe  prefers a GHAPE loan because of the low interest rates, and also because of the training the staff offers. The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community in its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":870035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives with two of her 6 children.  For more than 15 years now, she has made a living in agriculture and livestock.  She has enjoyed living in the countryside and breathing clean air since she was very young.   This is why she decided to make her home there and raise her six children.  Today, she only lives with her two youngest who also help her take care of the farm.  She plants potato, corn, and alfalfa which she sells at the market, and also uses to feed her livestock.  She owns two properties; in one of them she plants while the other rests for several months so that the earth recovers its nutrients and can yield a good crop once it is cultivated again.  This is how she works; she also works with her livestock, especially her cow, which she takes to far off pastures to feed in addition to the alfalfa she gives her to eat.

This community was destroyed by the civil war, so people live in old and burnt houses.\r\n\r\n Emmanuel\u2019s business is brick making. He molds bricks and sells them retail to those that are into renovation, since Lynch street was destroyed by the civil war. \r\n\r\nAfter making bricks during the daytime, Emmanuel\u2019s night business is operating his little tea shop. He also serves as a photographer to the residents of Lynch Street. Emmanuel started as a brick contractor and raised some money which he used to start up his own business and he has been working at this business for 9 years. He always has goods on hand and sells at an affordable price, so him has a lot of customers.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel\u2019s main difficulty is during the rainy season when the rain damages his bricks because he does not have a shelter. Emmanuel needs this loan to purchase more cement in order to produce more bricks that can serve his customers and also to build a shelter to work under and that can also protect his bricks. He hopes to have a big business, if possible a company in the future.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel dreams of having access to funds that can help other people through his

He has requested this loan from Juhudi for 40,000 KES to expand his poultry project. His biggest challenge in this business has been the fluctuation in the market price of their produce and the high cost of drugs and poultry feed. He believes that this loan will help him expand his project, hence increasing his overall produce, which will earn him more income and enable him to educate his children. In the future he hopes to set up a store that will be a major supplier of eggs in the area.\r\n<p>\r\nHe says that he is \"grateful to Juhudi for empowering him

","en":"Abdilat is a 57 year-old farmer, living with his family in the Alike village in the south of Kyrgyzstan.  Abdilat used to work as a driver at an auto park, but his salary did not allow him to cover his family expenses, so he decided to open his own business of animal husbandry and farming.  Thanks to his persistence and hard work, Abdilat's business that started with 20,000 som (KGS), now brings in about 20,000 som (KGS) per month from the sales of dairy and meat products.  Earnings from the business allowed him to make repairs at home and hold weddings for his children.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Abdilat requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase cattle and sheep.  He plans to invest the profits from this loan into further increasing livestock quantities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":931898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle and sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alike village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-29T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdilat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":12546.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250616},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":12546.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072191},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":12546.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339018},{"amount":1343.75,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":62734.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329624}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T12:03:43Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":368411,"name":"Ronald","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronald is 28 years old.

Tamarakhan worked as an accountant at the local collective farm, and is now retired. In 1981, in search of an additional source of income for her family, Tamarakhan started her own business in animal husbandry with a starting capital of 10,000 somi (KGS). Thanks to hard work and perseverance, Tamarakhan's farm now brings in about 5,000 somi per month. To increase her quantity of livestock, Tamarakhan has come to Bitushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 somi (KGS) to purchase more livestock and forage. This will enable her to expand her farm and increase the quantity of livestock, thus making it, in her view, the best capital

He is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who has a great desire for improvement.  Unfortunately due to a lack of economic resources and a need to work to pay his expenses he was unable to study for a professional career, although he would have liked to do so.  In his free time he likes to go fishing with his friends and sometimes cook a delicious \"lomo saltado\" [a Peruvian beef dish] to share with his family.  On his own initiative, and with great effort and dedication, Jorge works as a taxi driver providing transportation services.  He works every day starting early in the morning, and can work for about 10 hours.  He is happy doing his work and believes that it is going well for him because he knows the most popular areas and because of the friendly service that he provides to his customers. Jorge is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help they are providing he will be able to buy tires and do general maintenance on his vehicle.  Thus he will have his work tool in better condition and can serve more customers.  He will then be able to continue working and trying to get ahead, to achieve his great dream of owning his own house."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1185455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy tires and pay for maintenance of his vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":117.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":177.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":169.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":181.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":183.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":194.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":198.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":205.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":217.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":222.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":233.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":240.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":249.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":264.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":269.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":281.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":290.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":301.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorna Gladman","image":733132}},{"id":577801,"name":"Fatou","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"La  dame   Fatou   est  mari\u00e9e  et   habite  au  S\u00e9n\u00e9gal    depuis  plusieurs   ann\u00e9es.   \nElle     \u00e9volue   dans   le   secteur   des  services et exerce l\u2019activit\u00e9 de femme de m\u00e9nage   depuis  bient\u00f4t  2 ans.

Biasanya suku cadang kendaraan bermotor yang dijualnya dia beli di kota Denpasar atau ada juga yang dibeli dari sales person yang menjadi langganannya. Dari usaha ini, ia bisa menyisihkan uang untuk membayar perpanjangan kontrak rumahnya dan juga dipakai sebagai modal lagi. Elly berkeinginan mengembangkan tokonya, karena itu dia membutuhkan tambahan modal lagi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":158728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional Funding for Business (Menambah Modal Usaha)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-05-11T20:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-25T23:02:14Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-06-15T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":413952.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238592},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-07-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":413952.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":267473},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-08-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":413952.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":296672},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-09-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":413952.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":327288},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-10-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-31T07:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":413952.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":360788}],"funded_date":"2008-05-11T23:02:14Z","paid_date":"2008-10-31T07:14:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":52035,"name":"San","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. San M., and his wife, Mrs. Phan Long were married in 1980.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They live in a humble house that they own; the house is quite old, and three generations of their family have lived there.\r\n\r\nThe self-sacrificing work that Carmen carries out every day has made her appear older than her true years. She works as a farmer, growing potatoes, peas, corn and gladiolus flowers for the past 10 years, with her husband's help. What she likes best is growing peas, because they do not require a large investment, and they can be harvested up to 3 times. \r\n\r\nCarmen considers farming a profitable activity, because it allows her to cover her household expenses and obtain the basic necessities for everyone in her family. In the future, she would like to open a food store in the city, and she is already looking for a suitable building to rent for this purpose. However, Carmen does not intend to stop farming; on the contrary, she wants to increase her production. \r\n\r\nThis is Carmen's third loan with MFP, and she likes to work with the members of her communal bank, because of their strong unity and solidarity. To cover the expenses of this farming season, and in pursuit of greater economic returns, she will invest the funds she is currently requesting to purchase a bag of pea seeds, two sacks of fertilizer, and a bottle of insecticide. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":476390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-24T18:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1211.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672798}],"funded_date":"2010-01-24T20:44:38Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":175369,"name":"Gift","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gift sells colorful sarongs at retail prices to her customers.

As such, she is viewed by many women in her community as a role model. Grace is a widow with six children. Five children are in secondary school, and one is working as a teacher. She is a high school dropout and hasn\u2019t undergone any training.\r\n<p>She started her business in 1994 to support her family and school-going children after her husband died. This is her second loan with PEMCI, but her first with Kiva. The first loan of $150 was used to equip her meat shop with essential equipment. With this second loan of $300, she plans to diversify her business into buying and selling cereals such as maize, beans, millet and other fodders. \r\n<p>Through her business, she has been able to promote her church's women's projects in the community. The women's groups are able to plant and export cereals. With time, other members of their A.C.K. church's women's group have been able to gain knowledge and skills and can now impart the skills in their own farms. \r\n<p>Grace is well educated for her community and is concerned in the uplifting of women's affairs. We see her as a key resource person for any other future interventions that PEMCI may wish to undertake with its partners in these communities. Grace is well-worth the support of Kiva partners.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":21368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase animals for slaughter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Angurai, Teso District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":27,"posted_date":"2007-03-27T22:38:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliet Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-11T03:13:52Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-06-11T09:16:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":22263},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-07-11T09:17:17Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":30973},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-08-11T09:18:01Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41290},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T09:17:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53106},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T09:18:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65882}],"funded_date":"2007-03-28T03:13:52Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T09:18:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11086,"name":"Parinaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parinaz lives in Beylagan.

They are living in his uncle\u2019s house.  When he was 15 he started helping his father in his work as an artisan.  His father wove blankets, and now Victor is doing the same.  He gets up at 3:00 a.m. to work on his weavings.  During the day he sells clothes.  He only sells during certain times of the year when he can take advantage of the demand because what he likes is weaving.   This has allowed him to pay the home expenses, but he has also had some bad times when his textiles did not sell.  Now his wife sells what he makes.  She works as a street vendor at city fairs on Thursdays and Sundays.  The goal this couple has is to have their own stand to avoid being moved from one place to another during their sales.  This is Victor\u2019s first loan with MFP.  He promises to make all of his payments on time.  He wants to work together as best as he can to help his community bank.  The loan is to buy processed wool and synthetics for his weavings.  Because there is high demand at the beginning of classes, he will also buy school uniforms to sell.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":292701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T22:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"V\u00edctor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1862.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123940}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T22:35:00Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":101222,"name":"Chanthy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chanthy S., 35, and her husband, Mr. Yoeurn Khiev, 42, who live along National Road Number One, about thirty-five kilometers from Phnom Penh, were married in 2006 and have no children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is the big reason why he wants to get on in life. They all live in a house which was given to him by his parents.\r\n\r\nJhonatan works in transportation. Through hard work he managed to acquire a motorbike which he has used to transport the public for three years and thus earn money to support his family. However, his work isn\u2019t as easy as it seems. It requires a lot of physical effort to be able to drive the bike through the streets of his neighbourhood, many of which are made of sand. He has got stuck many times.\r\n\r\nAs for the future, Jhonatan is thinking of opening a motorbike repair workshop with a partner as he has gained a lot of experience in this line of work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 34 years old and married; although, she is currently separated from her husband. They have been blessed with three children, all of whom attend school. To make a living, Shiela sells fish. She has been engaged in this kind of business for the past five years. She currently earns an average of more than 15,000 PHP per month.  \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shiela Alona joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Shiela Alona is an active member of Paglaum MPC under the Regular Loan Program and has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP. She is now requesting a loan of 40,000 PHP, which will be her third loan. She will use the loan as additional capital for her existing business selling fish.

While Lugazi is not anywhere near the food basket districts of Uganda, many of the indigenous people there have recently embraced commercial farming though most of it is on a small scale. Many natives principally grow sugar cane. The two sugar cane factories in the district provide a market for most of these sugar cane farmers. Recently however many natives have taken to growing other cash crops such as bananas, cassava, maize, coffee and cabbage.\r\n\r\nLawrence, who is an affable father of 7 buoyant and high spirited children, says that notwithstanding the high cost of doing business in the country, he remains upbeat about the growth of his business. From the beginning, he found it formidable to obtain a footing in a business which was already highly competitive. Unwavering diligence, determination, perseverance and will power have been Lawrence's magic formula for his fledgling success. \r\n\r\nPrior to taking root in this enterprise, Lawrence was working in a small retail trade. The fact that foods such as bananas, maize and coffee sell highly in the food markets in this part of the country has profoundly emboldened Lawrence. Out of this business on a weekly basis, Lawrence is able to make sales profits to the tune of 400,000 Ugandan shillings. He reckons he will be able to make more than he currently makes if he can apply high grade manure in his farm to ensure good harvests. On the side, he also ekes out additional income from a milk sales business. Lawrence says he is requesting this Kiva loan to purchase high grade manure for his farm. Lawrence\u2019s group is taking its fourth loan from Pearl Microfinance now and their track record in repaying their loans has been commendable.
