She's married and grows coffee alongside her husband and children. This was her parents' means of livelihood and nowadays it's her family's. She has gotten a great deal of experience, because her parents taught her to do farming work when she was very young and she has done that alongside her family for over 40 years. Her customers are middlemen who come to the area, neighbors and other people who sell produce such as coffee. They own the land where they sow. They acquired it with a lot of effort and a lot of work, by saving money and cutting down on several things so they could have a place to sow without having to rent.\r\n\r\nShe's currently requesting help in order to purchase certified seeds, fertilizer, compost, pesticide and a spray pump so that she can grow a bit more coffee. This will increase her profits due to the amount of coffee that will be grown.\r\n\r\nHer plan for the future is to own a large coffee farm which may continue to provide them with blessings and a livelihood for her family. She also hopes that it may be passed down from generation to generation by her children, her grandchildren and the generations to come, as it has been done until now, therefore becoming a family heritage."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1351569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase certified seeds, fertilizer, compost, pesticide and a spray pump in order to grow coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Siguatepeque, Comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1475,"local_amount":28000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":28161.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812888}],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T16:05:54Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:27:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":559858,"name":"Carlos Julio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El clienta Carlos vive en Quevedo.

city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. He has the position of a driver at a private business entity and he has already worked for two years. His main duty is to carry the chief executive officer to his destination. His wife works at a fuel station and his elder son is a second-year student at a university. His younger son goes to high school. The house the family lives in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. So, he is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, fiberglass and foam. As a result, the family can live in a warm and comfortable place. Also, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

Her business gradually started to bear fruit and, although she now has a market stall, she needs to extend to other markets so as to increase her sales, make savings and eventually have a new and bigger shop of her own.  Celia sells her goods for cash or credit 7 days a week from 8am to 5pm and collects the money owed to her on a weekly basis.  She uses this money to make cash purchases in the town centre, where she qualifies for special volume discounts.  This would be far more effective if she had more money to invest.  It is for that very reason that she is applying to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for her first Kiva loan.  She will use it to buy clothing, footwear and other items for women, increase her purchasing power, offer a wider range of goods and, as a result, boost her income.  This is how she intends to make successful use of her Kiva loan.

Yunis obtained business experience from working in a pharmacy where she was in contact with many people who later became her customers.\r\n\r\nNowadays she has a workshop located in her own home which she acquired when her friend became ill. Her friend could no longer run the workshop so sold it to Yunis.\r\n\r\nCurrently Yunis sells both for cash and on account. Her main customers are businesspeople who sell clothing, neighbours, and friends who know the quality of her work and always use her services. She works from 6 in the morning to 8 at night to complete everyone\u2019s orders.\r\n\r\nHer greatest goal is to expand her workshop so that she can help her son get ahead. This is also her greatest challenge. Yunis is now seeking a loan from Kiva, the first time she has approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With the money she plans to buy fabric, thread and other sewing necessities. She will be able to increase production and lower costs through buying in volume, just what the loans are intended to achieve.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1352095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy

He is married and the father of one son. He has been raising seasonal fruits and vegetables for the past thirteen years. He chose this business because it is profitable and because there is always high demand for fresh food. People use fresh vegetables every day and include them in many national dishes, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every family table in Azerbaijan and are often made into fresh punch. Tahir sells his crops in the Sabirabad central bazaar. His monthly income is 400 AZN. His son actively helps him to raise his crops. Tahir also receives a pension.

Leishembi is the featured borrower member, and she is pictured with her hand raised. \r\n\r\nShe is married now with three children. She runs a tea shop and also weaves traditional attire. \r\n\r\nLeishembi's main business is weaving and her woven products are women's wrap-around skirts and traditional shawls. She was making a good profit but her sales entirely depend on the festive season. She makes good sales during marriages, send-offs and other events and sales goes down once it is off season. So she also started running the tea shop in the front yard of her house. \r\n\r\nThe tea shop is near the main lane in the neighbourhood, which adds an advantage for her business. The tea shop is a popular place for all age groups in the neighbourhood. She is jolly and also a very good chef. Elders, women and children love the foods Leishembi prepares. People swarm in the tea shop especially in the morning and at noon time. \r\n\r\nShe serves Puri, chow-mein, smash potato fry and toast. Many school-going children depend on her tea shop for breakfast and she works hard to prepare so the children can eat their breakfasts and be on time for class. Besides running the tea shop, she also weaves at night and also gets finished woven products from other weavers and supplies them for profit to the women vendors at the main market. With both the businesses in hand, Leishembi now has a daily income as well as seasonal income, which enables her to make savings.\r\n \r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase sacks of flour and wheat and a full tin of edible oils for her tea shop. With the profits she will order woven products from other weavers and sell them for profits. Her growth in financial stability since the inception in the group has been huge and beneficial says Leishembi. She has managed to open a bank account and also send her children to private schools for better educational quality. She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the impending financial assistance and support towards the group.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving and tailoring.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1347824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase sacks of flour and wheat, a tin of edible oils and necessary supplies for her tea shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"A.leishembi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A.inaobi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maloti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Y.punimashi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N.shantibala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T18:01:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":559373,"name":"Micah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Micah is 33 years old, married to Beatrice, and blessed with one child.

Since her husband passed away, she takes care of her three children. She takes both the father's and mother's roles and shows strong character.\r\n\r\nShe has continued extensive aquaculture, which she and her husband used to do. She uses the pond that was dug by her husband and his friends and then raises fish in the pond, which is located just across the house. \r\n\r\nManaging the family expenses with the retirement monthly pension of her husband was difficult. In order to supplement the family income, she joined the group and availed loan.  \r\n\r\nShe bought hundreds of fry and twats with her first loan. She also bought feed from the markets called powdered-husk. Since it is an extensive aquaculture, she entirely depends on the natural vegetation of the pond. She usually feeds the powdered husk in smaller quantities at a consistent time. She usually sells the fish to women vendors in the town market when they are full grown. \r\n\r\nShe says there was a time when all the fish died from an unknown cause. She was disappointed, but her love for fish farming urged her to continue raising fish. She says it is multipurpose because she loves raising fish and at the same time it generates income. She uses the profit for her children's education and the rest is used for household maintenance. She also managed to join the group's savings and she is happy to be part of the Sahei Group.\r\n\r\nShe says that neighbours' children and poultry get inside the house perimeter and play in the fish pond. She says it is sometimes rude to chase or chide the children and that eventually creates enmity between neighbours.\r\n \r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase fencing nets for the fish pond. If she can arrange a proper fencing for the fish pond, then she won\u2019t have to worry about the fish in the pond. She says thank you to Kiva and WSDS for the support and says please continue helping us.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, cattle rearing, ginger farming, vegetable selling and a paan shop. The group members encourage one another and support each other in their businesses and also conduct meeting on the second Sunday of every month.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1348789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase fencing nets to keep neighbours' poultry away from the fish pond.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhaineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemvah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jangkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimjaneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T19:16:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":559384,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is 23 years old and runs a bakery business in Tala town.

She is a single mother of three, and her two eldest are in elementary school; her youngest is three years old. Bernarda's mother lives with her and helps her with the children, since Bernarda goes to the fields early in the morning to farm. She sows vegetables (potato, broccoli and cauliflower). One of her brothers lives with her as well; he was the one who taught her to farm years ago. He is her only support. She sells her produce through intermediaries who travel to the area. She also sells to neighbours and friends who know her products. However, as with all crops, there is always risk: plagues and fluctuating market prices.\r\nShe is now requesting a loan to invest in planting potato.

He lives in Khashuri District with his wife, two children and parents, who are provided with a retirement pension. Otar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNowadays, the family does not have a source of income. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nOtar requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Otar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Otar will open a plastic workshop. He will purchase equipment and raw materials and will get orders to make different kinds of plastic materials. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He decided to move to a different city and it was difficult adjusting at first but thanks to God and to his efforts and his wife\u2019s support, he was able to move forward.\r\n\r\nWhat he hopes for now is to stock his business and improve its infrastructure so that he can improve his work and offer more things to his customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Jos\u00e9\u2019s first loan with Kiva.  He happily comments that he\u2019s very grateful for the economic support received and promises to be punctual with his installment payments.  \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s requested 800 soles that he\u2019ll use to buy fruit, bananas and other products he sells in his business; he will also do some structural improvements to it. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1347419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tarapoto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T16:40:04Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":84.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":87.11},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":92.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":97.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":107.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":112.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":117.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.18,"local_amount":84.13,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":89.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530547},{"amount":35.39,"local_amount":87.11,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":92.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975573},{"amount":37.65,"local_amount":92.69,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":98.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996842},{"amount":80.45,"local_amount":198.03,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":210.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352686},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":107.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":114.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904451},{"amount":45.9,"local_amount":112.98,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":120.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090509},{"amount":47.87,"local_amount":117.83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":125.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777285}],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T23:31:27Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":558525,"name":"Milka","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Milka, de 42 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada y tiene 3 hijoscon quienes vive en su casa propia.Milka se dedica a la venta de pescado.

In April, 9 years ago, he set up his own business, having been encouraged to do so by his mother-in-law, who has always been a shopkeeper. She passed on her knowledge to her young daughter who then helped her mother in the business.  When they got married, Luis' wife decided to start selling clothing and underwear, small electrical appliances and footwear, for which there had been a previous demand among her customers.  Their business gradually grew and so Luis used what he had saved from his redundancy pay to expand the business, in which his wife still serves the customers, while he works as an employee so as to generate two incomes and increase his family's wellbeing.  They sell goods for cash and on credit and make purchases in cash in the city of Barranquilla, where the warehouses and distributors offer them the best prices.  Today Luis' great ambition is to see the family business grow even more and that is why he is applying to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for his first Kiva loan, which he will use to buy sets of cookware, small electrical appliances, household goods, clothing and footwear, because sales of these goods are increasing as Mothers' Day approaches.  Luis and his wife want to be ready to rotate their stock for Mothers' Day and that is precisely why their Kiva loan will prove to be a succesful investment.

His wife began selling food items in 2008 and has earned many permanent customers. His eldest daughter is pregnant and currently living with her parents because his daughter's house is deteriorated over the years and his son-in-law is currently repairing the house. But due to lack of finances, the house repair and insulation is not completed. So he is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, planks, cements, fiberglass and foam. Using these materials, he and his son-in-law can complete the house renovations, thus preparing a comfortable and warm place for his daughter and grandchild. The renovated house won't lose its heat and more importantly it will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and thus contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of land where potatoes, maize, and haricot are grown. Also, the family owns a milk cow, which is milked every day to make dairy products. All the products are sold together at the local markets. Family additional income is Aleksi\u2019s father's monthly pension.  \r\n\r\nAleksi requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Aleksi will purchase grocery stock to open a grocery shop. His family will be selling the products from the shop themselves so they don\u2019t have to have the extra expense of paying a salary to the seller. This will significantly increase their profit. He will be reinvesting part of the profit into purchasing more grocery stock in order to have better choices to offer to the clients. The other part, Aleksi will use for covering family monthly expenses and providing better living conditions for them.

She grows vegetables and sells them at the local markets to earn a small monthly income, which is her only source of income. Liana has applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Liana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Liana will start trading in clothes.

","en":"Halima is asking for a loan for the first time. She is a conscientious and hard-working woman. She was born in the countryside. She works as a schoolteacher. Her husband provides tractor services. Her sons work in construction and the income is used to support the family with the necessities. Halima receives a small salary and looks forward to her husband's income, as they have four children.

She sells merchandise that she buys directly from the suppliers and from companies that sell their products through specialized guides. She has fixed clients to whom she offers products with special discounts, which keeps them from looking for better alternatives. Her most popular products are stationery items and home items. She is always trying to increase her working capital in order to respond to her clients quickly. This is just the reason for which she is requesting a Kiva loan, her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will purchase beauty products for women, and other items.

Gogita has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. All of his loan requests were rejected because of his family's low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNowadays the family does not have a source of income except for the small monthly pension of Gogita\u2019s parents. It is hardly enough to buy food for them and according to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nGogita has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business and this has now been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with favorable conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

She started this activity in November 2006, having 15 years of business experience in diverse jobs. Ingrid is the mother of 3 children; she dreams of seeing them become successful people, and they are the driving forces behind her efforts every day in her stationery store. She works from Mondays to Sundays from 6 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon. Her future goal is to increase her sales with internet and telecommunications services making the most of her point of sale, which has a big commercial future.

This is exactly the reason that she is turning to Kiva for a loan.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nDavid has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. He has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and restart-up credit with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to other credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers.\u201d With his loan, David will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built, he plans to sow vegetables. The harvested vegetables will be sold at local markets, which he hopes will increase the family's income.

She is a very kind, hard-working and enthusiastic person who puts her all into getting her family ahead; she has always been both father and mother to her child. Unfortunately, due to lack of economic resources and the need to start working at a very young age to support her parents, Sofia was not able to study and become a professional. In her free time, she likes to watch telenovelas. Sometimes she prepares a delicious stir fry to share with her family.\r\nOn her own initiative, with great hard work and dedication, Sofia works in her small business selling desserts and sweets. She prepares delicious tarts, cakes, alfajores [a type of cookie sandwich made with dulce de leche], mazamorras [A Peruvian jello-like dessert made of purple corn boiled with pieces of pineapple and other fruits] and other sweets. She draws in a good clientele. Sofia works every day and is able to work approximately ten hours a day. She feels good doing her job and believes that it is going well for her because of the good flavour of her dishes and her kind treatment of others.\r\nSofia is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help she will be able to buy ingredients and supplies for making her desserts.

He is married and works as a farmer. \r\n\r\nHe has always liked dairy cattle, so every year when he has good earnings from selling corn, beans, and coffee, he buys a calved cow to increase his number of livestock and his milk production. He makes and sells cheese curd to diversify his income. Everything started when he was 26 years old, when he inherited two plots of land from his father. He later cultivated beans on the land, and that year he obtained good production. With his earnings, he bought his first calved cow. In the following years, he repeated the process, and today he has eight calved cows.\r\n\r\nHis children and wife support him with his agriculture and livestock activities. He sells his products in his town, and he would like to sell them in supermarkets because they would sell at a better price. His goals in terms of his business are to increase his number of calved cows to increase milk production, as well as to increase his production of coffee and basic grains. He has applied for this loan to buy fertilizer, manure, and fungicides to avoid infestation, and to pay for labor costs to maintain the three plots of coffee. He wishes to buy machinery and equipment to facilitate the farm labor, fighting every day for a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1352457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers, manure, and fungicides to avoid infestation, and to pay labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-05-18T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-17T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Alejandro \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1431,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":238.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":238.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":238.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":238.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":238.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":238.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":238.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":241.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837374},{"amount":241.66,"local_amount":238.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":241.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901477},{"amount":249.49,"local_amount":246.22,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":249.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673926},{"amount":234.54,"local_amount":231.47,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":234.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490876465},{"amount":206.88,"local_amount":204.17,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":206.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517586163},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":34.53,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":34.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542563214},{"amount":240.77,"local_amount":237.61,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":240.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579627642}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T09:37:08Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:34:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":559630,"name":"Lilian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilian is a married woman with children, all of whom attend school.

They say that they chose their name after the patron saint of their village, one of the most celebrated in their community.\r\nMagdalena is a member of this group. She tells us that she is 38 and has been married to Lucas for 20 years. Together, they have formed a family. They have three children, of whom only one goes to school because the others are still little.\r\nMagdalena has sold clothing for two years. She tells us that she started her business because her husband is often unemployed and they had many economic problems. She says \"I really like helping my husband with the household costs and our children's education. My earnings allow us to live more comfortably without worrying about finances.\" Every weekend, Magdalena travels to the capital to buy more clothing that her clients order. Every day, she goes out to sell door-to-door in other communities.\r\nMagdalena's only difficulty occurs when clients are very late in paying her. Smiling, she says \"I would also love to have a car to get around more quickly and get my orders in on time.\"\r\nMagdalena is requesting this loan for the purchase of more clothing. She plans to purchase more in-style clothing because it will be easier to sell. Her earnings will help her to cover her household costs, but above all it will pay for her children's education. For Magdalena, her children are the most important aspect of life.\r\nThe group is very happy and grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva for the loan that each of them will receive, since it will be a great help for them in expanding their businesses. Luis will invest in his juice business; Cristina will invest in her grocery store; Elizabeth, Acela, Teresa, and Norma will invest in buying sheep to fatten and sell; Luisa will invest in buying aprons for sale; and Sandy will invest in her school supply store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":1339559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Rioyos Buenavista, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-05-18T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-17T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":4600,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Acela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandy Kenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1725,"local_amount":21000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":21003.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048999},{"amount":1150,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":14002.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840168},{"amount":575,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":7001.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698516},{"amount":575,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":7001.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698517},{"amount":575,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7001.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944793}],"funded_date":"2013-05-19T04:28:17Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T19:06:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":559659,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John operates a general shop and has been in the business for the past 12 years.

Her challenges include transportation and seasonality. Her dream is to buy her own truck to help in the transportation of the charcoal from the villages, and also, to sell on a wholesale basis only. \r\n\r\nShe joined MCDT because of the good customer care exhibited during the training. She stays in her husband's house with access to both electricity and piped water. Her major monthly expenses include school fees. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1351216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a lorry load of charcoal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2013-05-18T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-17T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":156300},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":155500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":121.91,"local_amount":312600,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":315679.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372973513},{"amount":162.55,"local_amount":416800,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":420906.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381753673},{"amount":162.55,"local_amount":416800,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":420906.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390617656},{"amount":203.19,"local_amount":521000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":526132.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399861485},{"amount":162.55,"local_amount":416800,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":420906.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410821535},{"amount":162.25,"local_amount":416000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":420098.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420110971}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T20:32:17Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":561810,"name":"No\u00ebl","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"No\u00ebl est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 41 ans et est mari\u00e9 \u00e0 une marchande du nom de Antoinette.

In particular, they have a 0.6-hectare plot of agricultural land, where they grow maize and haricot (beans). They sell the harvested products at local markets. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKandit requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Kandit has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with \"soft conditions\" to start or restart businesses. The program is targeted to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high risk borrowers because of their low incomes. With his credit Kandit will purchase a milking cow. After purchasing a milking cow, he will be able to produce dairy products and sell them locally. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She has had her business for approximately 6 years. She produces and sells Empanada (a fried dough filled with meat and vegetables). She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying flour, meat, cooking oil, vegetables and other goods. She will use the profits to save and to provide for the needs in her family, and also to reinvest in her cooking business.
