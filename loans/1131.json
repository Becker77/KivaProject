So, Ganbaatar is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT. He will use it to purchase building and insulation materials, such as planks, bricks, cement, fiberglass and foam. Using these materials, he can make an extension, and repair and insulate his house, thus providing more comfortable and warmer accommodations for his family. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and thereby contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual, who strives for a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3525,"image":{"id":1351633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living.

Juliet's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales, every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, in larger quantities. She expects a boost in her business income, as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nJuliet wants to have a bigger income from her business, so she can have their own house.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nCaryl dreams of expanding her business and hopes that her children will finish their schooling.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only in the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but is also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Anita's regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAnita dreams that her business will continue to grow and she hopes for continuous health. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

ind\u00edgena Mazahua, \u00e9l pertenece al grupo Granito de Arena y dice que le pusieron ese nombre al grupo pues para los integrantes los cr\u00e9ditos son como los granitos de arena: poco a poquito hacen un gran cerro y es por eso que \u00e9l y sus compa\u00f1eros aprovechan sus cr\u00e9ditos para mejorar sus negocios. Don Eduardo se dedica a transportar grava, arena, piedra, etc. Para obras en construcci\u00f3n, dice que tiene con esta actividad desde hace m\u00e1s de cinco a\u00f1os y que empez\u00f3 con este negocio porque no le alcanzaba con lo que ganaba de la siembra, aparte que su esposa la tuvieron muy enfermita ya que le dio c\u00e1ncer pero gracias a quimioterapias que le hicieron pudo salir adelante. Don Eduardo platica que a diario se hace de dos a tres viajes (transportando el material de construcci\u00f3n) ya que tiene que salir a otro lado a conseguir la grava o arena que vende a unos bancos de arena que est\u00e1n en el estado de M\u00e9xico y en la poblaci\u00f3n de Ocampo y le queda un poco retirado de su comunidad, pero es donde consigue los mejores precios y as\u00ed \u00e9l le puede ganar algo. Dice que est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para seguir invirtiendo en el material para la construcci\u00f3n y que tambi\u00e9n lo ocupara para darle mantenimiento a su carro de volteo. Las otras integrantes del grupo se llaman Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, Sonia, F\u00e9lix y Marisol ellas invertir\u00e1n sus cr\u00e9ditos en la compra de material para elaborar costuras, en la compra de llantas para un taxi de servicio p\u00fablico, para la compra de ropa para dama y caballero y para la compra de fierro viejo para despu\u00e9s venderlo por kilo.\n\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Don Eduardo is 52 years old. He is a native of the indigenous Mazahua community.  He belongs to the Granito de Arena (Grain of Sand) communal bank. He says they gave the group that name because the loans are like grains of sand: little by little they form a mountain and that is why he and his companions take advantage of the loans to improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nDon Eduardo transports gravel, sand, stone, etc. for construction projects. He says he has run his business for more than five years and that he started it because he was not earning enough from farming. In addition his wife was very ill from cancer, however thanks to chemotherapy she was able to recover. \r\n\r\nDon Eduardo notes that he makes two or three trips every day (transporting construction materials) and has to travel a distance to pick up the gravel or sand that he then sells to some sand dealers in the state of Mexico and in the town of Ocampo. This takes him a bit far from his own community, but that is where he gets the best prices so that he can earn something for himself.\r\n\r\nHe says he is requesting a loan in order to continue investing in construction materials and that he will also use it to do maintenance on his dump truck.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, Sonia, F\u00e9lix and Marisol. They will invest their loans in the purchase of sewing materials, tires for a public taxi service, men and women\u2019s clothing and scrap metal to sell later by the kilo.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1342541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sand, gravel and rocks to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-05-18T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-17T23:40:08Z","loan_amount":3875,"lender_count":124,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":47000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3925.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4380.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4476.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4575.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4675.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4778.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4883.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4990.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5100.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5212.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":323.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":377.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":402.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":429.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1057.99,"local_amount":12832.42,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":12882.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373049001},{"amount":763.39,"local_amount":9259.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":9295.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840170},{"amount":389.23,"local_amount":4721.05,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4739.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698520},{"amount":402.63,"local_amount":4883.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4902.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698521},{"amount":838.16,"local_amount":10166.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10205.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944795},{"amount":423.6,"local_amount":5137.81,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5157.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227878}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T09:30:58Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T20:28:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":559966,"name":"Lolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Lolita.

","en":"Victoria is a 37 year-old single mother with one son. She is a hard-working woman who is also responsible for supporting her mother, who she still lives with. She helps with household expenses while her mother helps care for Victoria's son. Victoria sells bedspreads and shoes of various brands by catalog. She says she learned the business six years ago in order to support her son. She also works in a clothing store where she is paid on commission, but  says that amounts to very little, which is why she learned the business of bedspread and shoe sales. She says that thanks to God, her sales are doing well. She buys her merchandise from authorized distributors in the area where she works. Victoria says that although she only makes a little selling shoes, it helps, so she has kept with her business.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to help her stock some more items for orders she has pending with customers, who she lets pay in installments so that it is not such a burden on them. Viki, as her loved ones call her, says that she really likes working with VisionFund because the repayments are not burdensome, so she has time to get the money together through sales to her customers.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are named Rosalinda, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, and Dora Elia. They will invest in the purchase of feed for rabbits and turkeys, and to purchase natural beauty products, handmade embroidery pieces, and cosmetics for catalog sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":1342583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to sell shoes and bedspreads by catalog","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-05-18T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-17T23:50:04Z","loan_amount":3125,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Elia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2585.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2881.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3009.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3075.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3142.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3211.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3282.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3354.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3428.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3503.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3580.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":294.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":694.94,"local_amount":8450.51,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8461.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373049003},{"amount":500.96,"local_amount":6091.66,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6099.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840172},{"amount":254.64,"local_amount":3096.42,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3100.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698524},{"amount":264.14,"local_amount":3211.88,"processed_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3216.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698525},{"amount":550.9,"local_amount":6698.95,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6707.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944797},{"amount":570.74,"local_amount":6940.17,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6949.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227879},{"amount":288.68,"local_amount":3510.41,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3515.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991745}],"funded_date":"2013-05-19T23:05:22Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":559965,"name":"Rosie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosie is 44 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by fattening pigs in the Philippines.

","en":"Mahmadsharif is a good and hardworking man. He always tries to help the people who need support. Since childhood he has loved playing the role as the driver, and faith led to him providing a taxi service. He has worked with providing taxi services for the local residents for more than three years.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Zakaria is an artisan. He works on private orders on constructions and earns small monthly salary, which is rarely enough for the food for family. Family also has pigs. Pigs will be sold at the local market at a good price and Zakaria will earn additional income.\n\nZakaria requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Zakaria has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Zakaria will start a car washing business. He will purchase essential equipment, and a vacuum cleaner. Zakaria will provide services to his local community members, and hopes to increase the monthly income of the family.

Here she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins.  They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines against the invading Japanese.  Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.  Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, and to pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1351761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

themselves Kinepna Group. Kimneichong is pictured with her hand raised and she is the featured borrower member. She says her participation in the Kinepna Group makes her stronger socially and financially. She also says hope is the driving factor to be successful in life. She is single and lives with her mother, brother and her sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nKimneichong runs a tea shop-<i>cum<\/i>-variety shop in the village where she lives. Her shop is located near her house. She sells a few essential commodities including candles, kerosene, salt, sugar, cereals, matchsticks, cigarettes (exported and local), betel nuts, betel leaves, shampoo sachets, etc. Her tea shop is busy \u2013 especially in the mornings when village elders throng in for chit-chat and to enjoy tea. She also prepares toast and puri in the morning. She wanted to help her brother and sister-in-law with the farm but opted for opening a tea shop and running a variety shop instead because her mother is old now. She manages the household chores and also takes care of her aged mother, so she is better off running the shop because she can stay close to her mother. She gets supplies from the city and sells them in the village at a little higher rate to make a profit. She also supports the family in household financial maintenance.\r\n\r\nHer inception in the group enabled her to join a local investment group where one deposits a monthly saving and the amount can be withdrawn after the completion of a year. Her savings so far are small and she hopes to make larger savings once she can expand her shop by refilling with more stock. With this Kiva loan, she will purchase detergent soaps, detergent powder, rice and edible oils. Her future plan is to be able to run the shop without needing a loan, and she says she will work hard to achieve her plan. She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the support and enabling her to look forward to her plans. She says, \"Thank you, Kiva.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1342806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase stock for her tea shop and variety shop and make a better income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-19T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-18T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhaineilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengboichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahchong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimjalhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-19T12:50:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":560020,"name":"Mustarfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mustarfa is a 51-year-old married man living in Bundibugyo, Uganda, with eight children.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the monthly salary earned by Teimuraz\u2019s father, who is working as an builder at a private building company. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTeimuraz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Teimuraz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Teimuraz will start sunflower production. He will purchase all the needed equipment and raw materials and will start packing bags. He will sell the produced sunflowers at local markets at a good price. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Kenya University. She has 6 children and has been supporting them for 14 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, crops, transportation services, and a personal farming. The photo was taken from her residential house and not from the farm.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is selling milk. Her biggest challenge is crop failure and poor prices for farm produce. Animals on her farm have been given the name of Kageni. Josephine is requesting a loan to construct a zero grazing unit.\r\n\r\nJosephine chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they are the best financier for farmers. Josephine learned about the importance of savings during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees, and the increase in sales from this loan will allow her to pay the school fees.\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Josephine owns a cow, pig, poultry, and a motorcycle but does not own a pump, bicycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, electricity, running water, TV, and DVD but does not have solar power or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

This is 48-year-old Simbiso from Masvingo. She is married with four children and two of them attend school. Simbiso runs a clothing business which sells shoes, skirts, blouses and socks. The business has been operating for 6 years. She says the main challenge being faced is of her debtors failing to pay on time. Simbiso has requested a loan of $1200 to buy tracksuits, jackets, belts and jerseys for resale. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will enable her to improve the welfare of her family.

Her household expenses are very large compared to the business income, because she is facing a lot of financial problems in life.\r\nAs a member of a two person group, Rafeela has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan. With the loan amount her husband would buy new varieties of dresses, shirts, jeans, and suits to attract more customers. His sales would increase and his monthly income and savings would also be increased. With the profit amount Rafeela would purchase her own house.\r\nShe is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for helping her.

When they are not at school, her children help their mother with sales.  \u00c1ngela thinks that this loan will help her to stock-up and to prosper with her customers.  \u00c1ngela's only income comes from the business and from her husband.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1353075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, oil, beans, flour, corn, fizzy drinks, toilet paper and other products.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-05-19T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-18T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela Del Carmen \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":234.07,"local_amount":234.07,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":234.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373166188},{"amount":0.93,"local_amount":0.93,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":0.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837375},{"amount":58.24,"local_amount":58.24,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":58.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860657},{"amount":58.88,"local_amount":58.88,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":58.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349363},{"amount":58,"local_amount":58,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901481},{"amount":58.58,"local_amount":58.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":58.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550611},{"amount":31.3,"local_amount":31.3,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":31.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440022060}],"funded_date":"2013-05-19T15:09:43Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:49:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":560966,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La clienta  vive junto a su esposo y su  hijos de 4 a\u00f1os de edad en casa propia, ella se dedica a la venta de ropa, tiene varios a\u00f1os con el negocio y eso le ha regalado mucha experiencia que le permite obtener las mejores ganancias, el negocio est\u00e1 ubicado en su lugar de residencia, se ha hecho de mucha clientela pues las personas saben que todo es de calidad, a precios accesibles y con un servicio inigualable siempre a la orden y al gusto de los clientes;

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her six children. She loves her family and claims they are her greatest source of strength to get up every morning and work hard to generate an income. Since 2003, she has been working as a tailor. She provides stitching services in her community. Her eldest daughter also helps her in sewing dresses. She has excellent skills and, due to the money she generates, she has managed to provide a better quality of life for her family. Her greatest wish is to expand her business and to buy another sewing machine, as the number of her customers increases day by day. However, because she has only one machine, she cannot easily meet  with all the customer demand on time, and that results in a loss of money and customers. Therefore, she is applying for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to invest in the purchase of a sewing machine, which will allow her to cover the demands of customers more efficiently and to elevate her level of income. With the profits, she will pay the educational expenses of her children. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

She works as a hairdresser from her house, and at the same time she works for a hospital in the cleaning department to insure an extra income source for any sudden family need.\r\n\r\nMaysa is applying for a Youth loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua to buy special hair treatment products and tools. She hopes that one day she will be capable of expanding her own business by opening a separate beauty salon and stop the cleaning work, so she can split her time between her own business and family equally.

He lives in Marneuli District with his wife. Agasin requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is their the agricultural activities. In particular, they have 0.5 hectare of land, where they grow potatoes and tomatoes. They sell the harvested products locally. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAgasin requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Agasin has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family,' Justin said that he will be able to educate his children and to upgrade the family's living standard.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Justin owns the following:  poultry, pump, bicycle.  He does not own:  cow, pig, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household:  mosquito net, running water, TV.

She also owns a plot of agricultural land where she cultivates wheat and potato as well as grows nut, pear and apple trees.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Anahit has insufficient funds to purchase forage and feed the livestock. Therefore, she has requested a loan from SEF International to purchase forage and also two mother pigs and five little pigs.

He sells a variety of products in his store. Presently, he is interested to offer more variety to his customers. However, due to the lack of finances, he finds it difficult. \r\n\r\nTherefore his wife, Nusrat, has requested a loan amount of 30,000 PKR from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to purchase rusk, cake, biscuits, bread, bubbles, and popcorn to sell. This will help him to increase his net income and savings as well.\r\n\r\nWith the profit amount, Nusrat wants to construct her house.

She is married and has 2 children who help with different jobs in the fields, including general maintenance, cutting, and fertilizing the coffee crop.\r\n\r\nShe has completed one grade of primary school but was unable to continue her schooling because her parents didn't have much money and couldn't help her with her studies.  She has worked farming coffee since her childhood and her family continues to do it to this day.  This is their only means of obtaining income, since her parents (who taught her to work the land many years ago) have passed away.  The land that they farm together was inherited from her parents some time ago.  They farm it to cover bills such as food, clothing, education, medicine, etc.  The other piece of land that they own was bought, thanks to their own efforts.  They ride there (3 kilometers from home) every day.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for help to buy fertilizer and manure to help maintain her crop so they can have a good harvest that will give them income and help them continue to invest in it.  Her goals include being able to grow more plants so that she can get more income for her family.  In this way, they will be able to continue investing in their crops and increase their harvest little by little.  The profits are to secure a future for her children and to continue investing in her land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1353209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and manure to help maintain her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-05-19T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-18T21:30:04Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.13,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bricelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.53,"local_amount":10,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390787300},{"amount":69.41,"local_amount":1317.66,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1322.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042119},{"amount":204.95,"local_amount":3890.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3905.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710462},{"amount":536.83,"local_amount":10190.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10229.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812890},{"amount":660.15,"local_amount":12591,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":12638.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.13,"payment_id":517523781}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T00:10:42Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":560557,"name":"Tanveer's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tanveer is a 39-year-old woman.

Her biggest challenge is animal diseases. Her animals on the farm have not been named.\r\nNancy was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan to purchase a dairy cow to which she replied that Juhudi works with farmers.

This loan will benefit her family by allowing her to earn more income thus giving them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Nancy owns a cow but does not own a pig, poultry, a pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV,  or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

His experience came from working many years at a local furniture renting company in Del Rio as a sales associate but eventually received a promotion to store manager.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Oscar\u2019s wife operates the store during the day and he joins her evenings and weekends after he completes his shift at Ram Country Toyota where he is employed full-time as a sales associate.  Oscar continues to work full-time at Toyota to provide for his family and the new business.\r\n\r\nYour Store Rent-To-Own offers customers the flexibility to rent furniture, electronics, and appliances at low prices with the option to purchase.  The store also offers great customer service and high quality products for their customers.  Oscar and his family enjoy giving the opportunity to his community the chance to buy a wide array of quality home furnishings.  \r\n\r\nOscar was referred to Accion Texas Inc. by the Small Business Development Center in Del Rio to inquire about applying for a loan.
