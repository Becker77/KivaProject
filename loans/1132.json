She has three children and has been doing this work for 21 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, crops and her personal business.\r\n\r\nSusan stated what is most enjoyable about farming, \"The returns I get from the work I do.\"  Her biggest challenge is, \"Getting the right breed when doing artificial insemination.\"  Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Kilindi, Mzungu, Bahati.'\r\n\r\nSusan was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Juhudi has favorable terms.\"   Susan was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session and she said, \"They support farmers in doing agribusiness.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming.  When asked how will this loan benefit her family, Susan replied \"Income from the sale of milk will cater for her family's needs.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.  Susan owns the following: 'cow, poultry, pump, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, electricity, TV, DVD' but does not have 'solar power, running water or a sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

She lives in the small village of Gurjaani. Marine requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start up a family business but did not have any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of her low income and their family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMarine's retirement pension is her only source of income. According to Credo estimations, she belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Marine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

The members operate a variety of businesses, including the sales of quilts, bed sheets, fruit, and fish; a bakery; the decoration of footstools; and the crocheting of blankets.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit the microbusinesses of which Alicia is one member.

His loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nThe family does not have a source of income. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nJemal requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Jemal has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of a business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Jemal will purchase grocery inventory to open a grocery shop. He already has a commercial space ready to open a shop. After purchasing the inventory the family will start working in the shop themselves to decrease the expenses of paying salary to somebody else. This will increase the profit. Part of the profit they make will be used for reinvesting in the same business, in order to have a better variety of merchandise to offer to the clients and another part will be used for the family's well being.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1352699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

For the past 2 years, Joan has been working hard to manage her poultry farm, which sells chicken. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Joan has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more poultry chicks to sell, and will help Joan to generate greater profits and improve her family's standards of living. Joan hopes that in the future she will be able to expand on the poultry farm and add more chicks. \r\n\r\nJoan is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

He lives in the village of Tetritsklebi, Telavi District with his wife and two children (12 and 17 years old). David requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have four milk cows and a plot of agricultural land, where apple trees are grown. The cows are milked every day to make cheese. Harvested apples and cheese are sold locally at the markets and the family gets a small monthly income. This is the only source of living for them, which is rarely enough for covering the food expenses.  \r\n\r\nDavid requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. David has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, David will purchase chicks. He will raise the chicks and sell them later at a higher price to earn a good profit. Part of the profit David will use to reinvest in the same business and develop his farming. Another part will be used to cover family monthly expenses and provide for his children's future studies.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1352725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To purchase chicks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tetrtsklebi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":502.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107582},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":502.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255126},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":502.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019269},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":502.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670406}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T13:45:13Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:09:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":560673,"name":"Evangeline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evangeline is applying for a new loan of PHP 30,000 to buy ingredients for her food business.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and the salary from her job.\n\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Farming is enjoyable apart from being a major source of income' Her biggest challenge is 'Weather flactuation, price descrimination, high input prices..' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Chemobet.'\n\nGladys was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Was introduced to Juhudi Kilimo by a group member.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How one could benefit from an Micro Finance Institution to boost capital and repay the loan with ease.'\n\nGladys's highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit her family', Gladys replied, 'Will be able to increase acreage for more production.'\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Gladys owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1351894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To improve her horticultural farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.59,"local_amount":2207,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2317.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516904},{"amount":28.32,"local_amount":2265.34,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2378.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960520},{"amount":29.07,"local_amount":2325.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2441.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820179},{"amount":29.83,"local_amount":2386.68,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417275},{"amount":30.62,"local_amount":2449.77,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2572.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980824},{"amount":31.43,"local_amount":2514.53,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2640.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880792},{"amount":32.26,"local_amount":2580.99,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2710.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529434},{"amount":18.12,"local_amount":1449.22,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753375},{"amount":147.76,"local_amount":11821.25,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":12412.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467943795}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T06:29:47Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T13:32:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":560676,"name":"Anaclita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anaclita is involved in a kalamay making business in her place in Albur, Bohol.

She is married and has two children who are currently both in school. For the past two years, Doreen has been working hard to manage her small knitting business, which makes knit sweaters. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Doreen has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more thread to knit sweaters to sell, and will help Doreen to generate greater profits and improve on her family's standard of living. Doreen hopes that in the future she will become a very rich businesswoman in town and also start supplying schools with sweaters. \r\n\r\nDoreen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Phiona has been working hard to manage her small business, through which she sells fresh fruit. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Phiona has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more fresh fruit to sell, and will help Phiona to generate greater profits and take care of her child and her family. Phiona hopes that in the future she will be able to increase her capital in her business. \r\n\r\nPhiona is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

This is 36-year-old Moasi from Masvingo. Moasi is a single parent with three children; two are attending school. Moasi runs a retail business which sells groceries. The business has been in operation for one year now.

This is 39-year-old Tracy from Mutare. Tracy is married with two children, both attending school. She also cares for three dependents. Tracy runs a retail business; she sells clothes, shoes and electrical gadgets. The business has been in operation for four years.

WSDS since 2010. They are a group of six women from a tribal community and live in a very small and remote village in the state of Manipur, in the Northeastern part of India.\r\n\r\nThe profile representative of \u201cNgailut\u201d Group is Nengneikim. She is the one on the extreme left of the picture with her right hand raised. She has two sons and one daughter and her husband is a daily wage earner whose income is not enough to meet the daily expenses of the family. Being a woman, she cannot do hard labor work so she weaves and, with the minimal sum of money she gets, she runs the house.  \r\n\r\nShe is an active member of the group and a very efficient, dedicated and hardworking woman. With the first loan from WSDS, she bought two piglets. After a year and half, they had grown to full size and were ready to be sold in the market. With the profit she earned, she could repay the loan on time and with the remaining, she was able to buy some other essential requirements for the family and some household items.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, she will buy four piglets and construct a bigger pigsty to set up a piggery farm in the future. She also said that she has a bigger dream of purchasing a mini van for public transportation, which she said will benefit the people in her village and the surrounding villages and at the same time she will also be able to benefit from it. In order to fulfill her dreams, she manages regular monthly savings from her profits in her new bank account.

They all work hard to gather a good harvest and earn a high income.\r\n\r\nThe car, by which they are taking the harvest to the market, is very old and needs to be repaired. Unfortunately, Hasmik has no financial means to repair that car and time after time it is becoming difficult for the family to take the harvest to the market. \r\n\r\nSo, Hasmik has requested a loan from SEF International to, first, repair the car and then expand the farm. With the loan's help, Hasmik will purchase potato and barley seeds and will pay fuel costs. Hasmik is sure that the loan will give them an opportunity to sustain their farm and earn a high enough income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1352822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

This is her eighth Kiva loan and, since she wants to continue expanding, she is committed to paying back the loan on time.\r\n\r\nNerva plans to use the 2,000 PEN loan to buy work utensils such as knives, forks, spoons, aprons, etc. "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1353887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy utensils such as knives, forks, spoons, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T07:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T07:30:04Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nerva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2032.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090562}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T15:52:29Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":560778,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more rice to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T07:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T07:30:04Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":362.7,"local_amount":701.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":721.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381678271},{"amount":24.8,"local_amount":48.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":49.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390542486},{"amount":78.53,"local_amount":151.99,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":156.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399791340},{"amount":308.97,"local_amount":598.01,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":614.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410549284}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T12:46:16Z","paid_date":"2013-10-19T08:44:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kim Bradford-Watts","image":472913}},{"id":560779,"name":"Sofia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sofia is 21-years-old and lives in the town of Nakifuma in the Mukono region of Uganda.

Together with her husband, Nashkhun is engaged in agriculture. She keeps 4 cows, 14 sheep, 2 pigs, 20 chickens and 10 colonies of bees and also cultivates wheat and barley. Nashkhun gets milk and other milk products and her husband sells the gathered agricultural products locally. The income from selling is very important for Nashkhun and her husband to be able to sustain the family's life. As farming business is the only source of their income, Nashkhun would like to expand it. Having no financial means to do so, Nashkhun has requested a loan from SEF International. With the loan's help, she will purchase five sheep, fertilizer and seeds for the land cultivation. This will give Nashkhun an opportunity to cultivate more fruits and vegetables and gather high income, which is vital for Nashkhun and her

She lives in Akhaltsikhe district with her husband Ivane, her 22-year-old son, her daughter in-law and her granddaughter who is 3 years old. Nazibrola has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected every time because of her family's low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from trading. Nazibrola rents a car to go to the capital city. She purchases household goods from a big market at a wholesale price and brings it to her village to sell among the villagers with a price markup.  The family also owns a plot of agricultural land where haricot, maize and potatoes are grown. The harvested products are generally used for individual use and sometimes for trading at the local markets to earn a  small income.\r\n\r\nNazibrola has requested a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Nazibrola has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit Nazibrola will purchase a car. She will not have to rent a car for her trading business anymore and it will significantly increase her income. She will also be able to purchase a bigger stock of household goods and offer better choice to her clients. As Nazibrola is already known in this field among the villagers her business will be more successful. With the increased income she will be able to provide better living conditions for her big family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1352858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a car for her trading business.

He lives in Terjola district with his wife Teona, his parents and retired grandfather. Mirian had requested for a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from their agricultural business. In particular, they have two milk cows and a vineyard. The cows are milked to make cheese. From the harvested grapes they make wine and vodka. All the products are sold locally at the markets. Mirian's grandfather's monthly pension is additional income for the family.\r\n\r\nMirian requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Mirian has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Mirian will purchase stocks of plumbing equipment and open a plumbing shop. He has already rented a space in the populous area which will promote his business development. In order to decrease the expenses and increase the profit Mirian will work in the shop himself as a seller. His efforts will make the business successful and profitable and Mirian will be able to improve the family's living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1352906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase stocks of plumbing equipment and open a plumbing shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Terjola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":102.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":107.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":111.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":111.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":114.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":121.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":123.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":124.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":130.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":136.74},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":138.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":142.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":145.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":148.16},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":152.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":157.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.39},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.89},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.94,"local_amount":89.94,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":89.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749729},{"amount":100.25,"local_amount":100.25,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613636},{"amount":2809.81,"local_amount":2809.81,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2809.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857349}],"funded_date":"2013-05-24T14:47:33Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T14:59:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kavita Shah","image":780734}},{"id":560835,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is 21 years old and lives in the town of Nakifuma in the Mukono region of Uganda.

She is single with four children, all of whom attend school. She is not looking after any additional family members.\r\n\r\nShe has been selling charcoal and banana leaves in the market for 10 years, working seven days a week. She does not have an additional source of income. \r\n\r\nZaina has requested a loan of UShs 200,000 from MCDT- SACCO to enable her to buy more bags of charcoal for sale. Her challenges include seasonality and transportation. Her dream is to open a second outlet. She joined MCDT because, unlike other financial institutions in her area of residence, she did not need collateral to access loans. She rents a house with access to both electricity and piped water.  Her major monthly expenses include rent and school fees. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1352930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more bags of charcoal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T14:20:06Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":48468.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372973535},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":64624.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381753693},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":80780.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390617676},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":64624.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399861515}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T14:27:45Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:18:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":560882,"name":"Sarah's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah's group is comprised of three hard-working women.

This is 33-year-old Pilate from Bulawayo. He is married with one child. He also cares for two dependents. Pilate runs a retail business selling clothes, shoes, ladies' wear and phones as well. The business has been in operation for four years.

As his salary is hardly enough for covering his family's basic needs, agriculture helps Vladislav to have a stable income. Realizing that profit from his agricultural business is very important for him, Vladislav would like to expand it. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan from SEF International in order to increase his farming business.

She sells that harvest locally and earns income which is vital for her to make ends meet. Lyudmila would like to expand her farm but she has no means to finance an expansion, so she has decided to apply for this loan.

Edilma has had a business for five years selling products that she promotes via specialized guides. She sells, for example, dresses, shoes, and perfume. In the beginning she also sold chicha [a maize drink] and other drinks made from fruit. This is how she built up a customer base, and she started selling varied merchandise in response to their needs. She has a small store in her own home and stocks it with products, often ones that her clients request. She offers special discounts through her sales catalogues. \r\nShe mainly sells on credit but also accepts cash. She works every day of the week from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm. Her main clients are located in her neighbourhood and the surrounding area. Edilma's business has grown bit by bit, first in clientele and then in infrastructure. Her most important assets are her display cases and cooler. She is applying for a loan on Kiva, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy clothing for men and women, children's shoes, and perfume. This will allow her to respond to pending orders. \r\nShe is working very hard to see her children become professionals, to succeed in life, and to have permanent jobs - a dream of

This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, an egg, and other things.

Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby, and the people in the community. She earns 300 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nBelinda hopes that her business will continue to grow and she is hoping to help her parents and give her children a good education and life. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, where she also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has two children who still live at home, and she lives with her long-term partner, who is the children's father. Reina\u2019s most important challenge is to live according to God\u2019s will.\r\n\r\nReina is requesting her tenth loan from Esperanza International. Because her loan repayments have all been made punctually, she has been able to grow her business with the re-investment from each loan. She has had the opportunity to improve her life and family and expand her business to get more clients. Reina would like to save her profits to renovate her house and give her children a safer home. In the future, she wants to become a successful and professional businesswoman.

","en":"Zoraida, age 51, lives in the municipality of Puerto Colombia, on the shores of the Caribbean Sea. The people there are very warm, healthy, and love to celebrate. Zoraida has a small variety store there where she sells items that the locals like, such as clothing, cologne, women's accessories, and home accessories.\r\nShe started her business five years ago, but she has 20 years' experience as a merchant; she decided 20 years ago to start generating her own income from home. She sells her products directly to the customers on credit and for cash. Experience has taught her to buy the products that are offered by the wholesalers in the city of Barranquilla, where she can get discounts for purchases of higher volumes. She is now applying for a loan on Kiva, her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy women's and children's clothing, perfume, creams, and various accessories. She will have success with this investment because she knows the market fluctuations very well, and she especially knows where to buy to satisfy her distinguished clientele. For the future, her goal is to set up her business outside of her home and to finish remodeling her home. Her greatest challenge is saving up enough money, and increasing her income enough to support her and her family's well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1353939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

is 32 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has two children who are both currently in school. For the past 12 years, Harriet has been working hard to manage her small business in which she sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Harriet has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes to sell, and will help Harriet to generate greater profits and pay for some of the school needs for her children. Harriet hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand her business and own another clothing business around the center. \r\n\r\nHarriet is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding down the highway in a speeding jeepney. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy greater quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. \r\n\r\nJenneth hopes to expand her business so she can help her workers. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1353404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

38. She is a single mother of three daughters. She lives in a wooden house with her small family. She sells edible products such as rice, milk, pasta, and vegetables from her stall located in the local market. Previously, she worked in the fields harvesting organic cocoa. However, she felt that she was not able to spend enough time with her daughters, so she decided to take over a stall that her cousin gave her.\r\nShe started off with just a few products because she did not have enough working capital. With time and hard work she was able to expand her business until it became her family's main economic support. Every day, she receives her customers. They are mainly housewives.

Now her son is rendering taxi service day and night, contributing to the family income. Her husband has retired from work and now stays at home. The house they live in loses its heat greatly during winter time and the family uses lots of coal for heating. So she is requesting a loan of 3,500,000 Tugriks (MNT) to purchase a low pressure furnace. Using this item, her family will reduce their coal consumption thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution by releasing fewer pollutants into the air.
