Annet is 22 and lives in the town of Luwero in Uganda. She is married and has 2 children who are currently in school. For the past 2 years, Annet has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Annet has requested a loan of 450,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes to sell and will help Annet to generate greater profits and pay school fees for his children. Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1355730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She has an adobe house where she lives with her six children thus forming a big family.  \r\n\r\nAntonia owns farmland outside the location where she lives where she grows organic cocoa beans.  She started in this business more than 20 years ago because agriculture was her only option for earning money to support her family.  Since she\u2019d grown up in the countryside she\u2019d learned what was necessary to grow quality fruit using organic manure and providing adequate care to her crops.  \r\n\r\nPart of the land she grows on was passed down to her by her parents and as time passed she\u2019s managed to enlarge it by buying neighboring parcels.  Having more land to cultivate means she needs more money too to buy cocoa bean plants and others which she was able to do using her savings.  She comments that it\u2019s always necessary to have money to cover other needs like weed removal and gathering the beans for which she must hire local laborers.  \r\n\r\nIn future, she\u2019d like to acquire a vehicle to transport her products from her farmland to her place of residence because private transportation providers charge very high prices for transportation services.  Another of her objectives is to make home improvements; she wants to build it with adobe.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third Kiva loan which is the reason why she\u2019s grateful for the opportunity she\u2019s being given to reach her work goals.  On this occasion, she\u2019d like to have 1,000 soles to buy organic manure for her plants.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1354022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T18:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T18:00:09Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":103.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":103.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":112.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":116.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.25,"local_amount":75.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":79.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975635},{"amount":36.53,"local_amount":91.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":95.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996903},{"amount":37.74,"local_amount":94.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":98.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864374},{"amount":36.49,"local_amount":91.24,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":95.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352741},{"amount":40.18,"local_amount":100.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":105.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904511},{"amount":41.5,"local_amount":103.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":108.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090568},{"amount":41.37,"local_amount":103.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":108.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777319},{"amount":44.23,"local_amount":110.57,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":115.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450597864},{"amount":44.91,"local_amount":112.28,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-14T09:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":117.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147254},{"amount":46.8,"local_amount":116.99,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-09T09:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":122.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240488}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T19:10:46Z","paid_date":"2014-09-09T09:56:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":561545,"name":"Maycol Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"MAYCOL tiene 18 a\u00f1os de edad es soltero no tiene cargas familiares, vive con la hermana en Guaranda provincia de Bol\u00edvar.\n\nMAYCOL se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz, papas, adem\u00e1s se dedica a la crianza de pollos, cerdos. \n\nSolicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar dos cerdos, polvillo.

He works every day for about 10 hours and thinks he does well because of the good way he does his work and because of the kind way he treats others.\r\n\r\nPier is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support provided he will be able to buy a door that he wants to install in his parents\u2019 bedroom because they currently just have a curtain and winter is approaching.  Pier would like to provide a little more security and well-being for his family while he will continue working and striving to reach his great dream: to be able to study a professional career.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1354052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a door.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ca\u00f1ete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-20T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-19T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pier Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":74.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":78.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":81.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":88.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":91.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.96,"local_amount":74.91,"processed_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":78.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664523},{"amount":31.45,"local_amount":78.62,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776078},{"amount":32.53,"local_amount":81.32,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779236},{"amount":106.06,"local_amount":265.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":278.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054420}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T21:37:30Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":561846,"name":"Santa Maria De 6 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las 15 integrantes de este comit\u00e9 son mujeres jefas de familia, que luchan por da a sus hijos todo lo que ellas no han podido tener, desean crecer y demostrar que trabajando se puede salir adelante.\nMaximina es artesana en barro y cuenta que tiene mucha habilidad, su clientela siempre compra de ella sus novedades ya que son muy lindas y finas.

They live together with their four children in a home made of adobe. For 14 years, Alejandra has worked in agriculture with her husband's support, on a plot of land which measures 4 hectares. Her parents taught her to cultivate profitable local products, such as organic cocoa and coffee, when she was a child. When she turned 20, her parents gave her a small plot of land so that she could work independently.\r\nWith the passing of time, she used her income to progressively expand her agricultural land in order to increase her income. However, once she had a lot of land she realized that she needed to hire labourers. They now help her with her work so that her product can be of good quality for sale in the markets. This will allow her to recuperate the money she invests in the crops.\r\nIn order to improve the quality of her products, she uses organic fertilizer because she thinks that chemical fertilizers are detrimental to the quality of the land.

His father used to work as an agronomist at a local kolkhoz (collective farm), and his mother also worked there as a farmer.  His parents used to work in the fields from morning until the evening, seven days a week.  As a child, Qahramon saw all that, and dreamed about working on a farm one day, like his father, because even though the family was poor and faced financial hardship, they were also happy. \r\n\r\nQahramon is now married and he has two children.  For the past four years he has been involved in raising cattle and smaller livestock.  In addition to this activity, he also works on a farm.  His wife helps him by producing and selling her own dairy products at home.\r\n\r\nWith a growing family and more needs to meet, Qahramon would like to increase his business.

She has fully repaid back her past loan with success, and it has enabled her to sustain her living at a good pace. \n\nFor this cycle, she formed a group of two to apply for a new loan. As the leader, she will use the loan for leasing a plot of farmland to expand the scale of her cash crop growing. She will also use a portion to plow her farmland and buy corn seeds for her cultivated land. She hopes that this purchase will help her to grow her corn on time and return her a good yield.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1350308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She completed secondary school even though her parents separated.\n\nShe took classes in secretarial studies, jewelry, and entrepreneurship.  Then, because she worked every day, she didn't have time to study.  She let a lot of time go by until she decided to change to a half-time job so she could return to her studies.\n\nIt's very important to her to bring herself up to date and learn, because technology is more advanced all the time.

She is purchasing clothes from the big market in the capital city of Georgia, Tbilisi, and selling them at the local market where she rents a counter. Even though she is selling the clothes herself, the profit is still very small as the expenses are high and it\u2019s very hard for her to cover her monthly expenses.\r\n\r\nDali requested loan from Credo to start a family business.

The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit Dali will purchase a car. She wants to start trading vegetables. In front of her house Dali has a small space to put the counter and trade vegetables. She will purchase the products from the big market in the capital city at the wholesale price and sell them with the price marked up to earn additional income. \r\n\r\nDali will use part of her profits for reinvesting and expanding her business, and the other part to cover her monthly expenses and have better living

She joined with the other group members to apply for a loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua because they have always been neighbors and friends.\r\n\r\nAmal is a 41-year-old widow who has been working in food production. She specializes in the mouneh business, which aims at a food preservation strategy, allowing foods from one season to be eaten another time during which they are not typically available. She started five years ago to provide her family with the necessary living needs since her husband passed away. She is taking the role of the loving mother and the hardworking father at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe loan for which she applied will help her to increase her production, through buying the present season's production to prepare the foods for the other seasons in which they are not available, and selling them at good prices. She is well known in her region with the good quality of products she sells, in addition to the special competitive prices she sets. She hopes to keep increasing her production and expanding her work to open a wide shop in the future.\r\n\r\nAmal is pictured on the far right.\r\n\r\nSamira is the second from the left.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Adolfo studies in his town's technical school, is single and has a business selling perfumes. He sells them in his school, to his classmates and teachers; He says that he began this business to help his mother pay for a portion of his studies. Since the school asks him for a lot of work and material, this would help his mother. \r\n\r\nHe says it is going well for him because his clients already put in orders with him and this motivates him to move forward. He goes and buys them in Mexico City in different stores where they give him lower prices so that he is able to make some profit. He says that some of them are sent to him by his relatives in the United States because they are sold at slightly lower prices there, and that gives him another advantage. He sells his perfumes in cash or in payments so that it's not too hard for his clients and that way his perfumes don't lose their appeal.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan in order to stock up on men's and women's perfumes since he has various pending orders, and with what he makes from his sales he will be able to help with school expenses.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are named Silvia, Leshlye, Estela, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Nora Ang\u00e9lica, Reyna and Josefina.

He is very well-known in his community, which is located in the hills far from the city. For years, he worked alongside his father on the farm and in the blacksmith shop (making curved knives, machetes, and bars, among others). He started making these tools, which farmers use to work the land, at the age of 14. At the beginning, they worked along with three other people; now there are two. He also works in agriculture, farming 10,500 square meters of corn. At the age of 19, Fausto emigrated to the United States to work in construction. He returned to his country at the age of 23. Later, he once again moved abroad and returned when he was 27. By then, he had already bought a plot of land and built his house.\r\n\r\nHe wakes up at 3:00 a.m. to make sixteen curved knives before 9:00 a.m. Afterwards, he moves to the farm where he plants his crops in order to prepare the land. He buys iron and coal, the raw materials with which he makes knives and machetes, every 22 days in town, depending on the demand. He pays for transport to make these purchases. The process is the same when he buys farm supplies.\r\n\r\nHe is applying for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy fertilizer and to pay for workers to clear the land where he will cultivate 10,500 meters of corn. He will use the rest to buy iron and coal to make curved knives and machetes, because they are currently in great demand. With this investment, he will be able to obtain a good harvest which will help him to feed his family. By making more curved knives and machetes, he will receive greater earnings. He sells them in his house, and he sometimes goes out to make sales in the town plaza. He would like to improve his home and give his children an education, because he only studied up until the fifth

His loan requests were rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nKhatuna is a dance teacher. She owns a small dance studio and earns a small monthly income which is the only source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nAleksandre requested a loan from Kiva partner Credo in order to start-up a family business. Aleksandre has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high risk borrowers because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan Aleksandre will purchase a car to drive as a taxi. He will serve the locals by providing transport and will earn a small daily income for the family. Aleksandre is a very hard working man and he will work long hours to earn a good profit.

Ramin has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Ramin will install the water system in his greenhouse and purchase vegetable seeds and fertilizer. He has already built a greenhouse and now needs to prepare land for harvesting vegetables. The harvested products will be sold at the local markets, and Ramin will earn a good profit for his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1353567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To install the water system and purchase vegetable seeds and fertilizer for his greenhouse.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Batumi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-21T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-20T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":152.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":163.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":174.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":176.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":182.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":185.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":189.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":199.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":199.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":205.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":209.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":216.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":220.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":226.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":232.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":236.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.6},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.81,"local_amount":152.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":153.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749734},{"amount":99.57,"local_amount":162.1,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:56Z","rounded_local_amount":163.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613641},{"amount":100.42,"local_amount":163.47,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":164.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857354},{"amount":102.94,"local_amount":167.57,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":168.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134004},{"amount":106.94,"local_amount":174.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":175.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107593},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":176.16,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":177.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255137},{"amount":1538.1,"local_amount":2503.89,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2522.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019277}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T20:05:54Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":561264,"name":"Ashot","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ashot lives in the village of Artsvanik; it is located in the region of Syunik.

They have a piece of private land where they cultivate grapes, different vegetables and fruits. They also have some cattle. Ashot and his family are very happy since they have a good income from farming with permanent customers in Kapan who purchase their agricultural products. Ashot needs to buy three young cows and fodder for his animals, so he decided to take a loan from Nor Horizon and Kiva. The amount they need is 1.100.000 Armenia drams. This way, Ashot can enlarge his cattle breeding and receive a good profit from this deal.

She completed only the first three years of primary school but is grateful to her parents for supporting her through them.  Bacilia has five children with her husband.  The two oldest are in school, one is in nursery and the other two are too young for any school yet.  Over three years ago, Bacilia''s husband taught her how to grow coffee as it is a source of income for the family.  They sell their product to agents who came to the area and the couple describe their product as being of good quality and clean.  The couple grow the coffee on their own land as it was left to them by Bacilia's husband's parents.

is a 35-year-old married man with three children; he also looks after two orphans. He is teacher by profession and it is from teaching that he earns a living. In 2010, Godfrey realized that there was a need for a nursery school in his village. He took it upon himself to start up a nursery school so as to help poor parents have their children attend school at a low cost near their homes. Young pupils were traveling long distances in search for schools and his initiative has helped many in the village.\r\n\r\nGodfrey now wants a loan of 1,200,000 Ugandan Shillings to buy construction materials; especially, cement and sand to plaster the building so as to improve the environment his pupils are studying in. His dream is to develop the school and have classes up to primary seven, providing quality primary education at a low cost for the children in his village. He faces various challenges including late payment and at times non-payment of school fees by parents, which makes the operations very difficult.

In 2007, Kitiya founded Mischobeauty.com, a beauty-centric website, with followers all over the world who read Kitiya\u2019s beauty product reviews and learn more about the world of beauty.  \r\n\r\nKitiya has an academic background in chemistry. Her goal is to combine her passions for chemistry and beauty by launching her first nail polish product line. Kitiya sees the nail polish line as the first of many opportunities for her business.\r\n \r\nKitiya first started working on developing her nail polish line five or six years ago. After the birth of her son, Kitiya began reading the labels on her nail polish and noticed the number of harsh chemicals in the bottle. Kitiya will develop a 5-FREE formula, meaning the nail polish will not have any of the five common toxins. \r\n\r\nKitiya is currently working with one of the largest laboratories and manufacturers of quality nail polish.

He started teaching math at a local middle school and discovered his calling. Eventually he opened a tutoring business that rapidly grew by word of mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI enjoy teaching,\u201d Chattar said. \u201cAnd the students I had learned a lot with my background and my patience and my teaching style.\u201d\r\n\r\nChattar started teaching at a high school and saw that there was a strong need for one-on-one tutoring in math. So he started tutoring his high school students. Eventually, he used his business training background to start a tutoring business. Originally he called the business MathMobile, because math was his specialty. \r\n\r\n\u201cBut thereafter it just grew,\u201d Chattar said. \u201cThe parents we had started referring us to other clientele and we just grew. And now we have 25 tutors and we just run the business and make sure we hire the right type of people to work as tutors.\u201d\r\n\r\nChattar changed the name of the business to Texas Mobile Tutorials to better reflect the broad range of subjects the company tutors: math, English\/reading, social studies, biology, chemistry, physics, history, test preparation, computer programs, and other topics.\r\n\r\nRecently, Texas Mobile Tutorials became an approved provider under the Texas Education Agency\u2019s Supplemental Educational Services program, enabling Chattar\u2019s company to serve low-income students in schools at risk of failing to meet state education standards. \r\n\r\nThe contract might seem like a boon for Chattar\u2019s tutorial business. But Chattar said he has to pay his tutors and buy the books and other material up front. He is guaranteed payment by the state, but weeks after services have already been delivered. \r\n\r\nSo Chattar applied for a working capital loan with Accion Texas Inc. after learning about the nonprofit organization through the Small Business Administration in El Paso. Using his $5,450 loan to buy materials and to pay tutors immediately after rendering services, Chattar said he was able to pick up 10 students from the state program. \r\n\r\nChattar said he hopes to serve more students through the program as he builds his capital, pays off his loan, and eventually obtains revolving credit for his business.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe would have had to let go of those students if we didn\u2019t get the Accion Texas loan,\u201d Chattar said.

She has one child and has been doing this work (agriculture) for eight years.

An animal on the farm has been given the name of 'Cheptil.'\r\n\r\nMagdaline was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Joined Juhudi Kilimo after seeing members from another group benefit from Juhudi Kilimo.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Was taught how to manage funds in agriculture like record keeping.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit her family', Magdaline replied 'Will generate more income through value addition of agricultural product.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Magdaline owns the following: 'cow, poultry, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

He lives with his wife, Estela, in a rented home and has for a year and a half.  \"The ease of irrigation makes our crops of good quality and our nearness to the central road keeps the prices low,\" he says.  Like a good farmer, he analyzes his reason for success.  When he was very young he learned to work with his land that he inherited from his parents.  Now that he decided to form a family of his own, he hopes to improve his income so he can acquire all he needs.  His main crops are potatoes, barley, and peas.  Thanks to his constant work he has already bought a good cow.  With this he also hopes to begin raising livestock.  Because he is a responsible man, he doesn't have any children yet, but his goal is to buy a good house so he can provide them with an education.  This will be his second Kiva loan and he is very grateful with the financial support and he is committed to being on time with his payments.  Miller will use the 1,000 PEN to buy compost to feed his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1354728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-21T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-20T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miller","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450597872}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T17:03:02Z","paid_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She is able to attract customers to her merchandise.  She has ten years of experience in the retail field and was able to learn all of the nuances of buying and selling merchandise during this time.  Her merchandise consists of shoes - a lot of shoes and galoshes.  According to Nargiza's own words, now is the season for selling summer slippers and she has to update her merchandise often and quickly.  And truly, when coming to her store, one could not look at her merchandise in detail because there were a lot of customers (but it is necessary to point out that not all who looked were buying shoes).  According to Nargiza's words, the secret to such a number of clients and sales is in the prices of her goods.  She brings in shoes and galoshes herself and this is why sells them slightly cheaper than others.  Nargiza does not have a higher education, but handles business affairs perfectly.  She has three loving children.  Her husband helps her with the sales business.  The children attend a school and a university.  Due to the season, Nargiza needs additional money.  She does not want to miss out on the \"golden\" time and brings in merchandise while there is high demand for it, but does not have available funds.  She came to MDO \"Arvand\" for a loan with this goal in mind.  She is grateful in advance for the help and assistance in advancing her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1343015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy seasonal merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-21T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-20T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nargiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":103.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":108.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":110.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":113.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":116.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":119.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":126.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.32,"local_amount":96.32,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":96.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752026},{"amount":98.62,"local_amount":98.62,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":98.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616113},{"amount":100.98,"local_amount":100.98,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859983},{"amount":103.39,"local_amount":103.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:38Z","rounded_local_amount":103.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136727},{"amount":105.86,"local_amount":105.86,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":105.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900922},{"amount":108.39,"local_amount":108.39,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":108.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550106},{"amount":110.98,"local_amount":110.98,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":110.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774331},{"amount":475.46,"local_amount":475.46,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":475.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673463}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T23:43:07Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":561690,"name":"Sevinc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sevinc is 27 years old and the mother of two children.

The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. \r\n\r\nMrs Altanchimeg has been working as a senior chef at a restaurant for five years. Her husband has been teaching driving skills to local people since 2010. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has been deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. So Mrs Altanchimeg is requesting a loan of 2,300,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, fibreglass and foam. Using these materials, she and her husband will repair and make insulation to their house thus making their home more comfortable and a warmer place. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and then contribute to the efforts against air pollution. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is a very hard-working individual who
