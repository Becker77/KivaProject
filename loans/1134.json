Teona  has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start a family business but her loan requests have always been rejected because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTeona is requesting a loan from Credo to start up a family business. She will open a business selling clothing and household goods. Teona will go to Turkey to purchase items at wholesale prices and bring them back to her home district to sell at a mark-up to villagers.  Her loan has been approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to loan credits. These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. Teona's loan will help her to earn additional income for her family and improve their living conditions.

She was born and raised, being surrounded by this type of activity. \r\n\r\nShe told us that since she was a young girl she proved herself to be a persistent woman and dreamed of having her own brick factory. When she started her family, she opened a small factory which today is now one of the biggest factories in the area. She said that she makes a few thousand bricks a month and sells them in in various cities close to her home. Now she wants to improve the quality of the bricks, which would help her to increase sales in private institutions. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan she has taken out through KIVA.

To provide the primary source of income for her family, Almagul is involved in animal husbandry, having started this business nine years ago with a purchase of livestock for 60,000 som.  Thanks to Almagul's persistent work, today her business contains three cattle with offspring, five small livestock, and 1.20 hectares of leased land, where she grows barley and wheat.  In order to further develop her business, Almagul requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy cattle and pesticides for treating the land.  She plans to use the earnings from the loan to invest into a further increase of domestic livestock and dreams of growing her business by opening a small food market in the

He is a married man who takes care of the food expenses, the rent and the bills for his family thanks to the income generated by his hardware business, a business in which he has 10 years experience already. He is a member of one of the UIMCEC branches and has already received 3 previous loans. It is thanks to these loans from his UIMCEC branch that he was able to open his own hardware store.

After leaving the Marines, Jon pursued a college degree and in 2004 moved to San Diego to begin working in the field of computer management.  \r\n\r\nFrustrated with the lack of integrity and low commitment to helpful customer service commonly found in the industry, Jon looked for a way to provide better personal computer and information service to his clients.

He was eventually offered an opportunity to take over a technology consulting firm, and he became the owner of All Connected Consulting.\r\n\r\nOver 10 years later, Jon continues to offer the highest customer service and innovative solutions to the clients who entrust him with their data.

transportation companies. But his world and his finances collapsed when all in the same year, he and his first wife divorced and then he suffered a heart attack. Splitting the assets from his business with his ex-wife, coupled with an avalanche of medical bills after the heart attack, caused Joseph to become homeless for a brief period of time. \r\n\r\n\u201cI was living in this van and I could smell a hamburger that was grilling several blocks away,\u201d Joseph said, describing this time in his life. \u201cThat\u2019s how hungry I was.\u201d  \r\n\r\nJoseph picked up the pieces of his life by getting a job with a trucking company, and then going back to school to get his certification in accounting. Last year, he started a new life: he remarried and became a stepfather.  He also started a new business:  The Accounting Firm of Meizer & Meizer. \r\n\r\nJoseph does payroll and accounting services, specializing in transportation and warehousing companies. Joseph wanted to expand his services and to hire a part-time clerical worker so he could focus on sales. He applied for a small working capital loan with Accion Texas Inc. after a friend and client told him about the nonprofit organization.  Joseph is using his loan to buy a computer and software, to secure a lease for a small office space, and to hire a clerical worker. \r\n\r\n\u201cStarting a small business is like having a child,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cI am at the toddler stage. A toddler is learning to walk, and gaining confidence, but he needs something to hold on to while he\u2019s getting on his feet.  Well, this loan is something to hold onto. And now my legs can get stronger and then I can move on from here.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs business picks up, and Joseph builds his capital, he plans to expand his business, hire more workers, and then eventually go back into the trucking and transportation industry again. He knows he can do it because he ran successful companies in the past. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through the ringer, but I never lost faith,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cI really appreciate where I am in my life right now.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1354582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She's a professional woman who has turned her career into a way of life, since she considers people's lives and health to be fundamental in order to get ahead. She basically tends to pregnant women in a place she has established for that purpose. Her services are destined to expectant mothers, however she can tend to anyone who needs help by providing them with the necessary guidance so that they can be treated by an expert physician. She has been in this line of work for over two years and she has been gradually improving her services thanks to the supplies and lab equipment she has acquired little by little. What she enjoys about her business is that it allows her to have time to care for her family whenever she needs to.

She handles the expenses of the family herself, since her ex-husband does not help to support the children. She lives in the family home (of her parents). \r\n\r\nFor over five years, she has been buying and selling food products in a store, which is located near an oil production factory. She copes with the business herself and has regular customers. Sitora dreams of buying herself and her children all the necessities for a happy life. She has to buy food to expand the assortment of products, but she has no money. If she does not expand her product assortment, she will lose her customers, as other business owners periodically expand their range of goods. \r\n\r\nShe is the main breadwinner in the family and therefore worries that she may lose her customers and be left without money. She is asking for a loan of 7,000 somoni to buy food products such as assorted pastries, candy, tea, pasta, oil, salt, etc."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1351854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy food items such as biscuits, candy, tea, pasta, butter, etc. for her food market ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-05-22T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-21T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":463.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":517.23},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":513.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":518.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":565.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":568.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":587.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":611.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":623.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":655.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":677.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":697.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97.84,"local_amount":464.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":465.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693530},{"amount":109.08,"local_amount":517.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":518.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556357},{"amount":565.43,"local_amount":2683.4,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2689.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550191},{"amount":128.5,"local_amount":609.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":611.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410959165},{"amount":131.51,"local_amount":624.12,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":625.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075324},{"amount":136.68,"local_amount":648.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":650.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228002},{"amount":305.96,"local_amount":1452,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1455.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439988985}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T04:20:51Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:12:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":561747,"name":"Ngoc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngoc is 49 years old and is married with three children.

She scoops the cooked fruit into a big mortar and gently pounds with a pestle to avoid damaging the nut. Water is then added to the pounded fruit. The mixture of water and the pounded fruit is squeezed and filtered to get the juice out and the chaff removed. The chaff is sometimes used by the local people to light charcoal fires. The juice is boiled again and as it boils, the fresh oil will float to the surface of the pot. The oil is scooped into yet another pot and left to cool. \r\n\r\nFresh oil from palm fruits is traditionally used in eating roasted yam or plantains in Africa \u2013 especially on the farms after a hard day's work. Palm oil is the preferred type of cooking oil because Ghanaians like its consistency and flavor. It is used in most traditional dishes.\r\n\r\nShe is responsible for all the general upkeep of herself and children. Her loan will be used to buy bags of beans, maize and palm-nut fruits.

He is 41 years old, married, and he has a family.  He has been working in carpentry for more than 10 years.  He does not own a lot of equipment to work on construction sites.  He therefore has to rent equipment, which is very costly.

She is married with 3 children between the ages of 3 months and 14 years. Two of her children are currently attending school. In 1998, Fatmata established her palm oil business. She began her business because she wanted to create income to support her family. She works at the business 9 hours per day, 6 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are high competition in the market and sometimes sales are very slow.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase beans and palm oil for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and grow her business. In the future, Fatmata plans to change her business to a cosmetics shop. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1354367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is very motivated to provide her children a beautiful life with a good education, food and clothing. She has improved her business to meet day-to-day expenses of life. Currently, she needs to purchase another buffalo to increase the production milk. For this reason, she applied for a loan of Rs. 30,000 to Kashf Foundation.

is 45 years old. He lives in Ochkhamuri village, Kobuleti district with his 42-year-old wife, four children and retired mother. Israil requested loan from the local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nIsrail has a car. He drives it as a taxi to transport local people and earns small daily income, which is the main source of living for the family. Their additional income is Israil\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly pension. He is very hard working man and works long hours to earn good income, but it\u2019s still not enough to feed his seven-member family.\r\n\r\nHe requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Israil has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re- start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Israil will install gas equipment in his car. The gas is cheaper then fuel and with installing the gas system in the car he will decrease his expenses and increase the profit. Increased profit will help him provide all the needed living conditions for his family. Israil hopes for your support.

Hawa, she is in her late twenties and is from Moriba town Bo, in Sierra Leone. She is married with two children between the ages of four and 11 years. One of her children is currently attending school. In 2007, Hawa established her leather slipper business. She began her business because she did not go to school and her father was a shoemaker, so she was trained in business. She works in the business every day and moves around her community to introduce her goods. She says that the main challenges to her business are insufficient capital to expand her business and the sometimes slow purchasing power of customers.\r\n\r\nHawa requires a loan in order to purchase more leather slippers to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and renovate her house. In the future, Hawa plans to expand her business and build a permanent business structure. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1354428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is 43 years old and lives in the West Point area, which has the most populated market in Montserrado County. She is married, and her husband is a businessman. They both have four children aged between 13 and 23; only two are in school and live at home. She was unable to go to school, but she is business-minded. For the past twelve years, she has been selling dry fish from a table in the local market. She likes her business because of the ways customers buy from her. She started this business with money given to her by husband. She walks every day to buy her goods since her table is much closer to the local wholesale area. She is requesting a loan to purchase more dry fish for her business. She plans to buy a piece of land and build a house.

Ica, district of Parcona.  He is a very kind, hard-working, enthusiastic person who has a great desire to get ahead.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of resources and the need to work to help his parents, Yerson was unable to get a professional mechanic's degree as he would have liked.  In his free time he enjoys watching films and sometimes he cooks delicious pork cracklings to share with his family.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Yerson works selling construction materials at a hardware store in his city.  He works an average ten hours a day and believes work is going well for him because he is kind to people.\r\n\r\nYerson is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks their help he will be able to buy a kitchen stove.  The one they use at home now runs on kerosene, is in disrepair and dangerous to use.  So this means Yerson will be able to provide more safety and well-being for his family.

He is married and has two children 14 and 18 years old. He has no additional dependents living with him.\r\nIn 1997, Jusu established his tailoring business. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 700,000 (Sierra Leone leones) every month from this business.\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000 in order to buy more tailoring materials. Jusu has been unable to buy a piece of land where he intends to build a house.

She has been running this business for 15 years. Mamie works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to operate her business.\r\n\r\nMamie has requested a loan in order to purchase food items such as dry fish, onions, beans and pepper.

She would like to invest in the purchase of larger quantities of stone, silver, wood and bone beads. Since these beads come from Cameroon, Abidjan, and Mali, she can get a better price by purchasing larger amounts.\r\n\r\nTina has been selling through NOVICA since 2001. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I am a descendant of the Ga Mashie royal family, and when I was just three weeks old my father died. I wanted to be a teacher, but to cope with difficult financial times I taught reading classes while I trained in auto spraying. I also worked at a textiles company during the week and at the weekends I made beaded jewelry for personal customers and to sell at street markets. I've always been interested in working with underprivileged children, as I too suffered many hardships as a child. I started a program called 'Children In Need' in 1996, and I started teaching them our traditional bead making crafts.

She plans to stock up on fabric and other materials to increase production.\r\n\r\nWahyu has been selling through NOVICA since 2012. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I work in Java's legendary batik art. I'm always keen to learn new things and new techniques. My family taught me that I must work hard to succeed in life. Now I am married and we have a lovely daughter. In my small batik workshop, I specialize in handbags, cushion covers and table runners, and add details with beads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for your support by funding this micro-credit.

Aminata was a housewife; she decided to start a business because she wants to contribute in the home.\r\n\r\nAminata runs a palm oil business; she sells gallons of palm oil. She has been running this business for 9 years. She works at the business from one village to another to buy the palm oil, and there is a particular place where they meet to sell. She describes her major problems as transportation costs and sometimes vehicle breakdown on the way.  \r\n\r\nAminata has requested a loan in order to buy more gallons of palm oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. In the future Aminata plans to establish her business more. She thanks you for your

of their daughter, where young people with disabilities could learn to create handicrafts. They would like to purchase materials such as paper, glue and beads to continue their work.\r\n\r\nArgentina and Francisco have been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is their story:\r\n\r\n\"Our daughter Nyla Eliza was born with hydrocephaly. She underwent several operations and as a result contracted meningitis, which left huge side effects and multiple disabilities. She passed away when she was 10 years old. In 1998 we founded Asociacion ADISA in her honor. What first began as a support group for parents and children with special needs has now become an association that provides education so that children can join mainstream schools. Youngsters adore making recycled paper crafts so they may eventually have a craft when they are too old to attend ADISA.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to this micro-credit, we will be able to continue giving job training and work to disabled young people. Your generosity will help our project to continue growing and we are very grateful for your assistance.

She began her business because she wanted to create an income to support the home. She works at the business every day, and she walks 4 miles away to her operation area. She says at present she faces a transportation problem in reaching her operation area.   \r\n\r\nKula requires a loan in order to buy more gallons of palm oil, and alongside this, beans and pepper.

She accepted, and that was how her business started. Today she sells clothes, footwear, bags and other items for women. She has not stopped working since 2009, when she began. Her day starts at 8 in the morning and continues until 7 at night, Monday to Sunday.\r\n\r\nHer customer base has exceeded expectations, but also it has exceeded her capacity to meet orders.

Isatu used the proceeds from her last loan to help her husband complete the dwelling house for their family. Parts of the proceeds were used to pay fees for her children and provide a better quality of life for her family. Isatu plans to continue to support her husband to educate their children to the university level.

She is married and has three children, who are 16, 7 and 5 years old respectively.\r\nIn 2007, Mary established her drinks business. She began her business because she wanted to assist her husband in taking care of the children. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 900,000 every month from this business.\r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Mary now requires this loan in order to buy different types of drinks to meet the needs of her customers. Mary has not opened any new business outlets because she was not able to secure a place to do so.

She makes her sales with cash and credit, studying her customers well. She acquires the sweet and the ingredients to prepare the lunches in the center of the city of Barranquilla with cash. Meanwhile, the merchandise that she offers from catalogs she acquires with credit. Her goal for the future is to build a bigger sized shop where only her business operates. But her great challenge is to have enough cash to fund the expansion of her business, respond to her customers and to always have her shop well stocked. Nidian is applying for her second credit with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With her previous loan, she was able to buy catalog cosmetic products, sweets, and ingredients in large volumes to produce more food. Also, she acquired three glass cases and four tables with which she could exhibit her merchandise better to impact the customers' desire to buy. Her success in this investment lies in her experience and also her purchase is a response to her customers' requests and to the current rotation of her products. Today, she has approached the Foundation to request a CrediKiva with which she will buy a refrigerator and a photocopier.

He worked for more than thirty years as a bookkeeper, and is now retired. After so many years of working, he cannot stand staying at home with nothing to do.\r\n\r\nSome friends suggested that Temurlali go to MLO Humo and Partners for a loan with a low interest rate to open his own business. So he went to Humo with the goal of obtaining a loan to buy a car so he could work as a taxi driver. He drove a car as part of his previous job, so he already has a driver's license. He has some savings which he would like to spend along with the loan to buy a car.
