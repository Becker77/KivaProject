They live comfortably together in their own home.\r\n\r\nWaldemar's business is providing a passenger transport service with a motorcycle taxi.  He started out in this line of work 12 years ago when he bought his first vehicle.  Over time, he has replaced his vehicle.  He enjoys his business because it allows him to make income with which to cover his family's expenses.  He started out in this business because he needed to make income as he wasn't able to get a decent job.  He now feels more secure as he is able to set his own work hours and be his own boss.  On the other hand, he says he doesn't like it when his motorcycle taxi breaks down or continually needs repairs because it costs him a lot of money.  If he does not deal with these issues on time, he is not able to work peacefully.  However, in spite of this, he is doing well and has plans to grow his transport business by purchasing a heavy goods vehicle as he will be able to make a lot more money with that type of vehicle.  \r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Waldemar is requesting a loan for 1,500 soles.  He is grateful to all the people who will give him the support he needs to accomplish his goals.  Waldemar will use the sum he has requested to have his motorcycle taxi serviced, buying some spare parts and accessories that he needs in order to continue working."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1356092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts for his motorcycle taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-22T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-21T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Waldemar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":221.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":239.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":239.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":257.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":267.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":274.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.92,"local_amount":221.53,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":223.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975653},{"amount":91.99,"local_amount":239.98,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":242.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996921},{"amount":91.64,"local_amount":239.06,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":241.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864391},{"amount":98.84,"local_amount":257.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":260.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352759},{"amount":102.52,"local_amount":267.45,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":269.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904529},{"amount":105.09,"local_amount":274.14,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":276.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090589}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T16:59:50Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":562577,"name":"D\u00fao Calvario Comalapense Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao Calvario Comalapense, este grupo esta formado por la se\u00f1ora Maria elena, de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, ella se dedica a la venta de productos comestibles de consumo diario, se dedica a esta actividad desde hace 13 a\u00f1os poco a poco a ido creciendo su negocio, esta solicitando este credito para la compra de mas mercaderia en productos comestibles para la venta ya que le hace falta capital para surtir un poco mas su negocio espera que le puedan ayudar con el credito solicitado.","en":"This group, D\u00fao Calvario Comalapense, was formed by Maria Elena.

Her husband renders transportation service between Ulaanbaatar and other cities. The house they live in is vulnerable to heat loss and to strong storms, due to a deteriorated and weak curb roof. So she is applying for a loan of 2,400,000 MNT to buy planks, fiberglass and cement. Using these materials, her husband can repair the curb roof of the house, thus stopping the loss of heat through the roof. Stopping heat loss will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and thus contribute to the efforts to combat air pollution.

His wife has retired and receives a state pension. His son works as a general engineer at another building company. His work time is short, so he decided to grow vegetables as a food source and for sale. So he is applying for a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to buy necessary items, such as a shovel, pipe for watering, and seeds. Those materials are needed urgently, because the appropriate season for growing vegetables is here, and any delay will result in a poor harvest. Growing vegetables will contribute to the efforts against air pollution, because vegetables convert carbon dioxide into oxygen though a process called photosynthesis.

She lives with her husband and their two children who are 8 and 14 years old.  Catherine's business is a kind of family tradition as her mother is in the same line of work.  It was from her mother that she learned her skills, watching her since she was a little girl.  Now mother and daughter support each other as they both sew school uniforms and sports kits.  In addition, they also sell products through specialized company catalogs which makes them extra income.  Their daily tasks begin at 7.00am and they work, without stopping, until 6.00pm.  They buy raw materials and supplies, design, cut, repair, sew, finish off the garments, then sell them.  They make their purchases with cash and their sales are on credit though some are for cash.  \r\n\r\nCatherine is currently applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy raw materials and supplies such as fabric, threads and accessories because she has an order for some sheets that she needs to fill.  Her goal for the future is to buy an embroidery machine and to own her own home.  Her biggest challenge is ensuring that her children become successful professionals and have a promising future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1356122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials and supplies such as fabric, threads and accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-05-22T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-21T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64581},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78338},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80166},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82036},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83950},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85909},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87914},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89965},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92064},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94213},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96411},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":114453}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.37,"local_amount":64581,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":65055.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968281},{"amount":42.9,"local_amount":78338,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":78913.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817463},{"amount":43.9,"local_amount":80166,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":80754.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323738},{"amount":90.89,"local_amount":165986,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":167204.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062327},{"amount":47.05,"local_amount":85909,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":86539.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732019},{"amount":47.93,"local_amount":87914,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":88559.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.21,"payment_id":450415247},{"amount":48.75,"local_amount":89965,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":90625.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":459104397},{"amount":50.41,"local_amount":92213,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-23T08:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":92889.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919315},{"amount":51.95,"local_amount":94868,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":95564.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140118},{"amount":115.12,"local_amount":210060,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":211602.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490834019}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T17:07:53Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:10:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":562564,"name":"Katherine","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Katherine, de 23 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer alegre, luchadora y emprendedora.

In this special loan Reynaldo is representing his church from the community of El Capotillo from the North of Santo Domingo. They (the church, called Esmirna Pentecostal Church) started a water project two years ago, in order to provide purified water to their community inhabitants, giving the service at a low price but with a high quality and the proper standard.\r\n\r\nWith this loan they will invest in a machine to make ice and will improve their distribution point (where they sterilize gallons, fill bottles with purified water and deliver them to the neighbors that go directly to the business to buy them or sellers that distribute them). By \"improve,\" they mean to buy 5-gallon water bottles and labels, change system pieces, paint walls and other investments.\r\n\r\nReynaldo is the pastor in this church and also is in change of the water project called Agua Esmirna (Water Esmirna) in honor of their church name. In their neighborhood live around 6 thousand people, and their plan is to distribute purified water to 50% of the inhabitants, at a cost of $0.50 US for a 5-gallon bottle water. With this, Reynaldo said, they want to impact different areas: economic, health, spiritual and many others. This community is an extremely poor area in Santo Domingo with many salubrity problems, potable water scarcity, diseases, pollution, etc. and with programs like this, the community could start changing their lives. This church is committed to start as many projects as they can to contribute to the development of this community. \r\n\r\nReynaldo thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity.

He lives with his wife, two of his children, and three grandchildren. He has 13 years of experience in the commercialization of livestock and 38 years working in agriculture. He prefers to work with livestock because he likes it more and he makes more money. He buys his supplies once a month because the ticket is expensive.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy two oxen to work. The oxen will help him to move the corn and bean harvests from the land to his house. His wish is to be a good stockbreeder to process milk and sell milk products. He needs pesticides, herbicides, seeds, manure, and to clean and plow the land to grow corn and beans. In this way he will have the money to buy all of the supplies that he needs in the appropriate moment to cultivate and obtain a very good production. His wish is to own more land to cultivate more since that production will serve him as food for his family and also for sale. From this sale he receives an income to improve the living conditions of his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1356160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two oxen to work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-05-22T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-21T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelino De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":539.36,"local_amount":539.36,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":539.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490816913},{"amount":327.02,"local_amount":327.02,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":327.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243650},{"amount":133.62,"local_amount":133.62,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":133.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517527008}],"funded_date":"2013-05-23T01:28:23Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":562288,"name":"Remelyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remelyne is 29 years old and engaged in the selling of motor parts and accessories, the area where she is gaining her daily net income.

actual socia, le propuso que confeccionaran y vendieran ropa masculina y especialmente camisas bordadas. La idea fue todo un \u00e9xito,  as\u00ed que hoy se dedican  a la elaboraci\u00f3n  de estas hermosas prendas especialmente de guayaberas, camisa masculina delicadamente bordada, que es suelta y de tela ligera y se lleva por fuera de los pantalones.\nSus principales clientes son amigos y vecinos y tambi\u00e9n compradores, a los que ha accedido a trav\u00e9s de las redes de internet, a quienes les vende de contado. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, doceavo cr\u00e9dito que ha recibido de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 telas para camisas, y para pagar mano de obra, debido  a que contrata los servicios de maquila con talleres externos. Su meta m\u00e1s adelante es abrir un local al p\u00fablico y aumentar sus utilidades, con el prop\u00f3sito de invertir en la educaci\u00f3n de sus 3 hijos, gener\u00e1ndole posibilidades de acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad, sue\u00f1o de prosperidad que Dennys no abandona.\n\n","en":"Ten years ago, Dennys undertook a business venture in her own sewing workshop, which she opened in June 2003, when her friend, fashion designer and  current business partner suggested they start making and selling men's clothing, especially embroidered shirts.  The idea was a great success and they still make these beautiful items today, especially 'guayabera' shirts (a delicately embroidered, loose-fitting men's shirt made from lightweight material which is not worn tucked in).  Her main customers are friends and neighbors but she also has buyers who she has reached through the Internet and who she sells to for cash.  \r\n\r\nDennys is currently applying for a Kiva loan (her 12th loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy fabric for making her shirts.  She will also pay workers as she contracts out some of the assembly work to external workshops.  Her goal for the future is to open a store and to increase her profits with the aim of investing in her three kids' education.  This will make it possible for them to receive a top-quality education.  Dennys will not give up this dream of prosperity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1356182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

As Indonesia has over 900 inhabited islands it can take very long to ship goods from the main island, where Nazava filters are made, to islands in eastern Indonesia.

This will help Rachel to save around 5 USD per water filter.\n\n\u201cIt is very hard to get clean drinking water in East Indonesia.

Besides, burning on wood emits greenhouse gases and the indoor fires cause many respiratory diseases.

She makes a good income because there are very few vendors for toy shops. Kids like to purchase new toys and play with them thus it is essential for her to refill her shop with more interesting toys to attract kids. Her sales increase during the summer and winter breaks because kids are on vacation. Therefore, she keeps track of the school breaks and makes sure she has what the kids want in her toy shop.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva Loan she will purchase more variations of toys for both boys and girls. She is planning to purchase and sell Barbie dolls, stuffed toys, war tanks, remote access toys and super heroes masks. She always wanted to keep these toys in her shop but her income was small. She also takes care of her ailing husband who needs a monthly routine check-up in which she spends a lot on medication. She is glad that Kiva will assist her financially in bringing growth to her business and allowing her to sell better and attractive toys.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to save money and give surgery in a well-reputed private hospital in the state capital. She thanks WSDS and Kiva for the love and support towards herself and the Chikim B Group. The rest of the group members are also engaged in poultry, weaving, piggery, and grocery.

She is the featured borrower for the \"Mimi Lom\" Group and she is pictured on the extreme left corner with raised hand. Their group is comprised of five women who live in a town which is about 60 km from the main capital town of Manipur, which is in the north-eastern side of India.\r\n\r\nZamdeihching is a very talented and fast learner when it comes to weaving. She used to be a paid weaver before she was married. After she was married, her husband bought a loom for her and she started weaving for her own income. Gradually, she started making a good progress and started supplying her woven products to the shops in town. Her hard work pays off with the trust she earns from her clients\/customers. In order to meet the demand she bought two more looms on credit and also started hiring paid weavers. With the profits she could successfully pay back her loan for the loom and also pay the hired weavers. \r\n\r\nShe says the demands are rising each day and she couldn't meet the demands of her clients with three looms and four weavers only. Therefore, with the Kiva loan, she will purchase one more loom. She is glad that she will be able to utilise her profits in buying different yarns and weaving materials while the Kiva loan will be used for purchasing a loom. She aspires to own a shop in the town market where she can sell her products. She says \"Thank you so much for the support Kiva\" and wishes a good luck.

Kalahandi district, one of the poorest regions in India, stepped out and decided to build a secure future for their family by sharing the burden of the family with their husbands. \r\n\r\nAll members hail from the Schedule caste and belong to the below poverty line category. The traditional work of this community is cobbler (making, repairing and polishing of different leather products). Normally this work is done by the male members. They formed a joint liability group named Hara Gouri. One of them is Surekha. The lady sitting second from the right with raised hand in the photo is Surekha. Surekha is 33 years old; living with her husband and three sons aged 16, 14 and 11. All three of the children are attending normal school. \r\n\r\nSurekha herself has been selling vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, brinjal, ladies finger etc., and seasonal fruits like mangos in the daily market of the town for the last 15 years. She brings stock from the local wholesalers. There was always some left-over stock that was not sold which had to be thrown away as they did not have a storage space of their own. So, Surekha decided to start selling these vegetables on her own by the roadside in the market. She now wants to rent a shop that will help her to have a place to sell the vegetables. It will also help her to buy more stock for starting a wholesale business. Buying more stock will help reduce her frequent travel to the market and eventually transportation and buying costs. A portion of the loan amount will help her to rent a shop in the market and purchase more stock of vegetables and fruits. Surekha hopes to complete the construction of her half-built house as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of her group are Chanchala, Sabita, Kumudini, Gouri and Premsila doing same business of vegetable vending.

formed a group named Maa Mangala to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their business. Bimala is one of them. The lady standing on the extreme right with a yellow color sari in the photo raising her hand is Bimala. She is 46 years old and lives with her husband and two sons aged 23 & 20. Her two sons are helping Bimala in running the business.\r\n\r\nBimala has been running an electrical goods selling business for last 10 years. Her elder son supplements in her business. She sells electrical goods like bulbs, wire, tube lights, frames, holders etc. Bimala was able to increase the variety of items at her electrical shop with the previous two loans from Mahashakti Foundation and increase her cash flow. Her monthly income from the existing business is 6,000 Rupees. Out of this small income she is hardly managing her household expenses. \r\n\r\nAs per the statement of Bimala she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase stock of her business. This is the third loan for Bimala and from this loan amount she is planning to purchase electrical items like bulbs, tube lights, frames, holders, sockets etc. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently. Bimala hopes to save enough for building a permanent house. The other four members of the group are Bijayalaxmi, Chandrakanti, Ratni and Malati who are running fast food center, tea and tiffin stall, tiffin hotel and betel shop respectively.

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Pazil will purchase calves.

She is married to Joselito, a driver and she is a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nMa. Elma operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php,50,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMa. Elma dreams of having another branch and hopes to have another source of income. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

When asked how this loan would benefit her family, Daizy replied \"it will help meet family needs.\"\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Daisy owns the following: cow and poultry, but does not own pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, and automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net and running water, but does not have electricity, solar power, a sewing machine, a TV, or DVD.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo

She has a life partner and three children.  She currently lives with her whole family in her mother\u2019s house.  This is because they suffered from some difficulties in her own house.\r\n\r\nAnalia sells nail polish, decorative boxes, decorations, wallets, hair clips, some clothing, toys, cotton, and mirrors, among others.  She has a display case where she places her products to offer to her customers.\r\n\r\nSix months ago she started with few products to offer.  Therefore, she did not manage to have good sales during the day.  This often discouraged her.  Nonetheless, she was, little by little, getting things in place in her small sales stand.  Now she sells a lot more than before.  What she likes most about her work is the happy moments of exchange with her customers, talking with them, and seeing them start the day with a smile.  She feels that the most difficult part is having to get up early, most of all when she is tired.  Nevertheless, she knows that it is her work, and she has to do it.\r\n\r\nShe will now request 1,000 soles.  She is very happy to know that she has a financial support.

She was born in an agricultural area that has good conditions for raising livestock and growing crops.  Dilnoza's family was poor and she helped her parents since childhood with raising livestock and growing crops.  Dilnoza herself has had a lot of hardships in life, because she lived in a poor family.  After finishing high school, Dilnoza married a livestock breeder and helped her husband raise livestock and grow crops.  They mostly raised livestock, purchasing livestock at the market at a low price, fattening it for a period of time and selling it at a high price.  Because of unfortunate weather and climate their business did not have positive returns.  Because of this, Dilnoza's husband plans to travel to earn money in the Russian Federation.  This is why Dilnoza turned to our organization for a loan for the purchase of a plane ticket for her husband; she plans to continue raising livestock.  Dilnoza hopes for your charity and mercy.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1353519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy an airplane ticket for her husband","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-05-23T01:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-22T01:30:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilnoza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1129.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550210},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1129.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228018},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1129.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459092440},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1129.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490821790}],"funded_date":"2013-05-23T14:46:57Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T12:01:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sabina Holzman","image":36162}},{"id":559265,"name":"Soda","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Soda est une femme mari\u00e9e et elle vit au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

They live together in their own home. \r\n\r\nGredel works in the sale of cosmetics including beauty products, perfume, and cosmetics such as talcum powder, hand cream, facial cream, lotions, compact powder, lipstick, and other feminine accessories like earrings, necklaces, and rings.

is 22 years old.  She is married, with no children.  Her husband's small income is not enough to provide the family with all the necessities of life.  Nodira has therefore decided to help her husband, for the sake of her family.  With this goal in mind, she has attended a course entitled \"Achieving Success\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and she has earned a certificate.  She is now fully ready to start her business and to be a successful entrepreneur in her chosen field.\r\n\r\nNodira wants to start her own business buying and selling livestock because she already has some experience in this area.

Narantuya, 50 years old, lives with her husband and two sons in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her husband has retired from work and gets a state pension. Her elder son currently stays at home and is unemployed and her younger son studies at the university. She has been selling various small sized items to local people since 2001 and accumulated a vast amount of experience in this business. Before this business, she had worked as doctor's assistant at a hospital for five years. She is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase goods from China. As a result, she can continue to run her business without worrying about an inventory shortage. Because her goods are small and fast circulating items, there is no worry she can't sell all these items.

He supplements his income with a small grocery shop he opened for his wife in 2009. They hope to one day have a considerable source of income to be able to supply the coffee factories directly instead of going through the middlemen, thus increasing their profit margins. His major challenge is having enough money to pay tuition for all his children; this has made him to work extra hard to ensure they all go to school. More so, he also has challenges transporting the coffee because he uses a bicycle.

She works at the business six days a week. She says that the main challenge to her business is sometimes her fish spoil.\r\n\r\nRegina has requested a loan to buy more fish for resale.

Robert has taken a loan from Nor Horizon for the ninth time and it is his third one from Kiva. All of them he has paid back successfully.

She has been selling clothing for one year.  Before she met her husband, Roxana was studying but she got pregnant and had to leave school.  Her mother-in-law encouraged her to set up a small general store so that she could make income to contribute towards the household expenses.  She currently also has a small grocery store.  Roxana feels very satisfied as she has her own business and doesn't have to neglect her daughter.  She gets up at 4.30am to do her housework and then works in her business.  She buys her merchandise in two large cities.  The journey she makes, by bus, is one and a half hours long.  Before she can catch the bus, she has a ten minute walk.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that Roxana is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will be used to buy two dozen pairs of women's trousers, two dozen blouses, eight dozen pairs of women's underpants in different styles, two dozen pairs of men's trousers, three dozen t-shirts, one dozen men's dress shirts and men's underwear.  This will allow her to increase the range of merchandise she offers her customers and the amount she has available.  She hopes to increase her sales and income so that she can save up and pay back her loan.  Roxana's dream is to graduate from university as a teacher (she is currently studying on Saturdays).

Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from their agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard, with 400 samples of wine trees. They produce wine and sell it at local markets at a good price. Besides that, they have a plot of land where nut trees are grown. They sell nuts locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Marine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit, Marine will open a grocery shop. As she has a space already near her house, she will purchase a stock of groceries. After opening a shop, she will work hard to increase the income of her family. Part of the income will be reinvested in the business. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1355939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a stock of groceries for a new grocery shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tabakini","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-23T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-22T13:50:01Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":112.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":115.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":122.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":126.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":129.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":133.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":138.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":141.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":145.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.21},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.47,"local_amount":104.55,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":105.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749741},{"amount":68.05,"local_amount":110.34,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":111.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613648},{"amount":792.48,"local_amount":1285.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1294.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857362}],"funded_date":"2013-05-23T17:50:25Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:00:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":563307,"name":"Andres Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Andr\u00e9s, se dedica a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda.

He lives in Zestaponi District with his wife, Maro, and his retired mother. Amiran requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nAmiran has a vineyard and a small plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. Harvested products are sold at the local markets. The family's additional income is from Amiran\u2019s and Maro\u2019s monthly salaries. Amiran is a fencing teacher, and he gives private lessons. His wife, Maro, is an accountant.\r\n  \r\nAmiran requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Amiran has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Amiran will purchase chicks. He wants to start a new poultry business and increase the family's monthly income. When the chicks are grown, Amiran will sell them at a higher price and earn a good profit. Part of the profit will be used for reinvesting in the same business and another part for improving the family's livelihood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1355960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To purchase chicks for reselling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Zestaponi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-23T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-22T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Married"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amiran ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":176.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":185.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":188.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":193.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":204.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":211.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":221.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":229.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":233.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":239.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.41,"local_amount":176.47,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":178.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749743},{"amount":115.01,"local_amount":185.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":187.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613650},{"amount":1325.58,"local_amount":2138.03,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:00:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2165.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857364}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T19:23:14Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:00:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":562513,"name":"Faith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For the past few years, Faith has owned a retail shop business, where neighbors and town dwellers are her potential customers.

He lives in a small village in Zestaponi District with his wife and two infant children. Eldar requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were always rejected, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese production. They sell cheese at local markets. Besides that, they have a one-hectare plot of land where maize is grown. It barely provides enough food for the family. According to Credo\u2019s evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Eldar applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Eldar will buy a minibus. After buying the minibus, he will begin trading in calves. He will buy calves at a good price and then transport them to resell at higher prices in different villages. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.
