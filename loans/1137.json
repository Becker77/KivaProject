Most of the members travel a long way to get to the city and it is very demanding. \r\n\r\nAndresa is one of the members. She has a small, well-stocked food store, where she has lots of things to offer her customers. She says that she was able to start it with a lot of effort and today she has a lot of customers.

years old David lives in the a small village of Chiatura district, Tsasri with his 59 year old wife Neli and 92 year old mother Nina.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nFamily runs an agricultural business. In particular, they own a vineyard and an agricultural plot of land. David cultivates the land seasonally and sows different kinds of vegetables. Harvested products are sold locally at the markets. Family additional income is David\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly pension.  \r\nDavid requested loan from Credo to start-up family business. David has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit David will purchase a milk cow. Neli will be milking the cow every day and producing dairy products. It will be sold together will the harvested products among the villagers and at the local markets.

is 29 years old. He lives in the small village of Sachkhere District with his wife, two sons and parents, who are provided with a retirement pension. George requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have 0.7 hectare plot of land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. Besides they have 6 milking cows, whose milk is used in dairy products. They sell the harvested products with dairy products at local markets at a good price. It is hardly enough on food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested loan from Credo to start-up family business. George has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit George will begin trade with livestock. He plans to purchase the livestock at wholesale prices and then resell at higher price. This will increase the income of his family. With increased income, he will be able to expand the business in future. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

who appears in the photo, is a 27-year-old single young man. Mohammad has had a barber shop, which is a profitable project and the only source of income to him, but also not much enough to cover all his needs.\r\nMohammad has took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing new mobile phone to his personal use. Taking this loan will offer to Mohammad new mobile phone, so he will be in contact with his family and his clients, which will improve his living condition.\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her husband is employed at the Ministry of Education who earns small salary, which is barely enough to cover the family's needs.\r\nBoshra wants to improve her house's kitchen condition, so she is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing and installing marble stone shelves to the kitchen.\r\nThis will make Boshra's movement in the kitchen more easier and fullfill her needs , which will improve her family's living condition positively.\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

this Summer, he has amount of money but not enough to cover all his necessary wedding expenses, so he is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing new bedroom furniture. Taking this loan will offer to Yehia comfortable furniture so he can enjoy living in his house with his coming wife.\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

All the members of this group are marginal farmers with small pieces of land. Kumari\u2019s husband works on his agriculture farm where he cultivates cotton and pulses (legumes). Kumari works in a rice mill as a daily wage earner. From the small income of 4,000 INR per month, Kumari barely manages all the expenses of her family. Due to this poverty situation, as of today they have not been able to build a good house. With her present loan, Kumari wants to purchase cement, bricks, etc. to renovate her mud house and create another room for her family. The other three members of her group are Bilasini, Sujata and Kasai who are also planning to modify their houses. All the members of this group are very happy with this good inventiveness of Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1356544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase cement, bricks etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BASUGUDA, RAYAGADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-05-24T02:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-23T02:40:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bilasini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suraja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kasai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-24T13:00:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":562851,"name":"Alpedita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alpedita is living in Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.

Juan studied through the fourth year of his secondary level at an institute in a town near his region.  \r\n<p>\r\nJuan has been growing corn, beans, and wheat for 40 years.  At the age of 15 he worked alongside his father, who taught him everything about farming.  He also works as a bricklayer and with his earnings, he was able to improve his house and buy cows.  In order to carry out his work of planting and harvesting corn, beans, and wheat, he relies on the help of his children but there frequent times when he has to pay a laborer who can quickly finish the work in a day.  His harvested crops are sold in the same region, which allows him to avoid transport costs.  \r\n<p>\r\nToday Don Juan is requesting a loan so that he can buy fertilizers, compost, bean and corn seeds for planting, as well as pay for a hired laborer.  He says that this loan will help him buy the seeds and supplies needed for planting, which in time will lead to a quality production.  Once he repays this loan, Juan says that he will request another one so that he can buy a breeding bull.  For the moment, he will finish clearing his land so that it will be ready for planting corn and beans.      \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1356254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers, compost, bean and corn seeds, as well as pay for labor.

within Kyamabare Village. They had been progressing but lacked farm inputs to enhance their productivity. When the Ugafode staff approached the area six years back, the members were excited because it would answer the cries of  the farmers. They gladly embraced the opportunity and have been acquiring and paying their loans up to today. Vangirista is particularly happy because she has been able to educate some of her children through selling tomatoes and bananas. Vangirista wants to say thank you to Ugafode and the Kiva lenders because she does not know what she would have happened to her large family of 10 children and a jobless husband without the support of loans. She will use the loan to buy organic fertilizers such that she can increase the productivity of tomatoes and therefore her income. The group has hard-working and honest members who are supportive of each other.The first four members, three of them holding forms on the front row from the left are committee members who are resting this cycle but have signed the waiver

They live in a Mongolian traditional ger on a plot of land. In 2004, he established his own monastery and began rendering religious services to local people. As time passes, the number of people who listen to his teachings increases. His son has a mental disorder and needs constant care from his mother. The ger they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. Because their ger is made of woods rather than felts, repairing and insulation is possible. He is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as planks, felts, fiberglass and foam. Using these materials, he can make wall insulation and roof repairs to his Mongolian traditional ger. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and thus contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1356651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

The main reason for the loan is that her husband wants to expand his business. There are currently two workers in her husband\u2019s tailoring center, working for him. He wants to hire two more workers so that his production capacity could be increased. For that purpose he requires two more new sewing machines and this loan would be used to purchase new sewing machines.\r\n\r\nSaima is very hopeful that after getting this loan her husband\u2019s business will flourish. As she is living in a rented house, she desires to have her own house. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

district of Battambang province, Cambodia. All of her children are dependent on her and still in school. She has struggled to feed and care for her children by farming rice on four-hectares of farmland. She has been in this business for ten years, while her husband is a fisherman. Together, they can earn about 20,000 KHR per day and manage to save about 12,000 KHR each day for the future.\r\n\r\nRat has been with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund, for one cycle.

She wants to purchase some more cosmetic products like make-up kits, facial scrubs, nail polish, etc., and chairs for her beauty salon. For that reason, Ansa has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan. On getting the profit, first of all she would repay the loan amount and then she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is too congested. She hopes that her business grows more and she is very much thankful to both BRAC and Kiva.

She has been running a business of selling art crafts for 12 years now.  She works from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily and is able to make a good monthly profit. \r\n\r\nThis is Hadija's eighth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.  She used the previous loans to buy more art crafts and has paid back all her loans successfully.  She used the profit to repair her house and to pay school fees.

She is a mother of three daughters. She adores her family and her husband works very hard so that his family can have a good and respectable life. Since 2000, her husband started selling shawls in the community which is the only source of income for the family. Presently, he is interested to purchase a variety of new shawls to resell at a profitable price. However, due to the lack of money he finds it difficult.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Samina has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband. He will use the loan amount to increase his supply of shawls  so that he can respond quickly to customer needs. He plans to expand his business with the additional income he earns. \r\n\r\nSamina hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

He is married an lives with his family. They are of low income. Sacarias works exclusively in agriculture and in his free time works as a laborer in different land parcels in his community to support his family. In the last harvest, he had problems with drought, causing poor production and product quality. That made his family income fail, as they support themselves with farm production.

She has had her business for over 5 years, starting with her own saving loan with which she bought a stove and gas tank to fry food. She plans to use this loan to invest in her businesses to increase her inventory by purchasing goods like flour, meat, plantains, potatoes, etc. She will use the profits to reinvest in her businesses and to provide for her family.

(True God).  This group is located in the city of San Pedro de Macoris.  Juana sells silver and gold jewelry.  This is the 12th loan she has requested from Esperanza, and she is planning to purchase more jewelry and clothes to expand her business inventory. \r\n\r\nShe is very excited about these loans.  They made it possible for her to start a business almost six years ago, and she is still running it.  She continues to expand her sales into more products and clients.

Juan Carlos wanted to avoid that and is investing in his Sistema Biobolsa biodigester to make sure he doesn't do the same. He will process the waste produced by his slaughterhouse to generate high quality biofertilizer and renewable, methane-rich biogas, reducing his impact on multiple levels: reduced agrochemical fertilizer usage, reduced fossil fuel use, and mitigation of environmental damage caused by properly treating the waste produced on his site.

Rampur town in the Kalahandi district of Odisha, India formed a group named Jay Sriram to take a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their businesses. Tapaswini, the head strong lady, is one of them. The lady standing on the extreme left in the photo raising her hand is Tapaswini. She is 30 years old and lives with her husband and two-year-old daughter.\r\n \r\nTapaswini has been running a Tiffin stall for the last 10 years with the hand holding support of her husband. Initially, Tapaswni started this business with her small investment. Gradually she developed her Tiffin stall business with the loan support from Mahashakti Foundation. As of today, she has taken three loans from Mahashakti and successfully expanded her business. The sweet items from her stall are very popular in the locality. Tapaswini gets a monthly income of 7,000 INR from the business. Out of this income, she is barely able to manage her household expenses along with her business expenses. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation.  From the present loan of 36,000 INR, Tapaswini wants to purchase more stock of oil, dough, sugar, etc. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she has to replenish her stock frequently. She also wants to use some portion of the loan to repair her Tiffin stall. Tapaswini hopes to save enough to build a good house of her own and give a better education to her only girl child.\r\n \r\nThe other four members of the group are Damayanti, Smitarani (who is running a daily needs and betel shop), Gayatri (who is running a medicine store) and Pankajini (who is running a barber shop).

His business is strategically located and well-trafficked. He has many customers who prefer to shop with him because he offers high quality fresh produce, good prices, and great service.\r\n\r\nMarcos is hardworking, dedicated, and anxious to succeed. He is always looking for ways to reach success.

He lives in Ikinu division, Githunguri district, Kiambu county, in Central Kenya. \n\nHe is a hardworking farmer practicing dairy farming together with tea farming on his two-acre piece of land. Proceeds from this work have enabled him to cater for his family's needs and pay for the children's school fees.\n\nHaving attended one of the trainings organized by Visionary Empowerment Programme, he learned that he could save a lot of money on fuel by having a biodigester at his home.

She earns a minimum of Php2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Ph10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMiriam hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams to give her children a good life and education.
