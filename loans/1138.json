She is married to Macario, a driver and is a mother to her children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRowena owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, from which she receives a boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nRowena hopes to have additional jeepney for her growing business and dreams of having a good and peaceful life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1357456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

She lives with her husband and one daughter, in a rural area located in the Moung Russey district, Cambodia. She is a rice farmer on two hectares of farmland. She has been a rice farmer for ten years, while her husband catches fish. The current business earns her family about 22,000 KHR per day, and she manages to save about 14,000 KHR each day after covering the cost of living.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan for Mao with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund.

She is a very hard working tailor who wants to expand her business. Parveen and her husband's biggest aims in life are to give a higher education to all of their children and to make each of them an independent human being in the future. But, because of financial constraints, it seems difficult for them to turn their dream into a reality. Parveen has applied for a loan from KIVA partner BRAC Pakistan for purchasing a new sewing machine so she can stitch up more dresses and satisfy the needs of her clients more professionally. She hopes, with the help of this loan, that she will be able to expand her business and reach her desired net income. That would enable her to provide a quality education to her daughters and son and fulfill all of their basic needs in the

She is 37 years of age and a divorcee.\n\nHer life was very miserable and she had to find a means to support her two sons who are 11 and 9. She doesn't have any source of income to give her two sons a proper and quality education, but with a little help from her brother and from her daily wages in the farm, she was able to enroll them in the local government school. After she was separated from her ex-husband she \nwent to live in her brother's house and there she set up a tea stall with a little help from WSDS.\n\nThe tea stall was her primary source of income ever since she started it, and she said that her business is a full time responsibility, because of which she is not able to take another job. And she said that she has to be content with the meager income from her stall. She wishes to expand her business by attracting more customers, and for that she needs to buy more stock like tea leaves, sugar, milk and some ingredients. She is hopeful that the loan from Kiva will help her expand her tea stall.\n\nShe dreams of having a house for her own and her sons after 5 years. And she is very pleased and happy with the help she received from WSDS. She also said that WSDS has changed her life and what is now today is all because of the initiative and steps taken by WSDS. Without their support and help her life would have been very miserable and she would be helpless. \n\nThe other group members are also doing their bit by setting up similar stall in and around the village and also by raising piglets and buying things from the wholesale market from the nearest town and selling them in the village.\n\nAll the group members are happy to learn that Kiva will be providing them the loan and they are all eagerly waiting for it."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1354989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to expand her existing tea hotel by buying stock like, sugar, milk etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bishnupur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-24T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-23T22:10:05Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hatlam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-26T10:55:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":563614,"name":"Parveen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parveen is a 31-year-old housewife who is the mother of four children.

He has been raising cattle for the last 10 years. He says this is a very difficult job. Taking care of animals is a continuous effort.\n\n Shalar usually buys cattle, raises them, fattens and sells them in the central bazaar. His monthly income is 120 AZN. This is the only source of income for his family. He plans to expand the business in order to bring more funds into the family. Selling meat is a very profitable business in Azerbaijan, due to its wide use in everyday dishes. \n\nShalar is applying for a loan of 1800 AZN in order to buy more calves. He believes this loan will have a positive impact on the expansion of his business. This is his third loan and he has a very good client

She is a mother of four children. She adores her family and her husband works very hard so that his family can have a good and respectable life. Since 2002, her husband has been running a crockery business. This crockery shop is the only source of income for his family. Currently, he wants to purchase plates, spoons, glasses, cups, and mugs for his shop, to offer more variety to his customers. By doing this, he will be able to increase his net income and savings as well. \r\n\r\nTherefore Sughran has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband. He will use the loan amount to increase his supply of crockery products, including plates, glasses, spoons, etc., so that he can respond quickly to customer needs. He plans to expand his business with the additional income he earns. Sughran hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

Beatrice also sells some of the bananas to generate income to pay tuition for her children.\r\n\r\nBeatrice will use this particular loan to buy organic manure in the form of cow dung, which she will spread in her plantation. This will improve the size of her bananas and also the quality of the plantation, helping to increase her income.

He lives in Pakistan with his wife, three sons and a daughter. \r\n\r\nHe owns a cosmetics shop in the market. His income is too low to cover their household expenses. Therefore he is planning to expand his business so that he can increase his net income and savings.

Due to her diligence Roza now makes 5,000 som (KGS) monthly profits by selling milk. Profits from her business made it possible for Roza to purchase a house for her family. In order to further develop her business Roza has turned to micro-finance bank \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 35,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to purchase more livestock.

","en":"Mullobobo was born in a remote village far from urban centers. He has turned to our organization for a loan for the first time in order to expand his business. Mullobobo works in agribusiness and he owns a grain combine and a small truck. He uses his combine to harvest grain for other farmers in the region and the truck for transporting the grain. This has been his source of income for 14 years and Mullobobo has a lot of experience. Also, his second son helps him drive the vehicles while his first son has been working as a migrant in Russia for over a year. Mullobobo's wife Sanavbar raises livestock and grows crops on their own farm. Mullobobo has turned to us for a loan of 5000 somoni which he will use to purchase spare parts and repair his grain combine.

Dilshod repairs private houses and has learned this trade in while working in Russia. He travels to Russia every year between May and October, and spends the winter fixing houses in his home village. Dilshod's family lives in his father's old house and he wants to save enough money to properly repair it. He also grows grain on one hectare of irrigated land and grows potatoes on 0.6 hectare. The profits from farming are used to support his family. As he is gone during the summer the main burden of farming and taking care of livestock falls on his wife Malika. Dilshod plans to go to Russia this summer as well, but has no money for the airplane ticket.

Nikolai and his family of three children all live in their own house which is still partially under construction. Nikolay has long planned to finish construction on two children's rooms since currently all of the kids live in one room and it's getting crowded. Nikolai's eldest son has finished first grade and needs personal space where he can do his homework and rest. For this reason Nikolai has turned to KIVA for a loan of 10000 griven, which he will use to repair two children's bedrooms and expand the available living space of the

After finishing high school Mirzorabi's son left for Russia to make a living and save enough money for his wedding. \r\n\r\nMirzorabi is now working the fields by himself and he gets very tired. But despite life's hardships he tries not to loose his spirit. Aside from farmland the family also owns a milk cow. Mirzorabi's wife takes care of her and milks her every day. She uses the dairy to makes various dairy products which she sells to her neighbors. The money from dairy sales is used to purchase necessary groceries for the family. Mirzorabi really wants to buy another milk cow so that he can improve the life of his family. Since his own savings are insufficient Mirzorabi has turned to \"Arvand\" for help.

He has experienced a great deal in his 26 years. Abduhamid was born into a large family. He is the eldest son and his parents have six more children. He has to help his parents because his father can't support such a large family by himself. It is the responsibility of the eldest son to help his father take care of his siblings. After graduating from high school Abduhamid attended driving school and completed it with a good grade. After receiving his driver's license he started to work as an independent taxi driver. His taxi service allowed him to improve his family's life and he himself was able to marry and now has two children. Abduhamid's wife is all day busy with the kids and household chores. His younger sister is now attending college and Abduhamid has helped her financially to make it possible. \r\n\r\nAbduhamid has turned to our organization in March 2012 for the first time. He used the loan to buy a minibus for his shuttle taxi service. This loan allowed him to start working. Now he is again turning to \"Arvand\" for a loan. Abduhamid needs to repair his minibus and purchase spare parts. He would like to add that it is due to \"Arvand\"'s help that he was able to improve his life. \"Arvand\" not only provides financial assistance but also helps to choose the right course for expanding his business. Abduhamid is very grateful to \"Arvand\" for the help and assistance in his life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1349643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy auto parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-25T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-24T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abduhamid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":138.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":143.18},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":147.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":152.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":157.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":162.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":168.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":173.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":179.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":185.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":191.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":197.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.88,"local_amount":281.8,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":284.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752029},{"amount":31.43,"local_amount":147.89,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":149.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616116},{"amount":32.46,"local_amount":152.76,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":154.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859986},{"amount":33.53,"local_amount":157.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":159.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136730},{"amount":34.63,"local_amount":162.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":164.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900925},{"amount":35.77,"local_amount":168.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":170.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550109},{"amount":36.95,"local_amount":173.87,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774334},{"amount":38.16,"local_amount":179.59,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":181.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673466},{"amount":39.42,"local_amount":185.5,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":187.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144259},{"amount":40.72,"local_amount":191.61,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":193.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960086},{"amount":42.05,"local_amount":197.89,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":200.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180858}],"funded_date":"2013-06-11T16:01:11Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T13:08:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":563854,"name":"Ruth's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group consists of eight members namely Ruth, Lydia, Diana, Comfort, Akuokor, Rebecca, Otoa and Fadi.

He has three children and has been doing farming for 12 years.  His primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and transportation services.\r\n\r\nHe stated that keeping dairy cows is the most enjoyable thing about farming. His biggest challenge is the fluctuation of milk prices and also production. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Eulita and Chepkuny.\r\n\r\nDavid was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied he was introduced to Juhudi by a friend.  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session. He answered, \"How a farmer can boost income by accessing financial services from a microfinance institution like Juhudi.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked how this loan will benefit his family, David replied it would diversify his agricultural enterprise by starting a horticulture project.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. David owns the following: cows, poultry and a motorcycle but does not own pigs, a pump, bicycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a mosquito net in the household but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1357993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She enjoys her business because it gives her more money.  She sells six days a week, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., and most of the time she uses a taxi to get her goods to her shop.

She also takes care of additional family members (her mother). She has a business of selling used clothes and has been in this business for 1-1\/2 years and has applied for a loan of 400,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more bales of used clothes. She doesn't have any other income generating activity. She moves door to door selling used clothes and sells on a retail basis only five days out of every week.

Her businesses are trading in bitengye and second hand shoes and tailoring. She works for eight hours in each of the seven days of the week. She also gets money from her coffee plantation. Her business is located in Ishaka\u2013Bushenyi municipality. She started the business to earn a living and take care of her family since she is the only breadwinner at home. She is going to buy coffee husks to decompose and put into her coffee and banana plantation. She will use the proceeds for school fees. Joan\u2019s clients are people around town and at the market since she always stages her business sometimes along the highway.

Instead she decided to do business. She works at the business throughout the week, 12 hours per day.  She says that her business is the only source of income she has.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to purchase traditional items such as calabash (gourds), fanner (lightweight woven trays), local pots and wooden spoons.

This group is located in Hato Mayor, a rural area in the Dominican Republic. Valentina lives with her long-term partner and her five children in a simple home in the rural village of Hato Mayor, where the cacao harvest is one of the main economic activities.\r\n\r\nValentina is an excellent Esperanza client and has successfully repaid seven loans. With this loan, her 16th, she plans to buy fruit and cacao. She sells in her community and to chocolate producers.

She began her business because she wants to help her family. She works at the business from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m., Morning to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nBaindu requires a loan in order to purchase more items like palm oil, bags of rice, soft drinks and cooking seasoning.

She works at the business 9 hours per day and 7 days per week. Sarah says that the main challenges to her business are the problem of transportation to travel with her goods and difficulty to travel during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nSarah has requested a loan in order to purchase charcoal and wood.  The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and educate her children. In the future, she plans to change her business to being a cotton seller.

She has been running this business since 2008. She works at the business every day, moving around the community to introduce her goods.  She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nHawanatu has requested a loan in order to purchase more cosmetics like hair cream, vaseline, powder and soap.

in South Texas. He understands the ins-and-outs of running a financially healthy business and how to reduce costs for himself and offer great prices for his customers.   \r\n\r\nWith Accion Texas Inc. by his side, he was able to secure a loan to purchase equipment and build cash flow to grow his business. At this point in time, he has six contracts lined up with another four in the initial stages of negotiations.  Francisco\u2019s expertise is laser screed, a self-propelled four wheel unit that ensures accuracy and precision in laying concrete.  The machine controls an area up to 1000 feet and guarantees a three millimeter accurate layout of concrete at each job.  \u201cMy area of business is growing and with better equipment, I get better contracts.\u201d Francisco said.\r\n\r\nBased in Brownsville, Texas, Francisco has the ability to work throughout the booming coast town and to work with other partners in the oilfield industry.  To secure more local contracts and grow his business in this area, Francisco worked with the Small Business Administration and Accion Texas Inc. to obtain his loan.  \u201cWith Accion, I was able to expand my business capabilities and give my employees a healthy paycheck and keep them happy.\u201d Francisco said.  Francisco also used the loan to pay for maintenance on his machinery for continued use.\r\n\r\nHis plans are to grow at a steady rate and purchase more equipment to sustain all current operations. His target markets are small businesses and large corporations that may need subcontracting work.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1358236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to secure more projects and pay for maintenance on his machinery for continued use","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Brownsville, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-05-25T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-24T13:30:03Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":564141,"name":"Rehana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehana is a 29-year-old woman.

She is a resident of Cabrera, Pasay, Philippines. She lives with her partner, and they both work hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMaricel operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Maricel's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she requests a 20,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy additional quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMaricel hopes to grow her business. She meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from her studies of the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Alabama through her business W. Preschool. \r\n\r\nThe Christian learning institution is a place where three- and four-year-olds can prep for kindergarten. It\u2019s a school Patricia describes as generational; the students she has taught in the past now have children she currently teaches.\r\n\r\nPatricia began working with children in the 1980s as a social worker, but then lost her job. However, it wasn\u2019t hard for her to get back on her feet. She was employed as a substitute teacher then as a teacher at different day care centers until she decided to open her own. \u201c(Teaching) is my calling,\u201d Patricia said. \r\n\r\nTaking her calling seriously, Patricia is strict to decide who can work with her. Today, she employs four part-time and four full-time workers.  Patricia describes her employees are life-time employees; some have worked with her until retirement. She plans to keep her preschool employed with the same familiar faces to provide a comfortable and trust-worthy learning environment.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of her preschool allows Patricia to continue accepting students. Her business has grown enough that she now needs to move from the home her preschool is housed in, to a larger facility. \r\n\r\nWhile talking to the person who completes her payroll, Patricia noticed the facility she is moving into needed a lot of work; that\u2019s when her payroll advisor informed her about nonprofit microlender Accion Texas Inc.\r\n\r\nShe applied and was approved for a loan to help repair the new building. Patricia needed three new doors, new locks, toys for the children and funds to cover the move.\r\n\r\nShe thanked Accion for the opportunity to expand her business and for trusting her: \u201cThe loan was truly a blessing for me. Without it, I would not have been able to move so soon.\u201d Patricia said.

The handicrafts that are produced there have been recognized on a national and international level.  This place is also known for its famous Panama hats.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis group includes ten women and two men who decided to join together some time ago to form a Communal Bank.  As a result, the loans they have received have helped to improve their standard of living.  Most of the members of the Communal Bank are artisans who make crafts out of straw.  One of the other members is in the retail trade.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne member of this group is Sra. Mireya.  She is 21 years old, married, and has a three-year-old daughter.  Her husband is an artisan.  Like most of the people from this area, Do\u00f1a Mireya and her husband make and sell Panama hats, which they do every day.  She enjoys her work and it is a tradition that has continued for many years.  The Panama hats are admired in many parts of Ecuador and throughout the world.  Mireya learned this profession from her parents and grandparents.  She has been in this line of work for five years and it has helped her move forward.  The semi-finished hats that she produces are delivered to Montecristi, where the necessary final touches are added before they are sold to the public.  Mireya\u2019s loan will be used to buy straw for making the Panama hats.  This is her second loan cycle with the Communal Bank and she enjoys the assistance that Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR has provided.  Her dream is to provide the best for her daughter.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe smaller photo shows two members who were not present at the time the main group photo was taken.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5600,"image":{"id":1339693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy straw for making Panama hats.

Therefore, it\u2019s almost impossible for her husband to earn an income. Rafia has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to pay for the costs of repairing the engine so that her husband can drive it properly. With the anticipated profits from his business, her husband hopes to buy one more taxi in the future.\r\n\r\nRafia desires to provide quality education to her children, and she prays for the good health of her family and for the growth of her husband's business.

She is married and has two young children with her husband.  They all live together in their own home.  Ingrid makes a living hiring out her mototaxi to a driver to use on the city's streets every day.  At the end of the day she receives a payment for the rental that allows her to cover household costs.  Ingrid started the business four years ago and her daily income has remained stable.  Before, she made a living making and selling bread but she left this business when she fell pregnant.  However, now Ingrid does not like not going out to work and so wants to open a small grocery store in her home so that she can add another income to the mototaxi rental.  Ingrid enjoys all the work she does and has no doubts about putting more effort in to work with a positive attitude every day.  Ingrid's big dream now is to repair another vehicle she has that is not used.  She wants it to be used for work so that she can add to her main source of income.  On this occasion, Ingrid is applying for 800 Nuevo Soles and is very happy knowing that she will have financial support so that she can continue trying to achieve her goals.  The loan will be invested in buying tyres and to repair the drive system on the mototaxi that does not currently work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1358303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy tyres and pay for vehicle maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-25T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-24T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ingrid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":126.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":126.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":136.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":138.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.94,"local_amount":125.4,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530586},{"amount":51.53,"local_amount":126.84,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":136.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975674},{"amount":51.34,"local_amount":126.37,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":135.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996942},{"amount":55.36,"local_amount":136.28,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":146.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864412},{"amount":56.33,"local_amount":138.65,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":149.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352780},{"amount":59.5,"local_amount":146.46,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":157.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904550}],"funded_date":"2013-05-25T22:29:55Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":564167,"name":"Rubina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rubina is 42 years old and a housewife.

They live with Neida in her own home.  Neida makes a living producing clothing items for men, women and children.  She patiently sews clothing that her customers order and she often produces her own creations.  She puts some of her own works up for sale in a small space in her home.  Neida has been doing this work for over 15 years and has always worked alone.  She tells us that she has never had a complaint from a customer and that she always finds a way to please them, so that they leave happy.  What Neida likes about her work is that she can express herself through the designs that she is inspired to create.  She also likes how easy she finds it to create something new and that this has made her one of the best seamstresses in town.  Neida always feels useful and hopes to build a much bigger sewing workshop in the near future and create a space just for selling her creations.  On this occasion Neida is applying for 1500 Nuevo Soles and is very happy to know that she will have financial support to progress with her business.  She also promises, once again, to make her repayments on time.  With this loan, Neida will buy materials, threads, elastic, buttons, zips and other accessories that are necessary for making certain clothing items that she will put up for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1358289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials, elastic, threads and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-25T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-24T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":235.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":237.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":237.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":255.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":260.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":274.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.16,"local_amount":235.21,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":238.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530585},{"amount":91.21,"local_amount":237.92,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":241.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975673},{"amount":90.86,"local_amount":237.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":240.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996941},{"amount":97.99,"local_amount":255.63,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":259.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864411},{"amount":99.7,"local_amount":260.08,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":263.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352779},{"amount":105.08,"local_amount":274.13,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":278.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904549}],"funded_date":"2013-05-27T02:36:00Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":564220,"name":"Teresita's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is 53 years old and lives in Matugas Bajo, Jimenez, on the island of Misamis Occidental in the Philippines.

She hopes that she can grow her cash-crop on time and earn more income to expand her agricultural business successfully."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1357792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and cassava seedlings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Ponhea Krek district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-05-25T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-24T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Touch","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1527434.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440092480},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T10:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1527434.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450135207},{"amount":127.78,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":509144.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459239928},{"amount":255.56,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1018289.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479282954}],"funded_date":"2013-05-27T20:12:53Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T21:33:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Seiji Humphries","image":null}},{"id":564074,"name":"Irma Leticia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Irma es una mujer de 42 a\u00f1os de edad casada y madre de 3 hijos los cuales juntos en familia se dedican a la siembra y cultivo de caf\u00e9 y granos b\u00e1sicos.

Irma is requesting a loan to purchase fertilizers to maintain her coffee crops and have an excellent harvest.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue to expand her crops to generate more income and continue investing in coffee production.  One of the greatest challenges is the constant increase in prices of supplies which are very helpful for ensuring that that they can use 100% of their production.

He grows corn and sorghum with a lot of dedication and this allows him to earn a living to support his household.  Rafael is hard-working, honest and responsible.  He lives with his family - his wife and 14-year-old son.  Alongside his wife, Rafael works very hard to help the family prosper.
