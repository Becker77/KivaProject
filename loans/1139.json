She lives with them at her parents' house. Kelly's work is selling typical dishes from the region. Every day when night falls, she sets up, outside her house, the necessary elements to serve her customers: tables, chairs and a kitchen. Her work begins early, with the purchase of necessary ingredients like meat, vegetables, rice, fish and more. Her mother has been helping her for a year and fortunately everything is going really well. \r\n\r\nWhat Kelly likes about her work is that it allows her to have enough time during the day to spend with her children and help them with their schoolwork.

She works as a farmer. Specifically, she grows corn and sorghum. She has been working in this role for many years and she has gained very valuable experience that enables her to get the best harvests. She sells in all the surrounding areas and has many stable customers. These people always prefer her produce because it is high quality and the prices are really affordable.

When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Regina replied, \"It will help me generate income to pay school fees for my children.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Regina owns the following: a cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle or an automobile.

From there, she serves her customers in a friendly and cordial manner, since she knows that by doing so she will gain their loyalty.\r\n\r\nShe works alone and it has been going well for her.  She has been doing this for 30 years.  In addition to selling drinks, she also sells food.  She considers her business very worthwhile due to the profits it brings her and the constant consumption of carbonated drinks.\r\n\r\nAt this time, she asks for 1,000 sols (US$400).  She is very glad knowing that she will have financial support, since she will feel more secure that she can advance her business.  She will invest the money that she's asking for to buy carbonated drinks of various brands and sizes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1359016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy carbonated drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-26T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-25T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":156.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":158.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":170.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":173.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":182.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.76,"local_amount":156.9,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":166.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530590},{"amount":63.48,"local_amount":158.7,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":168.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975679},{"amount":63.24,"local_amount":158.11,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996947},{"amount":68.21,"local_amount":170.52,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":181.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864417},{"amount":69.4,"local_amount":173.49,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":184.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352785},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":182.28,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":193.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904555}],"funded_date":"2013-05-29T06:00:37Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":564281,"name":"Natercia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natercia is taking a loan of $1000 to improve her business.

She lives in her parents' house, where they share their happiness and sadness as they constantly are trying to get ahead.  Llensy's work involves raising penned animals such as ducks and chickens.  She has a small farm where she is raising more than 100 birds.  When they reach the desired weight for consumption, she sells the animals in a market in the city or in her house, where potential customers come.\r\n\r\nEach animal that she sells earns her a considerable profit, which allows her to take care of the daily household expenses.  She has been doing this for 5 years and works by herself.  What she likes about this job is that it gives her independence and the ability to make her own schedule.  It is going well for her and she hopes that it continues to do so.\r\n\r\nHer main goal is to establish a large farm where she can keep a larger number of birds.

He lives with his wife and two children in a rural area located in the Ou Reang Ov district, Cambodia. He is a farmer who grows rice and cassava--he has been in this business for seven years.

Animals on the farm have not been named.\r\n\r\nRobert was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'it offers their products at low interest.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Good in the lives of farmers..'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'how will this loan benefit his family', Robert replied that it will 'improve living standards.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Robert owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, solar power' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD.'\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She also takes care of additional family members (grandchildren). Sarah has a business of selling charcoal and has been in this business for 7 years. She has applied for a loan of 2,000,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more bags of charcoal. Sarah generates additional income from hiring out a motorcycle and also from rental rooms. She works seven days every week and sells on both retail and wholesale at the market. Her major business challenges include transportation of bags of charcoal, rainy season which hinders her movements, and defaulters.

She also takes care of additional family members (nephews). She has a business of a retail shop and has been in this business for 10 years, selling to all types of people but on retail basis only. She doesn\u2019t have any other income-generating activity. She has applied for a loan of 2,000,000 Uganda shillings from MCDTSACCO to buy more bags of sugar, bags of bread, cartons of salt, boxes of soap, 100kg of rice, maize flour, and cooking oil. She works in a shop seven days out of every week.

Her parents raised her to know that she could do anything she put her mind to, and she dreamed of living many places and experiencing life to the fullest.\r\n\r\nAfter she and her husband, Ves, married almost three years ago, they wanted to take their experience in the food industry and create their own unique business. Her husband\u2019s Cambodian-American background gave them both a love for Southeast Asian food, in particular pho, or Vietnamese rice noodles. Their shared passion for food instilled in them a desire to provide quality service and experience, while contributing more to the community.  \r\n\r\nAlthough both Cindy and her husband loved the idea of opening a food truck, they decided to start small and opened a food tent instead.  Just last week, Cindy and her husband launched their food tent, Pho Realz. With this business, they can set up shop at local farmers\u2019 markets and share their love for pho.\r\n\r\nIn opening their own business, Cindy and her husband have faced some financial challenges, including finding the capital to start. Furthermore, she shared that their biggest struggle is getting the word out about their unique, local food tent. However, she enjoys the challenge and is committed to the long-term success of her business.\r\n\r\nCindy finds value and passion in partnering with the local community and giving back. She has already worked with a local artist to design their logo, and has a deep appreciation for a locally oriented, hospitable mindset. She hopes for the future that her business can continue to share a love of culture and give back to the community.\r\n\r\nWith your help, Cindy and her husband can pay for a vehicle to transport their food and tent supplies; also equipment and start-up food and licensing costs. Your contributions will directly enable Cindy and her husband to provide quality food at local farmers\u2019

He is single and lives in the city of Ica in the district of Parcona with this parents and his brothers. He is a friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who has a large desire to overcome. Unfortunately, due to lack of financial resources, and since he has had to work since he was very young, Marvin was not able to study the profession of mechanical engineering that he would have wished. In his free time, he likes to play soccer and sometimes cooks a delicious lamb stew to share with his family. Of his own initiative, with a lot of effort and dedication, Marvin works as a taxi driver, providing transport service in his city. He works every day for about 12 hours and believes that things are going well for him because he knows the areas where he can find the greatest number of passengers. Marvin is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the support provided he will be able to cover the costs of converting his taxi to natural gas. In this way, Marvin will be able to save a little more money using natural gas instead of gasoline and will be able to serve more passengers. So, he will continue working and exerting himself to achieve his big dream of having his own transport company. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1359191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to cover the costs of converting his taxi to natural gas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-26T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-25T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marvin Yuri ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":198.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":210.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":215.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":223.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":235.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":241.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":253.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":261.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":272.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":286.32},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":294.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":306.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.26,"local_amount":198.95,"processed_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":202.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664533},{"amount":80.69,"local_amount":210.48,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":214.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776100},{"amount":82.48,"local_amount":215.18,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":219.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779245},{"amount":85.76,"local_amount":223.72,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":227.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054429},{"amount":824.81,"local_amount":2151.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2192.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819338}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T20:51:59Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T12:54:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacqueline Demeranville","image":1016015}},{"id":564734,"name":"Mujeres Unidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Mujeres Unidas est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 2\u00ba ellas est\u00e1n haciendo la encuesta de eliminaci\u00f3n de pobreza para conocer la situaci\u00f3n de cada una, donde 3 de ellas  se encuentran por debajo de la l\u00ednea de pobreza procurando por salir adelante y crecer.\nUna de las integrantes es la Sra.

She is married to Diosdado, a vendor, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHelena operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

Kanibadam. She was born and grew up in a rural area. She is a young single mother. She got married early; after her son was born, her husband left the family and never came back. By now he has a new family and other children. Poor Ummatoy  was left to raise her child alone. She returned to her parents, but that was hard on her as well. Yet one has to go on living, if just for the sake of the child; dreams of a happy family strengthened Ummatoy and gave her hope. At first she started working at the local collective farm, and worked the land from morning till night, sparing no effort. She was able to save some money and buy a dairy cow. She has been fattening this cow for a while; now her cow has gained weight and brings in over 10 liters of milk per day. Ummatoy sells the milk and buys items of first necessity for herself and her little son.\r\n\r\nOn her girlfriends\u2019 advice, she reached out to Arvand for help. She would like to get more cattle. She needs funds for this, but does not have enough cash. Ummatoy plans to use her loan to buy cattle. She really hopes   to save enough money in order to buy an apartment and live separately from her parents. She thanks Arvand in advance for its support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1351719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy  cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-26T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-25T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ummatoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":482.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":498.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":515.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":551.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":569.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":589.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":609.21},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":629.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":651.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":673.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":696.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.65,"local_amount":482.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":483.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752032},{"amount":105.1,"local_amount":498.76,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":499.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616119},{"amount":108.66,"local_amount":515.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":516.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859989},{"amount":112.34,"local_amount":533.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":534.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136733},{"amount":116.15,"local_amount":551.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":552.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900928},{"amount":120.09,"local_amount":569.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":571.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550112},{"amount":124.16,"local_amount":589.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":590.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774337},{"amount":686.85,"local_amount":3259.64,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3266.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673469}],"funded_date":"2013-05-30T09:49:29Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":564808,"name":"Shirley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shirley is a widow with three children.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of 3-children. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. For many days his rickshaw has not been working properly, and because of that, he is unable to generate any income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Razia, as a member of a two-person group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

The current business, which she has been involved for 12 years, has returned her about 32,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nThis is not the first loan for Samoun with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She has successfully used her past three loans with success to upgrade her lifestyle in a good way and has fully repaid her past loans. For this loan cycle, she will spend her loan portion in the amount of 4,000,000 KHR to repair her house. She hopes that she can renovate her house on time so she does not need to worry about the upcoming rainy season, especially for her child.

He sells a variety of products in his store. Presently he is interested in offering more variety to his customers which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However, due to the lack of funds he finds it difficult. Therefore, his wife has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase cake, fruit cake, biscuits, bubbles, popcorn, nimko and sell them at the market at a profitable price. With the profit amount her husband wants to grow his business in the future. Riffat is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

He lives with his family which is made up of his wife and two children who collaborate in the sowing of the corn. They are a very united family. He is a very well-known person in the area, very friendly and respectful with the people who live around him. He is very hard-working. He also makes a living buying and selling animals, which he learned to do when he was young and his father taught him the work, and which he has continued to do up until today.\r\n\r\nHe buys his supplies in the nearest town, which is four kilometers from his house. In order to be able to buy supplies and food for his household, he also goes to a farmhouse nearby and buys animals that he will be able to sell. The transfer of supplies and animals is very difficult since it requires them to walk 8 kilometers. They must travel both-ways to be able to arrive at their destination.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will help him to buy agricultural supplies to begin to sow corn, since the sowing season is coming up and he has 35 square meters of land to work with, and to maintain his animals in order to sell them.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be very helpful to cover his needs because he does not have enough money to begin the harvest and the sowing period is approaching.

She lives in Lusaka province, Zambia, with her husband. She runs her own business, which is a Micro-Distribution Centre (MDC), where she sells Coca-Cola products at wholesale to local retailers and customers. She has been running her business for close to four years now.\n\nShena says she loves her business because it is a way for her to provide for her family rather than solely depending on her husband. When asked how her community benefits from her business, Shena is quick to say that her business provides to other small business owners in her community, a place where they can order soft drinks without having to spend any money on transportation to go into the town centre.\n\nToday, Shena is taking out a Kiva loan so that she can increase her line of products. Currently, she only stocks Coca-Cola and Fanta in glass bottles, on a very small scale. This loan will help her to add Sprite to her product line.\n\nShena has high hopes for the future. She dreams of one day being able to distribute a variety of Coca-Cola products, on a very large scale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1343771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To add Sprite to her line of products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":85.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":732.14,"local_amount":3853.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3873.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390712293},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":628.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399957716},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T21:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":628.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410241839},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T01:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":628.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429659128},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T16:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":628.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439893446},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T14:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":628.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449781093},{"amount":114.6,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":628.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.15,"payment_id":459261880},{"amount":112.54,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T18:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":628.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.21,"payment_id":468086415},{"amount":105.02,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T22:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":628.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.73,"payment_id":479303797},{"amount":110.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T21:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":628.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.37,"payment_id":491000260},{"amount":995.89,"local_amount":5521.64,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5549.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":53.22,"payment_id":504442316}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T05:21:42Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T19:43:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":555468,"name":"Nelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 26-year-old Nelia.

He lives in the small village of Bolnisi District with his wife, sister and parents. Ekhtiram requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from their agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of land, where potatoes and haricot are grown. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEkhtiram requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ekhtiram has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

She will also pay laborers for the application of these products and assistance with the planting once the seedlings have developed. This will ensure that she does a good job. She wants to take advantage of the good climatic conditions and fertility of the soils that her region has for this crop, and also to put into practice her various years of experience in planting basic grains. She also wants to buy the best quality products so that her plantation develops well and is healthy so that she gets a good harvest, and has good production in the short term. She will use the income from the harvest for her family's wellbeing and their studies, and to meet some family goals as well as to invest more in her crops. This is her first loan from FUDECOSUR.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Teimuraz will build a fish pool and purchase young fish.

Lom Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a five-member group and they called themselves \u201cJonlhing Lom\u201d group. They live in the northeastern part of India in the state of Manipur.  Jonlhing, according to the Kuki folk tale, was a very beautiful girl. Her beauty spread far and wide and people from different and far off places came to \r\nsee and admire her beauty. Her beauty was compared with the brightness of the sun and she was adored by all. Speaking of which, the group members truly represent the beauty and personality of \u201cJonlhing\u201d in their work because they work tirelessly and continually, hoping to bring change to \r\ntheir life and the lives of many people around them. \r\n\r\nThe profiled member is Neilhing who is on the extreme left of the picture with her right hand raised. She is 32 years of age and blessed with two sons and two daughters. They are a happy family and her husband has his own local electronics repair workshop in the village. He repairs all kinds of electronic gadgets in the village like cell phones, radios, TVs and tape recorders. But the money that he receives from the workshop is not enough to run the house and pay for the children's monthly school fees. So, Neilhing decided to open a tailoring shop in the village where she knits trousers, shirts and school uniforms. But still, this job is not enough to meet the expenses of the family, because she is able to get only a meager income from the tailoring shop. \r\n\r\nShe said that with the loan from KIVA, she will be able to buy more fabric for garments so that she can knit more and sell more. She also said that in this way, she can take more orders in advance and doesn\u2019t have to wait for the customers to go to the nearest town to get the fabric. This is also going to save a lot of time and money for the villagers and at the same time, people from the nearby villages will come to get the garments from her. In this way, she will earn more and save more for her family. \r\n\r\nShe said that over the next 10 years, she wishes to buy a paddy field of her own where she can grow wheat, grain and some cash crops in the field. Not only that, she wishes to continue knitting and expand her tailoring shop. The other group members are engaged in many other income-\r\ngenerating activities like raising piglets for sale, and opening shops in different location within the village.\r\n\r\nShe thanks KIVA for offering loans. The group members said that God has answered their prayers and for that reason, they all can fulfill what they had been dreaming of. They also thank WSDS for their endless support, and hope that KIVA and WSDS will continue to render their support in the years to come."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1354958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy more fabric to make garments to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T06:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T06:50:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kimnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinkhovei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T15:16:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":564976,"name":"Lelibeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lelibeth runs a sari-sari or variety store business selling various goods and items to the people in her place in Ubay, Bohol.

He lives in the small village of Martvili District with his wife, daughter, parents and aunt. His parents and aunt are provided with a retirement pension. Gocha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a pig and 0.8-hectare land, where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGocha requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Gocha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Gocha will purchase a milking cow. After purchasing a milking cow, they will be able to produce cheese products to sell. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Little did he know that his destiny would be cattle rearing, as people used to mock herdsmen as being illiterate and academic failures. Things hardened up when Benon became a single father of three; he remained with no alternative apart from joining a cattle rearing business, a job that would give him time to look after his siblings at the same time and keep him close to the home.

Alice did not go to school, and she has lived all her life in a rural area. Traditionally, she is married, and her husband is a farmer. They have six children together, the ages of whom Alice said she does not know; none of her children are in school. \r\nFrom selling her husband's farm products, Alice was able to establish her business. From 2002 she has been running a small local shop where she sells slippers and clothes. She spends 9 hours at her business a day, from Monday to Saturday. One problem that Alice faces is a small income. She is requesting a loan to purchase more inventory products for her business. Her plan is to one day build a modern house.
