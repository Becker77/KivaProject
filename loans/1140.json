They live in Nyarukika, a rural village quite distant from the main trading centers. John entirely depends on livestock farming as his main source of income. He has benefited from cattle rearing so much that he no longer relies only on proceeds from diary sales but also collects organic manure which he uses to fertilize his gardens and at times sells the excess to other farmers.

When he married and later got two children, he immediately sought a job as a school security guard, which his former schoolmates discouraged him from doing. However, he was determined to make life meaningful. \r\n\r\nTwo years later Gordeous embarked on a piggery project which turned all the odds into a bright future. He now owns a cycle taxi, a permanent house and his children are attending good schools. All his achievements have been attributed to hard work and being focused.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Gordeous is overwhelmed by the demand for pork and piglets, so he has applied for a loan of UGX 1,000,000 from UGAFODE to improve on his project so as to meet the demands of his customers effectively.

Genadi has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times so he can start a family business. However, he has not met with success. His loan requests were rejected because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family owns a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where fruits and vegetables are grown. They also have a milk cow. Genadi\u2019s wife milks the cow every day to produce dairy products. From the harvested grapes, Genadi makes wine. The family sells the wine, harvested products and dairy products to the villagers and at the local markets. \r\n\r\nGenadi has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Genadi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Currently she can\u2019t send them to good schools due to the financial constraints because of which she is very worried about their future. She has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan. \r\n\r\nShe is a very skilled woman and she wants to open a beauty parlor in her house to generate an alternative source of income for her family. She would purchase cosmetic products like lipsticks, creams, facial scrubs, makeup kits, etc. and would also purchase some chairs for her salon. She is very hopeful for this loan as she could start her business from this loan. She would spend the profit amount on the education of her children and to pay her loan installments.

Her husband makes his living as a daily worker whose income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family members. She faced many problems in her early married life; there were days when her children often slept without having any food. But now her contribution to the family income is playing a vital role in fulfilling the needs of the family members. \r\n\r\nTo cope with the increasing demand during the summer season, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a variety of clothing in different colors. She hopes to get an increase in her net income and wishes to spend part of the profits on the improvement of her house.

He lives in the small village of Martvili District with his wife and son. Guram requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 3 milking cows whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides, they have a plot of agricultural land where 400 nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested nuts at local markets at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGuram requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

learn how to raise chickens.\u201d Newly married, Nemneilhing is raising chickens now along with her husband! She belongs to <i>Sahei<\/i> JLG Group and she represents the featured borrower for the group. She is pictured with her hand raised. Poultry is a family business for Nemneilhing\u2019s in-laws. Her in-laws have now handed over the responsibility for raising chickens to Nemneilhing, and she is working hard to make more profits than before.\r\n\r\nNemneilhing and her husband both work side by side to make their chicken poultry farm a flourishing and successful one. She feeds them and also takes care of them. Since the family\u2019s main source of income is through selling the chickens, Nemneilhing also learns all the possible tips for raising chickens. She is very interested and hopeful that she will do great. The challenging parts, she says, are that the feeds are bought from the market, which is costly, and when the poultry is infected with contagious diseases. The loss is huge because the village is far from the city, and veterinary doctors can\u2019t reach them easily. The chickens are sold for profit when they are fully grown. They are sold in the village and in the neighbouring villages as well. Her husband usually takes the chickens to the town market too.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, she will purchase 100 more chickens. She says the income from the poultry business is the only source of income for the family, and it is not sufficient to manage the household expenses and run the business. She is glad that Kiva and WSDS are providing financial aid to help her raise more chickens and make more profit.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members have a piggery and vegetable selling business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1358557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase 100 more chicks to raise and sell for profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neihoithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heshing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimnunmoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhinghoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-28T04:33:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":565052,"name":"Tamaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tamaz is 32 years old. He lives in the small village of Terjola District with his wife, son, parents, brother, daughter-in-law and two cousins. Tamaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 milk cows and 4 calves, whose milk is used in cheese products. Besides that, they have a vineyard with 450 grapevines and a 0.9 hectare plot of land where different kinds of vegetables are grown. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTamaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan Tamaz will purchase a minibus. After the minibus is purchased, he will get orders to transport cargo and can generate income.  This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He lives in the small village of Terjola District with his wife, two children, daughter-in-law and an infant grandchild. Ramaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. Besides, they have a vineyard with 400 grapevines and a hectare plot of land where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the harvested products and cheese locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Ramaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Ramaz will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built, they will grow tomatoes and greens there. They will sell the harvested tomatoes and greens at local markets. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

George requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe family owns a vineyard. From the harvested grapes George makes wine and sells it locally at the markets to earn a small monthly income. Their additional income is George\u2019s father\u2019s monthly pension. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start-up family business. George has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit George will open a butcher shop.

The lands are located a distance of 800 meters from their residence, and they travel there everyday on foot in order to tend to and maintain the crop.\r\n\r\nToday, she is applying for assistance for the purchase of manure and fertilizers for the maintenance of her crops, since with this assistance, she will be able to protect her coffee crops to make them safer from infestations and other things.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve her crop day by day, and increase her harvests a bit in terms of variety and quality.

She has three children. Her husband is a laborer, and his income is not enough to meet his family\u2019s needs. In order to overcome the financial problems, Uzma decided to help out her husband by doing an animal sales business, and then she requested a loan from Kashf Foundation to provide full support to her family. She is obtaining her fourth loan with Kashf Foundation and strongly believes that she has improved her living standard and that her children are receiving a good education due to good income sources.

Her crops are located two kilometers from her house, and she travels to them each day on foot to care for them so she can prevent damage to her harvest.\r\n\r\nToday Rigoberta is requesting a loan to buy agricultural inputs such as manure and other fertilizers to maintain her crops. With this loan she will be able to protect her coffee and vegetable crops against insects and other pests.\r\n\r\nRigoberta\u2019s dream is to continue improving her crops so that she can increase the size, variety and quality of her harvests. She says that her children are her greatest priority \u2013 especially their studies \u2013 but also all of the other things that come up daily that her family needs or that can improve their quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1359863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs such as manure and other fertilizers for her coffee and vegetable crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rigoberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1325,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":25135.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118052}],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T00:21:36Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T10:41:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":565267,"name":"Ada Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ada es una mujer de 30 a\u00f1os de edad joven y madre de 3 hijos los cuales dependen de ella y su pareja en todos los aspectos los 2 mayores est\u00e1n en la primaria.

His wife is a seller in the local shop. They both receive small monthly salaries. Levan applied for loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Levan will purchase play equipment for children. He will place the equipment in the local park. The park has been newly renovated, and local people are spending a lot of time there, in the fresh air with their families.

In 2004, Osman established his local food enterprise in a busy market area. He began his business because he was trained in business and wanted to develop himself and his family. He operates his business from morning to night, seven days per week. At present he is facing problems with transportation from the provinces to his place of business. Osman is applying for a loan in order to buy more rice, local food (benni), and powdered corn, for resale.

She learned through family tradition how to grow coffee.  The land that she and her partner cultivate is their own, thanks to an inheritance from their parents.  The land is located 300 meters from the house where they live.  Norma walks there each day along with her partner and children to care for and maintain her coffee crops.\r\n\r\nNorma is now requesting help to buy organic and chemical fertilizers to maintain her crops, since with this support she will be able to protect her coffee plants.  With these supplies they will be more resistant to pests and other threats.\r\n\r\nNorma's dream is to continue improving her crops so that she can increase the size, variety and quality of her harvests.

She is married with five children, two of whom attend school. Mabel is a cattle farmer and carries out cattle fattening at Nyamabare \u2013 Kebisoni. This is her major source of income. She collects money from her farm milk and cow sales and with this income, she started constructing a house at her residence.

She has been selling fruits and vegetables that she and her parents grow for more than five years. Now she is selling cakes, enchiladas, candies, popsicles, chicken sandwiches, and soft drinks at the snack stand of a school. She wants to increase the variety of products even more, offering products like \"pupusas\" (thick corn tortillas stuffed with beans, cheese or meat). Her family provides her with some things that she needs for her business, but others she needs to purchase from a village four kilometres away, and transport is hard to come by.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy supplies to make different food items and improve the infrastructure of her stand, since things get wet when it rains. By buying more merchandise, she will avoid having to travel so often to the village and will thereby save time and money. Her desires are to send her children to school and that they finish university. She also hopes to expand her stand and grow it into a large store with basic products so that her customers don't have to travel so far.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1359941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will enable her to improve the welfare of her family. In the future, Lydia plans to build her own business empire, where all the basic, necessary requirements can be found in one place -- hers. She uses her profits to pay school fees, and cover household expenses. Her dream is to one day be able to build and finish a house.

It is a suburb of the capital city of Monrovia and one of the most populated areas in Montserrado County. The area boasts one of the best standards of living in the county with affordable rents, good roads, access to water and lots of transportation options. She is single with four children between 9 and 6 years old, all of whom live at home and attend school. The last grade she finished before getting to business is fourth grade. For the past six years, she has been selling pepper, bitter ball, okra, etc in the local market. She started this business with money given to her by her mother and she enjoys her business because the business gives her more money. She sells six days a week, from 7 am to 5 pm and most of the time she uses a taxi to get her goods to her shop. She is requesting a loan to purchase more inventories for her business. She plans to build a house and educate her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1359709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The group's members chose the name for the group themselves because there are coral trees growing in their local area.  Enedina represents the group and she tells us that she is 29 years old, has been married for a year - to a man named Romualdo -, and together with her husband they have a two children - one is already at primary school.  Enedina has had a grocery store for ten years.  The idea was Enedina's and it all started with her husband selling sweets from a wooden table but, little by little, they started selling groceries.  Now, Enedina is applying for a loan in order to buy more groceries such as detergent, milk, eggs, sugar, salt, seeds, tinned goods, drinks and bread, which is what usually sells most in the community.  According to Enedina, she has not had any difficulties with her grocery store but she says her dream is to expand the business and to begin selling cold meats and dairy products, such as yoghurts, again.  That way she will earn more and can improve her children's quality of life so that they can study to be professionals.  Enedina and, indeed, the whole group, are very happy and grateful to the institution as, thanks to the loan, they will be able to invest in their businesses.  Catalina, Juana, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Julia and Olivia will invest in raising yearling sheep.  Gregoria will invest in raising pigs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":1346349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She deals in buying and selling charcoal, a major item that is in demand by many of the low-income earners because it's affordable. The purpose of the loan is to buy more sacks of charcoal for her business. Her challenge is weather because during the rainy seasons, vehicles cannot go to villages to collect charcoal. This leads to delays. The high tax rate and high transport charges are some of her other challenges. However, she has been able to earn a living from her business and to look after her children.

Annie operates a cook shop (restaurant) selling rice and soup in the Sinkor area of Liberia.  It is a suburb of the capital city of Monrovia and one of the most populated areas in Montserrado County. The area boasts one of the best standards of living in the county with affordable rents, good roads, access to water and lots of transportation options. \r\nShe is married and has five children, between ages 10 and 16. Three are currently attending school and two of them live at home. She completed 6th grade before starting her business. She describes herself as a good business woman.\r\nAnnie has had a cook shop business for the past 21 years. She works 12 hours a day, six days a week at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is that during the rainy season she hardly gets customers. She intends to use the loan to buy more rice, pepper, fish, charcoal, etc. She started her business with help from her husband who sells charcoal. She likes her business because it helps her buy some items for the home. In the future, she wants to own a house.  \r\nShe wants to thank the lenders for supporting BRAC Liberia and its borrowers.

The city has a sizable population of Dominicans and Haitian immigrants who live in communities with very limited resources.\r\n\r\nInes is very excited to receive her fourth loan from Esperanza International, having satisfactorily repaid her previous loan and taken an important step in her business's growth. She has had her business for about six years. She started it with her own capital, after she saved money by doing different jobs. She is running a shoes sales business, and she is planning on investing the new loan in buying many dozens of tennis shoes, sandals, sneakers and casual shoes for women, kids and men. She sells the shoes by walking around, from her house, and from a place in a flea market once a week.\r\n\r\nInes\u2019s family is made up of herself and her two children. She tells us that her greatest challenge is to have her own house. She really enjoys working and taking care of her children.

She has been part of this group for almost five years, and with each loan she has been able to improve her business.

To overcome this situation, in the year 2010 six women of this community formed a Joint Liability Group named Maa Mangala with the objective of accessing a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the overall development of their family, to improve their existing businesses. Archana, aged about 35, is the featured member, sitting on the extreme left with raised hand. She is married and resides in a small hut with her four-member family, comprised of her husband and two daughters aged 8 & 4.  \r\n\r\nThe business of Archana (making of bamboo hand fans) is a traditional business of their community. Archana and her husband jointly do the processing work and make hand fans. To procure raw materials, they have to go 100 kilometer away by train and bring back the raw bamboo. Both the wife and husband sell their products in the town market, railway station & bus station. They also supply their products to traders. \r\n\r\nArchana earns a monthly income of Rs.3000 from her business. This small income never meets the minimum needs of the family. So Archana wants to raise her production for more income. From the present loan she is planning to purchase more raw bamboo to last for a long time without any interruptions. She hopes this will help her to increase her income. Archana dreams of revamping her existing hut and constructing a house for her family.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Pakani, Nandi, Santi, Dali and Radhika who also do the same business. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1359847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing bamboo and coloring.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T20:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T20:10:01Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Archana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pakani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Radhika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nandi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":76000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":76000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-30T02:32:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":565290,"name":"Hayel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hayel, who appears in the photo, is a Palestinian single young man.

The special identity of this slum area is that it is inhabited by the Mahar community (Weavers of Bamboo).The inhabitants of this community are very poor and far away from the basic necessities of life like shelter and education. They reside in small huts and their children can rarely get a good education. \r\n\r\nThe main business of this community is making hand fans of bamboo and selling them in the market, railway station and bus stand and nearby villages. The income they get from this is hand-to-mouth for them. To overcome this  situation, in the year 2010 six women of this community formed a Joint Liability Group named Mirabai to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to add some extra income for their family so as to improve their existing status. Bisaya, aged about 41, is one of them. The lady sitting second from right with raised hand in the photograph is Bisaya. She lives with her husband, one son of 25 years and two daughters of 20 and 18 in a small house. \r\n\r\nBisaya is doing her traditional business of bamboo crafts (making bamboo hand fans).All Bisaya's family members do the processing work and make hand fans. Bisaya procures the raw materials from a distant place, 100 kilometer away. Bisaya sells the finished products in the town, railway station and bus stand. She earns a monthly income of 5000 INR from her business. This small income is barely enough for Bisaya to manage her family expenses. So to meet the expenses smoothly, Bisaya wants to increase the income of her family. From the present loan she is planning to purchase raw bamboo and coloring for making more hand fans. She believes that this will help her to increase her income level to some extent. Bisaya dreams of repairing her house and constructing another room for her family.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Gulapi (running a rice business along with tailoring) and Labani, Rabi, Gita and Sonia doing the same business of bamboo hand fan weaving. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1359864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing bamboo and coloring","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Gulapi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Labani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bisaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":76000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":76000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T22:08:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":565336,"name":"Natividad De Maria Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Natividad de Maria est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 1\u00ba del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres est\u00e1n aprendiendo a trabajar juntas y tienen como meta crecer y ayudar a sus familias por medio del trabajo en conjunto.\nFlora, una de las miembros, se dedica a la venta ambulante de frutas, ella es una persona muy trabajadora, que vio como una gran oportunidad la de formar parte de este grupo, ya que podr\u00e1 mejorar su econom\u00eda y tambi\u00e9n recibir capacitaciones para poder crecer como persona.\nLa Sra.

Her family migrated to this town in the last 40 years from the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh in search of employment and settled here permanently. \r\n\r\nSimanchlam is running a goldsmith business in her house with the active support of her husband. Her elder son also helps his father. This is the traditional business of her family. They make different designs of ornaments and do polishing work by using traditional methods. From this business she earns a monthly income of 4000 INR with which is very hard for Simanchlam to manage her family's expenses. So she is thinking to increase the income of her business by adding some design machines and new accessories to her workshop. This will help her to get more output in less time and generate more time to work. \r\n\r\nFrom the present loan Simanchlam is planning to purchase an ornament-designing machine and some goldsmith accessories. Simanchlam hopes to open another workshop in the town for her sons in the near future.

They will use their $10,000 Kiva loan to finish the plumbing, as well to finish furnishing and stocking the shop with initial inventory for opening.\r\n\r\nThere is already a lot of interest from the community that is eager to welcome this new coffee bar to the scene.

Jose sells auto parts such as spark plugs, chains, bearings, and other things.  He also repairs vehicles, fixes engines, electrical systems, and other things.  He does this work in a workshop at his home and has been doing this for many years.   He gets help from his son, another helper, and an apprentice from a school.

He is from Tajikistan, 55 years old, married, and the father of four children. He has been farming crops such as onions, watermelon, and wheat for over six years. He sells the harvest at market, where there is high demand for his quality produce. His wife helps with the business too.

She is not married and lives with her parents. A year ago, in order to support her family she began her own business selling women's clothing and fabric. At first she worked as a seamstress of women's clothing, but she did not make a good income so she switched to selling instead. Her brother helps run the business. She sells goods at the local market, and she tries to provide clients with high quality. She is planning to buy goods for the next season, but does not have enough funds so she is asking for a 7500 somoni loan to buy new merchandise. She is grateful for your generosity. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1359473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy clothes and cloth for the new season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulhumor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":304.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":349.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":338.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":342.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":370.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":381},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":397.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":395.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":428.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":435.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":444.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":451.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":472.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":482.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":496.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":512.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":525.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.21,"local_amount":305.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":310.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693595},{"amount":74.63,"local_amount":349.84,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":354.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556421},{"amount":1460.16,"local_amount":6844.49,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6944.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550255}],"funded_date":"2013-06-24T07:57:54Z","paid_date":"2013-09-21T08:57:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":565437,"name":"Santo Domingo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Santo Domingo est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 2 del programa de comit\u00e9, donde todas trabajan y se ayudan por salir adelante.

He lives far from the city, but has had a wonderful idea, to expand his business. His name is Rustam, and he is 43 years old, married, and the father of four children. The climate in his area is great for growing crops, as well as raising livestock. For the past three years he has been raising animals, primarily small livestock, though he does have one cow. He has a large garden where he grows hay for the animals. He sells the animals after he has raised them for a number of months. He has many customers at the market. Rustam would like to expand his business but he doesn't have the necessary capital. He is asking for a 3000 somoni loan to buy 6 head of small livestock. With the income he earns from the expansion he wants to provide his children with a good education and modern technology. He is grateful for your generosity. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1359504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cattle for developing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-05-27T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-26T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rustam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":204.8},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":224.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":223.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":241.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":244.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":251.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":260.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":265.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":277.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":284.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":292.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.58,"local_amount":205.75,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":212.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693596},{"amount":49.17,"local_amount":226.94,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":233.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556422},{"amount":48.67,"local_amount":224.63,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":231.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550256},{"amount":49.44,"local_amount":228.17,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":235.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410959222},{"amount":52.75,"local_amount":243.48,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":250.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075383},{"amount":52.62,"local_amount":242.84,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":250.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228057},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":251.98,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":259.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989026},{"amount":56.53,"local_amount":260.91,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":268.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449625964},{"amount":57.48,"local_amount":265.27,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":273.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459092466},{"amount":184.16,"local_amount":850.03,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":875.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468204390}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T18:43:22Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T09:28:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":565439,"name":"Mariela Irene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mariela es una joven muy trabajadora y emprendedora, gracias al esfuerzo que ella ha hecho esta saliendo adelante.

She is married with two children aged two years and seven years-old. One of her children is currently attending school. In 2008, Kadiatu established her fish business. She began her business because she needed to create her own source of income instead of depending on her husband alone. She works at the business eight hours per day and six days per week.  She says that the main challenge to her business is transporting the fish which is very difficult as sometimes vehicles break on the way.  \r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to purchase more fish to resell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her child's school fees. In the future, Kadiatu plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1360109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

He was born in 1965. He has extensive experience in animal husbandry. His father raised livestock and Atamjon helped him from a young age. Now it is his livelihood; he has grown up and followed in his father's footsteps. He began his business with five head of sheep. It wasn't easy at first, especially in winter. But with years of experience he came into his own and found his way to methods and decisions to improve his work. Today he has over five head of cattle, and recently bought a female cow. His wife and five children also help. In addition to animal husbandry Atamjon also works as a contract laborer to earn more money for his children's education and daily expenses. Because of the season he cannot currently sell his animals, as the price has fallen. Atamjon needs additional capital for further feeding and to purchase new animals. With this goal he came to Arvand for a loan. He is planning to use the loan to buy livestock and feed. He is grateful to Arvand for their support and the huge role they play in his life.

Garik successfully sells his handmade souvenirs and paintings at the Kapan market but the income is sometimes not enough to cover all the needs of his family, that is why he has asked for a loan of 900.000 Armenian drams in order to buy machine-tools, raw materials (wood) and different tools that he needs.

Her husband is a driver and works in a taxi service in Kapan. \r\n\r\nAs her nursing salary is too low, Arevik decided to run her own business in Kapan. Last year, Arevik rented a stall in the Kapan clothes market and started to sell children's and women's clothes, which she buys from the Yerevan wholesale markets and transports to Kapan with her husband's support once a month. Arevik is very appreciated by her new occupation and as she confessed, the trading business is more profitable. Profit from the business allows her to meet her family's needs. At the same time, she couldn't give up her medical profession, and from time to time, she helps people in her surrounding area if they need it.\r\n\r\nArevik asks for a loan from Kiva to buy a new assortment of women's and children's clothes for the summer season in order to sell them in her stall in the Kapan clothes market. She hopes that this first deal with Kiva will be very successful and profitable for her.

For the past five years, Zahr's husband has had a grocery store, selling different types of groceries. This has been a profitable project but it does not generate enough to cover costs.\r\n\r\nZahr is requesting a Murabaha loan (see below for explanation) from Palestine for Credit and Development to help her husband purchase the basic groceries that customers often request, such as rice, sugar and milk, and to improve the store's condition with the installation of additional shelves.

The lady in the middle with the raised hand in the photograph is Ranjita.\r\n\r\nRanjita lives with her husband and two sons, who are 6 and 4 years old. To work and earn some income, Ranjita started a home shop business five years ago with her own investment. In 2010, when Ranjita got confidence in being able to run this business, she and five other like-minded women of her locality formed a group named <i>Maa Tarini<\/i> for availing loans from Mahashakti Foundation to develop their businesses.\r\n\r\nRanjita specially sells ladies fancy items like bangles, talc, plastic items, cosmetics, ornaments, etc., from her house. Apart from that, she has a tailoring machine stitching ladies garments. Ranjita buys stock for her home shop in her town. Presently, she is selling fancy items worth 300 Indian rupees (INR) to 500 INR per day, from which she gets 15 to 20% profit. From this small income, she barely manages her family's expenses. So, she wants to increase the volume of her business to increase her income.\r\n\r\nWith this present loan, Ranjita wants to purchase ladies fancy items and different varieties of bangles. Ranjita is confident enough to have a business of her own and hopes to give a better education to her two sons.\r\n\r\nThe other five energetic group members are Ful, Kousalya, Nirupama, Duhita and Saibalini who are running a carpenter and meals supply, broiler, meals hotel, vegetable vending business and tailoring centre respectively."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1360145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing bangles, talc, plastic items, cosmetics, ornaments, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ful","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kousalya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nirupama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Duhita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saibalini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":84000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":84000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-09T01:16:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":565474,"name":"Carlos Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos Alberto de 38 a\u00f1os de edad, considera que haber creado su propio negocio ha sido la mayor bendici\u00f3n que ha recibido. \u201cGracias a esta fuente de empleo hoy mi familia tiene un futuro mejor\u201d estas son las palabras con las que Carlos narra su principal motivo de felicidad.\nAsegura que las ventas en el sector son buenas y que lo \u00fanico que le ha preocupado son algunos clientes que no cancelan la cuenta.

The lady standing in front in the photograph with her hand raised is Jyotshnarani. She is 24 years old and lives with her husband and seven-month-old daughter. Jyotshnarani\u2019s husband has been running a multifarious business that includes a photocopy center, stationary store, thread wholesaling and a cloth center for the last 12 years. After marriage, Jyotshnarani has been helping her husband. All these trades are running under one roof. Jyotshnarani gets a monthly income of 7,000 INR from the business. Out of this income, she is barely able to manage her household expenses along with her business expenses. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. From the present loan, Jyotshnarani wants to purchase more stock of cold drinks, stationary, thread and blouse pieces. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she has to replenish her stock frequently. Jyotshnarani hopes to save enough to start a kid\u2019s readymade garment shop and give a better education to her only girl child. The other four members of the group are Laxmi, Ramita, Labanya and Haripriya who are running a fancy store, a book stall, a Tiffin and meals hotel and a photo studio,

Mahbuba also raises cattle at her home and she has a great amount of experience in this area - it brings in some extra money for the family budget.  For Mahbuba, raising animals is not just her work, it is a pleasure.  At the moment, she wants to buy cattle to raise, but she doesn't have enough money for this and she has turned to Arvand.

","en":"Mahbuba is 35 years old and she is married with one child.  She comes from a family of civil servants; her parents are teachers and after finishing high school, Mahbuba followed in her parents footsteps and enrolled in the pedagogical institute in 1994.  On graduating from the institute, she started working in a high school in the Spitamen region.  Mahbuba's husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation.  Since the salaries in the school system are very low, she had to quit her profession and start working in a shop.  For more than six years, Mahbuba has been selling women's shoes in a local market.  She is a very responsible and conscientious woman with strong willpower.  She needs money to increase her trade, so she has turned to Arvand for help.  Mahbuba wants to expand her business and she will use this loan to buy a new assortment of women's shoes.  She thanks Arvand for their great support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1353369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She lives with her partner and is the mother of five children who are still dependent.  The family live in their own home.  Digna completed her primary education thanks to the efforts and determination of her parents who wanted her to have a basic education.  However, she was not able to continue her education as her family did not have enough money.  Digna has a lot of farming experience as she has been growing bananas, coffee, plantains, beans, corn etc. for 20 years.  Her customers are different buyers who come to her area, as well as neighbors and friends who know that she grows good quality produce.  Digna and her partner own the lands that they sow as they worked hard for many years to buy them.  They are located 500 meters from their home and they travel there on foot.  \r\n\r\nDigna is currently requesting help to buy manure and fertilizers with which to maintain her crops.

","en":"Husan was born and raised in the countryside. He has been interested in business since he was a boy. After graduating from high school, he did not go to college because it was not possible for him. Husan is married and has five children. His wife is a homemaker, but she helps him feed the cattle and sell dairy products to people in their neighborhood. Since Husan is the provider for the family, he started to get involved in retail sales. At first his business was very small. He dreamed of expanding his business, but he didn't have enough money to do this. In 2005 he turned to Arvand. Over the next eight years, with Arvand's cooperation, he improved his business, and thanks to a loan opened a new retail location for selling food products.

She is living in Rawalpindi, Pakistan with her husband and 2 daughters. Her husband is a janitor by profession but his monthly income is not enough to cover the household expenses of his family. Therefore, for the past 7 years, with the profession of security guard he also drives a taxi at night. But currently he is not able to generate any income from the taxi, as its engine is not working properly and needs to be repaired. \r\n\r\nMahvish, as a member of a three-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to meet the amount of repairing the engine of her husband's taxi. With the profit, her husband wants to open a new auto mechanic shop in the future. Mahvish desires to provide quality education to all her children, and she prays for the good health of her family and for the growth of her husband's business. She is very much thankful to Kiva and BRAC.

He harvests the products and sells them locally at the markets to earn small monthly income.\r\n\r\nZurab requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Zurab has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Zurab will cultivate the land. After the land is cultivated he will plant tomatoes and melon seeds. He will work hard to insure a good harvest and soon will be able to sell the products at the local markets at a good price.

","en":"Inomchon lives in a rural village, not far from the city. He lives together with his mother. His father died a long time ago, when Inomchon was 8, leaving them alone. His mother raised the children by herself, which was very difficult. So now he is all grown up, and is already 36. He is married and has three children. He built his family on his own. Because of his circumstances, he could not go to college; his mother needed his help at home. But he graduated successfully from high school. He has worked on a collective farm since he was young, and has always loved animals. When he was still a young boy, he used to feed the cattle together with his father. Now whenever he feeds the cattle, he is reminded of his father. Right now Inomchon works at the collective farm and is also raising cattle. His capital has decreased because of family difficulties. Now it is his busy season, and he wants to increase his number of animals. For this he has turned to Arvand for a loan. Incomchon plans to use the loan to buy a cow and expand his business, which is very
