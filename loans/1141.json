Her clients are very happy and well satisfied with her work.\r\n \r\nShe has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to expand her business. She wants to open a tailoring centre in her house. She would purchase two new sewing machines so that her production would be increased. She would also purchase some threads and cloth. She would pay her installments with the profits and also pay some household expenses. She is very hopeful that the loan will help her family to progress.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a mother of six children. Her husband is the only earning person in the family. He owns a spice shop which is the only source of income for the family. His monthly income is inadequate to meet the household needs. \r\n\r\nPresently, he is in need of purchasing spices for his shop that include chili, ginger, cinnamon, parsley, thyme, cumin, rosemary, saffron, turmeric, and crushed red pepper flakes. However, due to the lack of funds, he finds it difficult. Therefore, Walayat as a member of a 3-person lending group has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase the needful things for her husband's shop. \r\n\r\nHer husband's work depends upon electricity because he has to grind the spices for sale and there is a huge loadshedding issue (regular power outages) in the area. Walayat prays that this issue will soon resolve so that her husband can continue his work efficiently. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

This is a very fertile area known for its productivity and located at the slopes of Mount Kenya. She is married and has three children, all of whom are in school. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing farming for seven years. Her source of income is coffee, bananas, maize and beans.

She is from a town which is steeped in history and tradition, where people eat well.  Elena is part of a group of people who are requesting loans to improve their businesses.  Her group is called Moralito and she says that they named the group after the neighborhood where they meet once a week to make their loan repayments.  Elena has participated in several loan cycles with Visi\u00f3n Fund and she says that she likes belonging to this financial institution because it is serious and respects its clients.  \r\n\r\nElena grew up helping her parents on their stall selling strawberries and cream, fries, fried pork rinds, pancakes, prepared plantains, different flavors of filled churros, etc.  They would set up their stall wherever there were open air markets or public celebrations in surrounding communities and also in their own town.  She says that eight years ago she decided to set up her own business so that she could provide for her family.  She has two children who are currently in elementary school.  Her husband is an employee but sometimes helps her out in her business selling fried food and snacks.  \r\n\r\nElena is requesting a loan to buy the supplies she needs to make her snacks.

","en":"Mavzuna was born in Kanibadam.  She enrolled in university after finishing school and finished with good marks.  She got married afterwards, but her jealous husband would not allow her to work.  Mavzuna resigned herself to the fact that family is more important than a career.  They were happy, but her husband had to leave for Russia to find work, as he wasn't able to find good work with a decent salary at home.  Mavzuna was left with two children, the youngest of whom was only a year old, and she had to work at home herself and also find money on which to live.  She began to bake pastries, buns and all kinds of sweets at home to sell to local shops, and in return bought flour and other ingredients.  In this way, she increased the income of her business.  Now Mavzuna is already a professional baker.  She has opened her own stall at the local market to sell her sweets, and now she needs to buy a big oven so improve the quality of her buns.  She has turned to Arvand for this.  Mavzuna is very happy that, with the help of a loan from Arvand, she is able to have a decent income and improve her living

","en":"Aziz is a young man of 23 years who is married and lives with his wife and parents in the city of Isfara.  He spent a year selling dried fruits in Russia, and now he wants to work in his own country and start his own business there.  He is asking for a loan to construct a shop near where he lives.  Aziz already has part of the building materials (sand, cement), but he plans to use the loan to hire construction workers and to buy the building materials and shop fittings he is missing.  He has some savings that he started from his work abroad, and he plans to use that to buy furnishings for the shop - a refrigerator, shelves, etc, as well as products to sell.  The village where Aziz lives does not have a market other than kiosks and shops with a small assortment of goods at high prices.  This gives him a good advantage, as there is less competition.  Aziz's wife will help him in the shop.  He is counting on your support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1360538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy building materials for a shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aziz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":837}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":565638,"name":"Shareefan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shareefan, 45, is a married woman.

He lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia with his wife and parents. His parents have a retirement pension. George requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGeorge has a Donner fast food in the capital city. This is his only source of income. George requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. George has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit George will purchase a special apparatus for beer, which will be placed in his fast food and George will offer his clients an additional product.

I have two children, aged six and four years old. I am married and my wife runs a farm. When I competed high school in 2002, I did not have money to go to college and so I sold small things in the streets. Street-vending made me the person I am today because I came to learn a lot of things about life and about business. \r\n\r\nWhat will you use the Kiva loan for?\r\nI will use the Kiva loan to add to my operational capital, so that I can be able to serve customers who come and send and receive money from my shop.\r\n\r\nWhat do you love about your business?\r\nI love every aspect of running my own business, especially the fact that it has made me more sustainable. I am now able to provide for my family.

Nubia says that a girlfriend invited her to join the group because she knew she wouldn\u2019t disappoint them and that\u2019s why she invited her.\r\n\r\nShe works selling second-hand clothes and shoes at a street market in her town and outside her house.  She stocks up on clothes in other street markets where she buys them more inexpensively and then she resells them outside her house to earn a little profit.  She says she sells clothes for women, men and children.  She relates that she started the business because she didn\u2019t have a stable job and started selling her own clothes that she didn\u2019t wear anymore and seeing that it sold quickly she decided she\u2019d better go into selling second-hand clothes full-time.\r\n\r\nAt present she\u2019s asking for a loan to stock up because the months of May and June are of high demand due to Mother\u2019s Day and the end of the school year.  She puts a lot of effort into her work because she wants her daughter to have a better quality of life and want for nothing.  Nubia\u2019s dream is to build a locale at home where her business is better established so that she can be protected from weather inclemency and her clothes and shoes that she sells won\u2019t be damaged.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are called Cristina, Rosa, Mariana, Jorge, Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, Adriana, Teresa, Jaime and Norma.  They will invest in their businesses: to buy shoes and clothes by catalog, to buy supplies to make artisanal clothing, to buy bread baking ingredients, to buy supplies to make crafts to sell, to buy ingredients and corn on the cob to then sell cooked and to buy clothes for women and men to resell.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7275,"image":{"id":1359764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

atr\u00e1s una amiga la invito a formar parte de un grupo llamado Quetzal, los cuales piden cr\u00e9ditos para mejorar sus negocios. Conchita, como de cari\u00f1o le dicen, se dedica desde hace 3 a\u00f1os a la elaboraci\u00f3n de tortillas hechas a mano ya que no ten\u00eda trabajo estable porque ella no tiene estudios y se le hace dif\u00edcil conseguir un trabajo porque no sabe leer ni escribir, ella no fue a la escuela porque a sus pap\u00e1s no les alcazaba para los gastos de sus \u00fatiles escolares. Es por eso que Concepci\u00f3n decidi\u00f3 poner su propio negocio y con la ayuda de su esposo logr\u00f3 comprar un comal y poner un puesto de tortillas en su casa, las cuales hace a diario y vende por docenas, dice ella \u201clas m\u00e1s ricas y baratas del lugar\u201d, y tambi\u00e9n puso el negocio para ayudar a su esposo con los gastos de sus hijos ya que lo que \u00e9l gana como empleado no le alcanzaba. Platica que al principio s\u00ed le era dif\u00edcil conseguir clientes ya que hay mas personas que venden tortillas pero ahorita tiene ya sus propias clientes ya que ella elabora sus productos 100% de ma\u00edz y eso le gusta a las personas porque las tortillas duran un poco m\u00e1s y tienen mejor sabor. A diario, ella se levanta a muy temprana hora a poner el nixtamal y lo lleva a moler  para obtener la masa con la cual hace las tortillas, ella usa un comal de barro y le\u00f1a porque dice que as\u00ed obtienen un mejor sabor las tortillas. Platica que est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de ma\u00edz, le\u00f1a, cal y otro comal ya que nada m\u00e1s le dura 3 meses de tanto uso y es que este material tambi\u00e9n es m\u00e1s delicado. La meta de Conchita es  tener m\u00e1s clientes y hacerse de un puesto en la central de abastos de una poblaci\u00f3n cercana a la de ella para obtener m\u00e1s ganancias. Los dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo se llaman Anastasia, Gonzalo, Maribel, Ma. del Pueblito, Noheli Alejandra, Maricela, Virginia, Martha Isabel y Norma Edith, ellas invertir\u00e1n en sus negocios en la compra de insumos para elaborar antojitos mexicanos como tacos, pambazos, quesadillas, etc, para la compra de insumos para elaborar pan para vender, compra de insumos para vender en tienda de abarrotes, para dar mantenimiento a un veh\u00edculo de fletes y mudanzas, para la compra de material para la elaboraci\u00f3n de bisuter\u00eda, para la compra de material para elaborar servilletas bordadas y para la compra y venta de frutas y legumbres de temporada.","en":"Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n, 38, says that a girlfriend invited her some months ago to become part of a group called \u201cQuetzal\u201d that asks for loans to improve their businesses.  Conchita, like she\u2019s affectionately called, has worked for the last three years making hand-made tortillas since she had no job because she never went to school and it\u2019s hard for her to get a job since she doesn\u2019t know how to read or write.  She never attended school because her parents didn\u2019t have enough to pay for school supplies.  This is why Concepci\u00f3n decided to open her own business to help her husband with their children\u2019s expenses since what he earns as an employee isn\u2019t enough.   She relates that at first it was difficult to get customers because there are other people who sell tortillas but now she has her own customers because she makes tortillas 100% of corn and people like that because the tortillas last a little longer and taste better.  \r\n\r\nShe rises very early every day to start the \u2018nixtamal\u2019 [maize boiled in lime water] and then take it to be ground into dough to make tortillas.  She uses a clay griddle and firewood because she says the tortillas taste better that way.  She relates that she\u2019s asking for this loan to buy corn, firewood, lime powder and another griddle because they only last three months because of all the use they get and this material is also more delicate.  Conchita\u2019s goal is to have more customers and to get a stand in the wholesale food market in a town nearby so she can earn higher profits.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are called Anastasia, Maribel, Mar\u00eda del Pueblito, Nohel\u00ed Alejandra, Maricela, Virginia, Martha Isabel and Norma Edith.  They will invest in their businesses which are: Mexican fast-food snacks like tacos, \u2018pambazos\u2019 [bread filled with chorizo and potatoes and dipped in red chili sauce], quesadillas [flour tortilla filled with cheese and other ingredients], and others, grocery store, moving and storage vehicle repair, costume jewelry making, materials and supplies to make embroidered napkins and seasonal fruit and vegetable sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7600,"image":{"id":1351519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is 30 years old, married and responsible for 2 children, the older of whom is in kindergarten. She completed her primary education as she was able to study thanks to her parents' efforts. She is a housewife part-time and she works part-time in agriculture, supporting her husband with the various activities that are done to cultivate coffee. The land that she works on together with her husband was acquired thanks to a family inheritance, and their other piece of land was acquired with great care and sacrifice over a long period of hard work, even though it's located 20 minutes from their home.

To provide the primary source of income for her family, Elmira is involved in animal husbandry, having started this business 16 years ago with a purchase of livestock for 9,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Elmira's persistent work, today her business yields about 5,000 - 7,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Elmira requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the micro-finance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to increase livestock headcount by buying small livestock.

","en":"Mavzuna is a young and happy woman, who is 34 years old.  She is married and has three beautiful children.  Mavzuna and her family live in a village far away from a city.  This is a little bit difficult for her children because they attend a city school, located fairly far from the village.  But Mavzuna and her husband do everything possible to make sure that their children are not in need and develop just like other children, and attend a good school.  They have to work a lot for this in order to satisfy all needs and desires of their family.  This is why they are involved in their own business.  Mavzuna buys food products in the city and brings them to her village for sale.  She owns a small store, where she can sell the products.  Also, her husband brings in an additional income home.  He is involved in farming.  He works in the field every day.  Mavzuna also has a younger brother.  He lives with his parents, who are retired.  He wants to get married next year, but now needs to earn money for this event.

He lives in a small village of Terjola District with his parents. His parents are provided with a retirement pension. Aleksi requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. Besides, they have a vineyard, with 500 grapevines. They sell the harvested products and cheese at local markets. Alongside the agricultural activities, Aleksi serves local people as a taxi driver with his car. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAleksi requested a loan from Credo to start-up family business. Aleksi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Aleksi will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built, he will be able to sow the seeds of vegetables and sell the harvested vegetables at a good price. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He lives in his own home with his parents and siblings. Angel works transporting passengers in his mototaxi. He is aware that when passengers board his vehicle, they put their lives and their safety in his hands in order to arrive safe and sound to their destination. He owns three mototaxis: he drives one and rents the other two. He has been working this job for two years and in all this time he has gained a lot of experience. He has learned that customers always want safety, speed, good service, and fair prices. Things are going very well for his business. He has a lot of regular customers who hire him for full hours sometimes for him to transport them, which earns him higher profit. \r\n\r\nHe is now preparing to increase his work and purchase another vehicle to rent and earn additional income.

He owns a welding shop, which is the only source of income for his family. His monthly income is inadequate to meet the household needs. Presently, he needs to purchase iron rods, welding rods, and soldering rods for manufacturing iron doors and windows. However, due to the lack of income, he finds it difficult. Therefore, Musarat as a member of a two-person group has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase the needed items for her husband's business. She hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband. She wants to provide a quality education to her children.

Los insumos que necesita para sus actividades productivas y para el hogar las adquiere en una ciudad que esta a 25 kil\u00f3metros de su casa; por existir escasez en el transporte debe esperar por horas para que pase el autob\u00fas. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar 5 bolsas de semilla, 20 quintales de abono, fertilizantes, herbicidas y pesticidas. Con la inversi\u00f3n, comprar todos los insumos de una sola vez, ahorr\u00e1ndose tanto viaje y m\u00e1s con la dificultad del trasporte en el lugar en donde vive. Su prop\u00f3sito, es continuar trabajando y que sus hijos estudien para que sean unos profesionales. \n\n","en":"Angela is 41 years old, she has a partner and five children. She has been working in agriculture since she was a child; it was her father who taught her and her brothers to work hard to bring money home. Today, in addition to working in agriculture with her life partner, she also makes and sells pupusas at a school. She gets household and production supplies in a city about 25 kilometers from her home; due to the transportation shortage, she has to wait for hours for a bus to come by.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundacion Campo is to buy 5 bags of seed, 20 quintals (1 quintal = 100 pounds) of manure, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. With this investment, she can buy all the supplies at once, saving herself a lot of travel, especially with the difficulty of transportation where she lives.

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his wife and children in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He is a Fuzuli refugee.  \r\n\r\nFor past ten years, he has been raising sheep because mutton is in high demand in this region. Kazim is a retired person with an income of 100 AZN monthly from this business. This is a very profitable business and Kazim is doing it together with his wife.\r\n\r\nHe is keeping a flock of sheep in his own yard. He fattens them and takes their meat to the central bazaar, where butchers and customers purchase from him.

She began her business because she needs to generate income to take care of herself and her family. She works at the business every day, from morning to night.  She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation.\r\n\r\nAgness requires a loan in order to purchase palm oil, gari and general stock.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family owns a commercial space, which is rented out so they can get a small monthly income. Mamed\u2019s wife is a teacher and gives private lessons. The family income is so small that it\u2019s rarely enough for food for them. \r\n\r\nMamed requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Mamed has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Mamed will open a beauty salon.

A los 24 a\u00f1os de edad se caso y su esposo la apoyo mucho, instalo una peque\u00f1a tienda de productos b\u00e1sicos en su casa, en donde vende aceite, huevos, frijoles, az\u00facar, jab\u00f3n, entre otros m\u00e1s y su esposo se dedicaba a elaborar medicina natural; pero lastimosamente su esposo falleci\u00f3 hace tres a\u00f1os y medio; ella quedo solo con una hija adoptada de 13 a\u00f1os de edad.\n\nHoy en d\u00eda compra cerdos y luego los vende vivos o los destaza para vender la carne en la comunidad y le va muy bien ya que no hay muchas tiendas ni destazos. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar dos cerdos, dos quintales de arroz, dos quintales de fr\u00edjoles, dos quintales de az\u00facar, detergentes, aceite, galletas, pan, caf\u00e9, entre otros productos para la tienda. Y detergentes para limpieza del hogar, pastas dentales que serian productos nuevos para la tienda.  Con la inversi\u00f3n agregara productos nuevos y aumentara la cantidad disponible, debido a que en la comunidad solo hay dos tiendas y la poblaci\u00f3n es bastante grande. Su prop\u00f3sito, es a corto plazo surtir m\u00e1s la tienda, comprar unas vitrinas y brindar lo necesario a su hija adoptiva ya que asiste al sexto grado en la escuela. \n","en":"Mar\u00eda, 50, is a widow; she comes from a very humble family so she was never able to attend school because her parents and three brothers had to work, the land to grow basic grains like corn, beans and sorghum.  Her mother taught her how to weave reed mats.  At that time she was able to do two per week; she also helped her father and brothers with the agriculture on the hillsides because the terrain is quite fractured.  \r\n\r\nAt the age of 24 she got married and her husband helped her much.  He installed a small grocery store at home where she sells oil, eggs, beans, sugar and soap among others and her husband worked making herbal remedies.  Sadly, he died three-and-a-half years ago and she was left alone with an adopted 13-year-old daughter.  At present, she buys pigs to then resell either alive or she butchers them to sell the meat in her community.  She does very well because there aren\u2019t many stores or butcher shops.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy two pigs, two quintals of rice, two quintals of beans, two quintals of sugar, detergent, oil, cookies, bread and coffee among other products for the store; also detergents for home cleaning and toothpaste which will be new products for the store.  \r\n\r\nWith this investment she will add new products and increase the amount available because there are only two stores in the community and the population is quite large.  Her short-term goal is to stock the store more, to buy some display cases and to provide what\u2019s necessary for her adopted daughter who is in sixth grade in school.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1361005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy two pigs and stock merchandise for her store.

His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family's poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. They own a plot of land where eggplant, tomatoes and greens are grown. They also have a milk cow and 4 calves. The cows are milked every day to produce dairy products. All the products are sold at the local markets and among the villagers.\r\n\r\nAlekbar requested loan from Credo to start a family business. Alekbar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Alekbar will purchase stocks of groceries and open a grocery shop. He has a commercial space in a populous area, which will help his business to be successful. Family work in the shop themselves in order to decrease the expenses and increase the income. Alekbar is a very hard working man and he will work hard and long hours to make the business profitable in order to improve the family's living conditions.

He is requesting a Kiva loan so that he can improve the business by adding more working capital. He explains that the business of money transfers is highly dependent on how much cash and electronic funds one has in the business, and currently he does not have enough money. The lack of money in his business makes him lose out on business as he cannot serve some of his customers, especially the ones that want to transfer large amounts of money.\r\n\r\nFrom the time Josen started, he has employed one person to help him with the day-to-day transactions at his shop. He is hopeful that, once he gets the Kiva loan, his business will improve and he will make more profit.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires. Also, methane from the dung can be captured in methane storage tanks.  \r\n\r\nThe purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, near the border of Tanzania. While beekeeping has not historically been a major activity in the region, the mangrove swamps closer to the coast and large passion fruit farms inland provide bees with robust sources of nectar. Though most farmers in the area are new to beekeeping, many are very enthusiastic about keeping bees. \r\n\r\nMwanaidi has three children. She has been farming for nine years and is currently growing mangoes.

After her last loan, which she invested in her business, she realized the need to improve her home.\r\n\r\nLeonidas is a single woman, and she runs a beauty salon.

This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nLeonidas thanks God, Esperanza International and all of you for this opportunity.

More than five years ago, Tigran's parents moved to the Russian Federation for work abroad. \r\n\r\nTigran is 24 years old. He graduated from State Armenian Engineering University but has never worked in that field. After serving in the military, Tigran had the chance to join to his parents in Russia, but as a very patriotic young person, he preferred to stay in his motherland and start his own business in his lovely city, Kapan. Last year Tigran rented a place in Kapan to run an internet and computer service business. His parents initially helped him buy some computers and furniture for his internet caf\u00e9. Now Tigran is very happy and appreciated by his business. Not every person has internet in his or her house in Kapan city, so Tigran has gathered a large number of customers in a short period of time. His main clients are students from Kapan. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan for Tigran with a financial company and he preferred to work with Nor Horizon and Kiva. He decided to expand the services in his internet caf\u00e9 and asks from Kiva a loan of 2,900 USD to buy a new computer, new desks and a printer for his internet caf\u00e9. \r\n\r\nTigran hopes for Kiva lenders' support in his newly created business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1361016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

Her latest loan was invested in the business, in which she sells cosmetics and beauty products. \r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business, and who have shown faithfulness in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their businesses and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nAdargisa wants to start building her house with this loan. Her house was built out of deteriorated wood, and she will rebuild it with concrete blocks. Adargisa is requesting this loan to buy cement, concrete blocks, and other building materials. She wishes to have a safe and nice home, as well as to have an improved business. \r\n\r\nRoselia, the other member in this loan will also start building her house with a concrete block structure. She will buy the same building materials but in larger quantities. \r\n\r\nAdargisa and Roselia thank God, Esperanza Internacional, and all of you for this opportunity.

","en":"Luz, 24, trades in handcrafted items and sells paintings at her home in the south of the city, where she lives with her partner and two daughters aged 3 and 7 months. Luz has two years of experience in her business, which she learnt from her parents. She has been working in this field for several years and has involved her partner who covers the different areas of the Atlantico region of Bolivar. She makes her sales on credit from Monday to Saturday 8am - 6pm, when she goes from town to town after buying products in the city centre. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her portfolio and raise her sales so that one day she can have her own home as a result of her hard work and savings. She is currently applying for a Kiva Loan, which she will use to buy lamps, paintings, ornaments, clocks and other articles that her customers have ordered and that she sees displayed on the market, which makes this an exciting investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1361041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Her investment will be successful as it is based on her ability to interpret the market over the last 10 years, during which she has worked 12 hours a day with the aim of generating income for the improved well being of her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1361044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes for children, ladies and gentlemen.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laudid Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":850000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71824},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78128},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79951},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81816},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83725},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85679},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87678},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89724},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91817},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99658}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.14,"local_amount":71824,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":75443.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968298},{"amount":43.66,"local_amount":78128,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":82065.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817478},{"amount":44.68,"local_amount":79951,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":83980.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323753},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":81816,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-22T09:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":85939.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082981},{"amount":46.78,"local_amount":83725,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":87944.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062341},{"amount":47.88,"local_amount":85679,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":89997.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732035},{"amount":49,"local_amount":87678,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":92097.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415262},{"amount":50.14,"local_amount":89724,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":94246.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104411},{"amount":51.31,"local_amount":91817,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-23T08:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96444.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919327},{"amount":55.69,"local_amount":99658,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":104680.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140133}],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T09:14:45Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:27:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Godwin","image":null}},{"id":566071,"name":"Saryat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saryat is a 29-year-old woman.

Both of her children are studying in government schools. \r\n\r\nAfshan is an efficient beautician, by profession. Since 2004, she has been operating her own beauty salon. Currently, the beauty stock of the salon is almost finished, therefore Afshan wants to purchase cosmetic products to continue her business. \r\n\r\nFor that purpose, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase beauty products, like facial creams, lipsticks, scrubs, makeup kits, hair colors, and some other varieties of products. She would also buy some new chairs for her salon. \r\n\r\nWith the profit amount, she will pay the installments of the loan and school fees for her children. She dreams to live a happy, healthy, and peaceful life with her family. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their support.

She is using her tailoring skills to generate an alternative source of income for her family. She is very experienced in stitching clothes and dresses. She has been doing this work for twenty years. Her clients are very happy and well satisfied with her work. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BRAC Pakistan, to expand her business. She wants to open a tailoring centre in her house. She would purchase two new sewing machines so that her production would be increased. She would also purchase some thread and cloth for stitching purposes. \r\n\r\nNoorjana would pay her installments with the profit amount and also pay some household expenses.

She has two children who attend different grades of elementary school. She lives with them and her husband in a solid, very well-established household. She has completed elementary school, which she was able to do through a great deal of effort and sacrifice thanks to the support provided by her parents. For many generations her entire family has worked in farming, specifically growing coffee. Her generation is no exception, since the area where she lives is very suitable for sowing and growing coffee because of its soil and its pleasant weather.

She is 38 years old, married, and has three children.  To make a living, Mary Jean owns and operates a general store.

Her children are studying in government schools. \r\n\r\nNoreen is an efficient beautician by profession. Since 1998, she has been operating her own beauty salon. Currently, the beauty stock of the salon is almost finished; therefore, Noreen wants to purchase cosmetic products to continue her business. For that, as a member of 3-person lending group, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase beauty products like facial creams, lipsticks, scrubs, makeup kits, hair colors and some other variety of products. She would also buy some new chairs for her salon. \r\n\r\nWith the profit amount, she will pay the installments of the loan and school fees for her children. She dreams to live a happy, healthy and peaceful life with her family. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their support. \r\n\r\nNote: In the picture, Noreen is raising her

She lives in the company of three of her children and two grandchildren; they live comfortably together in the house she owns. \r\n\r\nThe work that Emerita does is buying and selling various household articles like brooms, trays, baskets, disinfectants, and other articles like children's bicycles, cribs, and strollers. The products that her customers like best are those that are used in the kitchen, like pots, utensils, pans, buckets, and others. She has set up her business in a rented space where she has worked alone for one year. Her shop hours are from eight o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock at night. Occasionally, she earns money by selling meals. What she likes about this business is that it generates good profits since it is the only business specializing in this sector and there are no other similar shops. She feels happy because thanks to her work, she gets a sense of fulfillment. She really wants to continue working and being able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAt this time, Emerita is requesting 1,500 nuevos soles [PEN].

Marina requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two pigs and walnut trees. They sell the harvested walnuts locally at a good price but it is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarina requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Marina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this credit, Marina will purchase two milking cows. After purchasing milking cows, she will be able to produce dairy products to sell. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She is an enterprising woman with many dreams to fulfill. She lives in the area of Rawalpindi, Pakistan. She has been in the business of cloth selling for almost 7 years. She purchases cloth from different areas and sells in the main market for profit.\r\n\r\nShehnaz is the responsible mother of three children. Her husband makes his living as a daily worker whose income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family members. She faced many problems in her early married life - there were often days when her children slept without having any food. But now her contribution to the family income is playing a vital role in fulfilling the needs of the family.\r\n\r\nTo cope with increasing demand during the summer season, Shehnaz has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a variety of cloth in different colors. She is a member of a two-person group. She hopes to get an increase in her net income and wishes to spend part of her profits on the improvement of her house. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nNOTE: In the picture, Shehnaz is raising her

For that purpose Razia has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. She is hopeful that the loan will be productive for her business. With the profit, she wants to construct her own house.

","en":"Sandra, 51, is a fruit and vegetable merchant who also sells meat.  She started her business in 2000 with the help of her brother who encouraged her to work independently so she could improve her economic situation.  Every day she works from 4:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. selling guayaba, mango, pineapple and carrots, as well as pork, chicken and beef.  She sells from a stall directly to customers on both a cash and credit basis.  She goes to Barranquilla and the city of Monter\u00eda to buy her goods.  Her main customers are neighbors who live near the stores and passersby.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a CrediKiva loan, her first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to buy large volumes of fruit and vegetables.

Amazon\u00eda ecuatoriana, en donde las oportunidades de estudiar eran escasas, por lo que apenas termin\u00f3 la escuela primaria, adquiriendo los conocimientos b\u00e1sicos que lo ayudar\u00edan a lo largo de su vida de comerciante. Actualmente vive en Pastaza, un cant\u00f3n ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta peque\u00f1a ciudad. En cada negocio se encuentra personas que no se han dado por vencidas frente a la falta de empleo sino que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio para llevar una vida digna y hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os.\nMarco es un hombre emprendedor siempre se ha desempe\u00f1ado muy bien en el campo comercial, hace 5 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 invertir en la compra de un juego inflable a motor que entretiene a los ni\u00f1os y lo alquila por tiempos determinados  en las plazas y parques donde se ubica con la esperanza de conseguir el sustento diario. Invierte 10 horas cada d\u00eda en la preparaci\u00f3n, limpieza, mantenimiento y recorrido de parques infantiles en donde encuentra demanda del juego. Esta actividad se la ense\u00f1\u00f3 un cu\u00f1ado quien lo gui\u00f3 para la compra y administraci\u00f3n del negocio. \nMarco ha estudiado la posibilidad de ofrecer otros productos mientras transcurren los periodos en los cuales los ni\u00f1os est\u00e1n jugando, entre estos productos ha visto la factibilidad de vender dulces, manzanas, caramelos, chicles, chocolates, etc., con lo cual sus ingresos aumentar\u00e1n y de este modo \u00e9l podr\u00e1 mejorar su calidad. Para poder hacer realidad este paso de emprendimiento, Marco solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 exclusivamente en su negocio, mantenimiento y ampliaci\u00f3n, por lo cual motiva a todas aquellas personas alrededor del mundo que quieran ser parte de este sue\u00f1o a aportar con su emprendimiento y agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes en busca de mejorar la calidad de vida de sus clientes, han abierto las puertas a la microempresa para desarrollarse y crecer. ","en":"Marco is 25 years old and was born in the Amazon rain forest in Ecuador.  Here, there are very few opportunities to study and Marco barely finished primary school, though there he did learn the basic skills that help him in his life as a businessman.  Marco currently lives in Pastaza, one of the cantons of the Pastaza province.  This is part of the Amazon Region in the Republic of Ecuador.  The capital of the canton is the city of Puyo, which is in the middle of the Amazon rain forest, in the west of the Pastaza province and at 924 metres above sea level.  The area is not hugely populated but there are a number of sites that are enjoyed by both domestic and international tourists, particularly in ecological and extreme sports tourism.  This is a city whose economy is growing every day in various business sectors, including cattle raising, agriculture and tourism.  Financial and commercial businesses have set up branch offices here in order to take advantage of the lively economy that the city has.  In every business, you can find people who do not give up even in face of a lack of jobs.  Instead of giving up, people create their own businesses in order to have a decent life and make their dreams a reality.\r\nMarco is enterprising and has always worked well in business.  Five years ago he decided to invest in a children\u2019s bouncy castle and he rents it out for specific time periods in the main squares and parks.  He sets-up there hoping to earn a living.  Marco spends ten hours each day preparing, cleaning, maintaining and travelling to and from children\u2019s parks where there is demand for the bouncy castle.  Marco was taught how to set up and run this business by one of his brothers-in-law.\r\nMarco has looked at the possibility of offering other products to sell while children are playing.  Among these products he has found he could sell sweets, apples, chewing gum, chocolates and such like.  By doing this his income would increase and he would be able to improve his quality of life.  In order to turn this idea into a reality, Marco is applying for a loan to invest exclusively in his business \u2013 to look after and expand it.  So, he encourages all those around the world who would like to be a part of his dream to participate and he thanks \u201cFundaci\u00f3n Alternativa\u201d who are working to improve their borrowers quality of life.  They have opened doors for microfinance projects to develop and grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1361094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":["Rural
