Only four are currently attending school. The last grade Fatu finished before getting into business was Grade 2. For the past six years, she has been selling charcoal in the local market. She started this business with money given to her by her mother. She enjoys her business because it gives her more money. She sells six days a week from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Most of the time, she uses a bus or pickup to get her goods to her shop. She is requesting a loan to purchase more inventory for her business. Her plans are to build a house and educate her

for many years. She offers a variety of grocery items at reasonable prices and has retained many customers who regularly shop at her store.

Good roads, access to clean water, affordable rents and plentiful transportation options make Paynesville South one of the most popular places to live. Janneh is single with two children, 8 months and 6 years old. One is currently attending school, and they both live with her in her home. She runs a business selling items such as rice, oil, salt and coal from a market table. She describes herself as a serious businesswoman. She started her business one year ago, using money given to her by her mother. Typically, she works at her business from 7 AM to 6 PM, from Monday to Saturday. She transports her goods to her business by bus. She cites her greatest challenge as a shortage of capital. She is proud of her business, because it supports her household. Using the proceeds of this loan, she intends to buy more inventory. In the future, she plans to build her house and educate her children. She sincerely thanks you in advance for your support.

Good roads, access to clean water, affordable rents and plentiful transportation options make Paynesville South one of the most popular places to live. Fatu is married and has six children, between the ages of 1 and 18. Five of her children are attending school, and they all live with her in her home. She runs a business selling items such as rice, oil, pepper, Vita juice and onions from a market table. She describes herself as a serious businesswoman. She started her business two years ago, using money given to her by her husband. Typically, she works at her business from 7 AM to 4 PM, Monday to Saturday. She transports her goods to her business by bus. She cites her greatest challenge as a shortage of capital. She is proud of her business because it supports her household. She intends to use the proceeds of this loan to buy more items for her business, such as rice, oil, pepper, Vita juice and onions. In the future, she plans to build her house and educate her children.

The women live for the most part in polygamous families in Sirimou, a village in Commune de Marka Coungo, in R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro (2nd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). They are collaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso with the goal of better organizing their work at the start of the rainy season. The crops grown include peanuts, millet, okra, and sesame.

desde muy joven para ayudar a sus padres, Eduardo no pudo estudiar una carrera profesional; en sus ratos libres le gusta dedicar un poco de tiempo a la lectura y en algunas ocasiones cocina unos riqu\u00edsimos Chicharrones de Cerdo para compartir con su familia y amigos.\nPor iniciativa propia, con mucho empe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n, Eduardo se dedica a la agricultura, el tiene una

He\u2019s a very humble, hardworking, enthusiastic man who focuses all his efforts into getting ahead.  Sadly, due to the lack of economic resources and the need to go to work while still very young to help his parents, Eduardo was unable to study a professional career.  In his free moments he likes to spend some time reading and sometimes cooks delicious fried pork to share with his family and friends.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative and with much effort and dedication, Eduardo works in agriculture.

When they get out of school they help their parents with the field chores growing corn, beans and rice.  She\u2019s completed the third course of secondary school but was unable to continue studying due to the lack of economic support from her parents who taught her since she was very little how to work the land.  \r\n\r\nShe and her spouse have worked the land for more than 7 years together and the land they grow on is leased so they must work harder than normal to see good results because they share their profits with the owners of the land which is located four kilometers away from their house.  Sometimes they reach it by car and sometimes they walk; they are the only ones who do this work as a family.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s asking for help today to buy fertilizer, manure and leaf fertilizer to provide maintenance and safeguard their crops because due to price fluctuations and changes in the weather it\u2019s necessary to provide maintenance in order to have good crop yields and secure grains.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to buy a piece of land they can grow on and to be able to grow for themselves so that the profits can be shared but only among themselves as a family since they

She is a single mother with two children, aged 12 and 9. They live at her parents' home. Rocio works selling cosmetic products such as face powder, lipstick, perfumes, colognes, shampoo, talcum powder, and other skin and body health care items. She has had this business for 6 years, selling her products mainly among friends and relatives. She sells the products on credit and gets the money later on. She works on her own because this way her income increases. She also works as a secretary at a public institution in the mornings and this allows her to also offer her products to her work colleagues. What she likes about her sales job is that it allows her to spend time with her family. She is doing very well and her income already exceeds her initial investment.

","en":"Musayam is a kind-spirited woman.  She is 35 years old, married and has three children.  Her husband is a migrant worker in Russia.  Her children are ages twelve, eight and five.  She has much experience in the Tajik education system.  She works at a rural school as a teacher and has had many students that now work in many different industries.  She is proud of them.  Musayam plans to make repairs to her old home.  The money that her husband sends to her is not enough for the renovation--neither is her own pay which is little.  She is asking for a loan of 2,000 somoni to buy construction materials.  She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1362130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

responsible and hard-working women. They live in the same community and have known each other for a long time. Because they have the common goal of seeking a better future for themselves, their families and their community, the women are focused and very connected with each other.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all Friendship Bridge Trust Banks, the group has a Board of Directors. Silvia is the President of the group. She is 46 years-old and has eight children. Three years ago, Sylvia started a small business which is a convenience store. It was located in the small room of her home. Soon, she realized that she had to increase her store inventory and it was at that point that she requested a small loan from Friendship Bridge. She happily informed us that the business is doing quite well!\r\n\r\nSilvia has requested a new loan (which would be her third loan cycle) of $410 in order to purchase a refrigerator. Her clients have requested cold products such as dairy products (yogurt, cheese, cream) and she plans on making ice cream! She will also sell meat. Sylvia has had no difficulty in making her payments on previous loans. She has a well-thought out business plan and has learned a great deal about business administration as it is one of the educational themes covered in the monthly meetings of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank. A few of the other themes include self-esteem, health, diet and women\u2019s issues.\r\n\r\nSylvia and her fellow Trust Bank members appreciate having access to small loans and education. They gain confidence in themselves, realize that they have a voice, and weave new relationships. They express their gratitude to Kiva investors for believing in their ability to move forward with confidence and education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":1361730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a refrigerator.

Mongolia. The family resides in an apartment. \r\n\r\nFrom 1983 to 1990, he worked as a serviceman at a private business entity. In 1990, he began rendering passenger transportation service to local people, usually traveling between Ulaanbaatar and Darkhan. His wife has been working as a laboratory technician since 1988 and is considered by her superiors as the best staff. \r\n\r\nThe apartment they live in has been deteriorating over they years without any renovation and in 2010, he purchased it and made shallow repairs.

His retail grocery store offers the community fresh and high-quality items at a low everyday price.  At his grocery, you can find just about anything, whether you are in the mood for a quick snack or preparing a meal for your family.  \r\n\r\nHerbert came across Accion Texas Inc. while at the Small Business Development Center in Louisiana.  He was referred to Accion and approved to receive a loan, which allowed him to continue to pay his four full-time and two part-time employees, maintain a cash reserve for emergencies, purchase food for stock, and pay for the delivery services of the items.  \r\n\r\nHerbert thanks his church for spreading the good word about his business and his friends from the community for promoting his store daily by word of mouth.  Herbert creates flyers to post around the community to help with advertising, too.  These many tactics, along with his Accion loan, have given the store a boost. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Herbert plans to hire one additional full and part-time employee to assist with the business and continue to be the best local grocer in his community.  \u201cHaving money available for emergencies and staff without sacrificing is a big help,\u201d said Herbert.   \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1361626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to continue to pay his four full-time and two part-time employees, maintain a cash reserve for emergencies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Boyce, Louisiana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":566338,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Please meet 45-year-old Victoria from Paynesville North in Liberia.

He lost his family, home, car and job and was left wandering the streets of San Antonio, homeless, with only a backpack of clothes to his name.  \r\n\r\nBefore changing his life around, his daily routine consisted of doing drugs, going to work without drugs, and then returning home to do more drugs.  \r\n\r\nNow 59, Michael is at last sober.  And he owns a business.  And he\u2019s even creating jobs for others.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s God\u2019s will. I\u2019m lucky to be alive,\u201d he proclaims.\r\n\r\nHe started his business, MKH Construction, in June 2012.  Within two months he had contracted 10 projects simply by word of mouth.  And the business has continued to grow.  He repairs homes to make them presentable for leasing. As Michael tells it, some tenants are not gentle on their properties, so landlords contract with him to fix, repair, or replace balconies, air and light fixtures and flooring.\r\n\r\nMichael normally works on homes in Cibolo, Schertz and Converse, Texas. His business employs four to five residents of Haven for Hope, a transitional living campus for the homeless in San Antonio \u2013 where he also spent time getting his life back together.\r\n\r\nMichael has been in the construction industry since he was 17 when he took his first roofing job in California. From there, he worked for a general contractor, who only hired workers who knew how to do everything to fix a house.  While living at Haven for Hope, Michael contemplated working for the national do-it-yourself chain Home Depot--until he attended a day class on construction. \u201cI was bored and had nothing to do, so I volunteered to work with the instructor, and he saw I knew a little more than him,\u201d Michael said.\r\n\r\nThat instructor introduced Michael to Accion Texas, Inc., allowing him to become the first Haven for Hope resident to receive a loan.  Michael returned to Accion nine months later to purchase equipment. \u201cI\u2019m running an honest job. What\u2019s different about me is that I buy all materials and I don\u2019t collect until the project is complete,\u201d he says proudly.  \u201cThe loan enabled me to buy tools that will help me do an even better job for my clients.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5325,"image":{"id":1361886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional 'ger' (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. She has been working as a miner at a mining company for two years. He husband has the position of marketing manager at a restaurant.\r\n\r\n Even though they have a house on their land, they live in a Mongolian traditional ger since the house has vulnerable windows, walls and roofs. But recently they decided to move into their house because as winter comes, the ger couldn't afford comfortable and warm accommodation due to its long-time usage. So Mrs. Tuvshinmandakh is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, planks, vacuum-insulated windows, hardwood floors, shingles, fiberglass, cotton and gypsum.\r\n\r\n Using those materials, she and her husband will repair and insulate their house. As a result, they can live in a comfortable and warm place no fear of harsh wintertime. More importantly, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

It is also nice to make my own decisions.\"\n\nWhat challenges do you face in your business?\n\"The biggest challenge that I face in my business is that I do not have enough money to order a lot of stock, and as a result I end up disappointing my customers.

Together they are a family alongside their four children.  Thanks to various years working with her husband, Catalina now has a home built of bricks and cement.  Catalina has now been working in the fields for seventeen years, growing organic cacao.  She has a plot of land that she inherited from her grandparents when she was young and it has helped her to earn an income to support her family.  In order to obtain a good quality product, Catalina uses organic fertiliser that she buys from one of the area's biggest distributors.  Catalina is dedicated to her work and so is different from other producers in the area.  She only takes on labourers from the area for harvest.  After the harvest she dries the fruit and sells it to buyers in area, the price varying according to the quality of the product.  This sale allows her to earn back the money she has invested.  Catalina's main goal is to work with motivation so as to provide financial support to her younger children and send them to study in the city.  This is Catalina's third loan from Kiva and she is grateful for the opportunity she is receiving that will help her to prosper.  Catalina is applying for a loan of 1000 Nuevo Soles to buy organic fertiliser and to improve the quality of her plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1361773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":103.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":103.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":112.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":116.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.36,"local_amount":75.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:03Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975746},{"amount":34.25,"local_amount":91.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":91.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997014},{"amount":35.37,"local_amount":94.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":94.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864484},{"amount":34.22,"local_amount":91.24,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":91.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352852},{"amount":37.66,"local_amount":100.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904622},{"amount":38.91,"local_amount":103.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090639},{"amount":38.79,"local_amount":103.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":103.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777343},{"amount":41.46,"local_amount":110.57,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":111.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450597884},{"amount":42.11,"local_amount":112.28,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-14T09:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":112.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147255},{"amount":43.87,"local_amount":116.99,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-09T09:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":117.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240489}],"funded_date":"2013-05-29T22:41:45Z","paid_date":"2014-09-09T09:56:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":566238,"name":"San Francisco Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado San Francisco est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 11 del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, donde todas trabajan y se ayudan por salir adelante.

Her parents gave her a house made of wood. Daysi works in the field growing regional crops such as organic cacao, coffee, and mullein. She grew up watching her parents do the same work, which prompted her years later to follow the family tradition on her own. On becoming engaged to Danny, she found a great work partner, with whom she goes to the fields every day to do various chores in hopes of obtaining quality crops at the end of the growing season. \r\n\r\nOrganic cacao is a very profitable local crop, but it requires continuous labor to care and maintain it. She regularly hires local workers to pull weeds between the plants to keep them healthy. Daysi's main goal is to build a house with bricks and cement. This is her second loan cycle with Kiva, and she is grateful for the chance to get ahead.

She is a very kind, hard-working and enthusiastic person who gives her all to get her family ahead; she is both father and mother to her children. Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources and due to the need to start work at a very young age, Janeth was not able to study accounting. In her free time she enjoys playing with her children. Sometimes, she cooks a delicious arroz con pato [rice and duck] for her family.\r\nOn her own initiative, with great hard work and dedication, Janeth operates her business selling candy wholesale and retail.

In his free time, he enjoys playing soccer with his friends and he also sometimes cooks a delicious 'arroz verde' to share with his family.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, working with a great deal of determination and commitment, Waldir is employed as a farm laborer in his city.  He performs irrigation work and harvest crops, among other tasks.  He works for approximately 10 hours every day and believes that things are going well because of the effort he puts in and the friendly way he treats others.\r\n\r\nWaldir is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to buy a sewing machine which he will give to his mother to help her.  His mother makes clothing and her current machine is in a bad state of repair.  Waldir will continue working hard to realize his big dream of studying for a degree."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1361796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a sewing machine for his mother","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Waldir Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55.11},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":57.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":65.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.96,"local_amount":55.11,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":61.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664554},{"amount":24.06,"local_amount":57.74,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":64.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776145},{"amount":24.93,"local_amount":59.82,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":66.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779264},{"amount":25.96,"local_amount":62.32,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054447},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":65.01,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":72.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819353}],"funded_date":"2013-05-29T23:34:10Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T12:54:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":566487,"name":"Qadir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Qadir is 25 years old, married, and lives with his wife in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement.

She is a single mother of three children and has a wooden home thanks to her own hard work. Donatilda cultivates organic cocoa. When she started this work she counted on her husband's support. Through her divorce, she has hired local labourers to do the maintenance.\r\nWith the passing of time, and thanks to her work in the fields, she has been able to get her children ahead while expanding her land. She has bought more land and expanded her cocoa plantations with the goal of improving her income. \r\nShe has noted that several of her cocoa plants are getting old and are not producing anymore; it is necessary to change them so that she will have more money in the next harvest. In order to improve the quality of her produce, she only uses organic fertilizer because she feels that chemical fertilizers harm the soil long-term. This is her third loan with Kiva, and she is very grateful.

She is a widow, and has several children.  She lives with her family in a house that she has that is made of adobe.  She has some land that she bought when she was very young with the help of her deceased husband, so that they could work the land and support their children.  Once she was left a widow, she saw the need to work independently, often making use of the help of workers in the area.  On her land, she cultivates a variety of products that she considers to be profitable, such as: organic cocoa, coffee, and other products.  Over the years, and thanks to her work, she managed to buy other land where she decided to plant more cocoa trees, because compared to other products they are easier to care for.  With the sales of the dried beans to the buyers in the area, it is possible to recover the money invested and also earn good profits.  \r\n\r\nIn order to carry out her work well, she needs money so that she can maintain her lands with activities such as weed removal with the help of workers from the area, and with products such as organic fertilizers.

Ana vive con su pareja e hijo en Pastaza, un cant\u00f3n ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos.

","en":"Ana is a twenty-one-year-old woman.  When she completed secondary school, she began working to support her household.  She decided to move in with her partner Edgar, who is twenty-four and has worked as a bricklayer from a very early age.  Together they have a son, and they dream that one day he will have a professional career.  For this reason they work hard so that their son will have everything he needs.\r\n\r\nThey live in Pastaza, a canton in the province if the same name, in the Amazonian region of Ecuador.  The seat of the canton is the city of Puyo, which is located in the middle of the Amazonian forest in the west of the province, at an altitude of 924 meters above sea level.  The area is not heavily populated, but there are a great number of sites that are popular with domestic and international tourists, especially having to do with ecological activity and extreme sports.  The city is growing economically every day from commercial activity, livestock, agriculture and tourism.  Financial and commercial firms have opened branches here in order to take advantage of the economic activity of this small city.\r\n\r\nThere are many people here who have not given up due to lack of employment opportunities, but who instead have started their own businesses in order to live a dignified life and make their dreams a reality.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Ana has been selling different brands of cosmetics.  She sells her products on the long streets of her city, calling on customers, the majority of whom are women, also collecting payments and delivering her products.

Many times, her customers ask for products that they need immediately, and this is an opportunity to obtain additional income.  \r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is seeking a loan so that she can build up her inventory and obtain higher profits.

She could not go further than third grade in primary school, because her parents, who taught her at a very early age how to till the land, could not support her. She is a very experienced farmer when it comes to growing potatoes, broccolis, and cauliflower. Her sister is her only support. Mar\u00eda works from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the land. On week-ends, she sells her produce at the local market, either to direct consumers or to wholesalers who come to her area and sell the produce somewhere else. Mar\u00eda's lands are one and a half kilometres away from her home, a distance she walks on foot every day. Today, she asks for a loan to buy fertiliser, manure, foliar concentrate, and certified seeds, in order to plant potatoes. Her hopes and dreams have to do with improving her home: it wants mortar, as well as something else than bricks for a floor.

The couple have seven children and live in a wooden house that they worked hard to buy.\r\n\r\nEdilberta grows plants which are native to her region such as organic cacao, coffee, etc.  She grows them on a plot of farmland that she bought with the help of her husband when she was young so that she could financially support her children.  Edilberta has been farming with her husband for 18 years and, on more than one occasion, she has hired local workers to help finish off the farming tasks more quickly so that she can benefit from uniform growth on all her fields.  Edilberta has more cacao trees on her land than anything else because cacao is a product which is in good demand in her area and it is possible to recoup her investment with better additional profits.  Edilberta's work enables her to financially support her children so that she can send them to school and cover their other expenses.  However, she hopes over time that she will also be able to improve her home, building it from solid materials, so that she can give her family a better environment in which to live.\r\n\r\nThis is Edilberta's second loan from Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support that she is receiving as it helps her to continue in her work.

He prides himself in doing top quality work for his customers at a competitive price.  Although he still has a full-time job, Ervin is looking to increase his business\u2019s customer base so that he can be one step closer to financial independence.\n\nErvin was recently awarded a new contract with Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.  While thrilled at the new business opportunity, he was concerned about the large financial strain his business would experience during the first month of taking on the new contract.  As he explored his options to resolve this concern, Ervin came across the Accion Texas Inc. website and applied for a loan.\n\nWith the funds he receives from the loan, Ervin will be able to cover payroll expenses for his employees until he receives the first payment from his new customer.  This is an important and large contract that Ervin would not have been able to take on without a boost to his working capital.  He is hopeful that this will help propel his company to the next level as he works toward his ultimate goal of full-time business operations.\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1358033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to cover payroll expenses ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Antonio, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ervin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":565875,"name":"La Caba\u00f1ita Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandra tiene 41 a\u00f1os de edad, ella pertenece a un grupo llamado La Caba\u00f1ita y dice que una prima fue que la invito a formar parte del grupo el cual trabaja con Visi\u00f3n Fund pidiendo cr\u00e9ditos para mejorar su negocio y con las ganancias mejorar la calidad de vida de sus familias.

She\u2019s a very hardworking, cheerful woman.  \r\n\r\nAle, as she\u2019s affectionately called, sells bedspreads, shoes and clothes for women and men by catalog.  She says she started this business to help her husband with household expenses since she has four children and was unable to work outside the home because her grandmother also lives with her and she\u2019s not well and she must take care of her.  She says that\u2019s why she decided to start her own business so she could stay and care for her home.  \r\n\r\nShe gets her children ready for school in the morning and then makes breakfast for her grandmother and for her since her husband leaves for work very early in the morning.  She does her cleaning chores and then heads out to sell bedspreads house to house; sometimes her customers come to her house looking for her to order something or other.  \r\n\r\nShe says that she gets the things she sells from authorized suppliers in the city of Zit\u00e1cuaro so she can get better prices.  At the moment, she\u2019s asking for a loan to fill some pending customer orders.  She comments that this is the month when sales are highest because of Mother\u2019s Day, Teacher\u2019s Day, Student\u2019s Day and the end of the school term; people take advantage of this to give gifts and they come to her to buy shoes and clothes.  This is why she wants to be well-stocked right now.  Alejandra thanks VisionFund for the trust they\u2019ve placed in her and for giving her loans to improve her business thus helping her husband, children and grandmother.  \r\n\r\nThe other group members are named Consuelo, Florentina, Esperanza, Tomasa, Blanca Estela, Maricela, Martha, Liliana, Reynalda and Sof\u00eda.

district of Parcona. He is a friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who dedicates all of his efforts into making headway for his family. Sadly as a result of a lack of resources and the necessity to work from a very young age, Eloy was not able to pursue a civil engineering degree as he hoped. In his free time he enjoys playing soccer with his friend and on occasion cooking a rich Carapulca con Sopa Seca (a traditional dish) to share with his family. On his own initiative and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Eloy works as a security guard for a construction materials company in his city. He works every day for approximately 12 hours, and believes it is going well thanks to his good performance and the friendly way he treats others. Eloy is very grateful for Kiva lenders, because thanks to your support he will be able to make improvements to his home, since the winter rainy season is approaching and he wants to repair his roof. In this way, Eloy and his family will have more safety and comfort, so he will continue working hard with the support of his wife to achieve his biggest dream of having a good restaurant."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1361893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to make improvements to his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T05:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T05:00:01Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eloy Richard ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":112.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120.3},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121.44},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":126.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":134.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":136.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":144.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":147.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":153.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":174.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":179.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":188.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":194.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":202.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":210.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":218.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.73},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":566608,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is married and has three minor children who go to school.

By doing this, Jonathan will have another source of income, allowing him to save up, little, by little, in order to achieve his dream of owning his own house.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1361901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a secondhand car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T07:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T07:40:01Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonathan Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":199.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":211.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":215.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":224.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":235.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":242.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":253.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":261.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":271.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":285.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":293.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":304.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":566636,"name":"Rebecca's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group consists of four members, namely Charlotte, Mary, Gifty and Rebecca who reside in Teshie.

is a 49-year-old married man from Gaza city. He is a father with eight children. Sameer works as a worker with a very low wage that barely covers the family's needs.\r\n \r\nSameer would like to improve his family's living conditions by completing his new home and live in it with his family. Sameer took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN. This loan will help Sameer to buy more construction materials and complete his new home.\r\n \r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

After her last loan, which she invested in her business, she realized the need to finish building her home structure.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she talked to other members of her group and they recommended her for a housing loan to improve her home by covering the concrete blocks walls with cement, painting them and also to cover the floor with ceramics or tiles and to buy windows and doors. This loan will be used totally to buy all materials to build those areas. Justa is the mother of 4 children and she lives together with them in her unfinished house. \r\n\r\nEsperanza International runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nShe thanks God, Esperanza International and all of you for this opportunity.

Puerto Plata. This is his 11th loan, which he will use to improve his house. He has had his business of selling fruits and vegetables, started from his savings, for over thirty years, and now he is running a grocery or food store.\r\n\r\nAfter his last loan, which he invested in his business, Isidro realized the need to improve his home structure. With this housing loan he is able to take, and with his business profits, he can pay for the home improvements and save for more. The other members of his group are recommending him for a housing loan to start with the house construction. Now he will build his house roof, and build up his deteriorated wood walls with concrete blocks.\r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nIsidro lives together with his long term partner and one of his three children. He thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity. In his name and that of his family, he thanks all of you for your support!

He lives in Laredo, which borders Mexico along the Rio Grande in Texas. There are many different types of Mexican restaurants there, but there were few serving the traditional fried plantain dishes of his home country. Fortunately for Melvin J. and Laredo, his wife is an excellent cook. Together, the couple decided to open a Caribbean restaurant called Restaurant Grandes Ligas last year. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe saw an opportunity,\u201d Melvin J. said.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant is open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day of the week. Melvin J. said he works the front of the restaurant and his wife works the back as the cook. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, and offer everything from jelly-filled Cuban breads to licuados de mamay or papaya \u2013 tropical fruit smoothies -- for breakfast. In addition to serving mofongo con camaron \u2013 fried mashed plantains covered in a shrimp stew \u2013 Grandes Ligas serves tacos and other Mexican food.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople asked for the breakfast tacos, so we offer them,\u201d he said. \r\n\r\nWhen Melvin J. realized he needed some help with financing the painting and operation of his restaurant, he knew to apply with Accion Texas Inc. One and a half years ago, Melvin J. applied for and received a $500 Accion Texas loan to stock the shelves of another business he owns \u2013 a bot\u00e1nica or traditional herbs and medicines store called Yerberia San Miguel. He quickly paid Accion back and knew that doing so would help him build his credit and become eligible for a larger loan.\r\n\r\nAt his restaurant, Melvin J. said he serves a loyal clientele of people who love his wife\u2019s cooking and the cozy atmosphere dedicated to Major League Baseball.
