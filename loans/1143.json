Fascinated by the architecture of his hometown, Chicago, Sean always knew he wanted to build structures and houses. \r\n\r\nAs an adult, Sean\u2019s passion for seeing a project through and building something of value propelled him into the construction business.  Sean honed his trade working on extensive reconstruction and repair of Navy barracks.  He reflects that his time there taught him just how important your team is and how important it is for each member to work hard.\r\n\r\nIn January 2011, Sean started his own construction firm, fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming an entrepreneur.  Almost two and a half years later, Sean's business has grown and expanded, providing Sean with the opportunity to positively affect the lives of many individuals and their families.  For Sean, the best part of his job is providing quality service in home renovation that not only creates a beautiful new space, but also restores and protects the special memories of the homeowner.  \r\n\r\nA loan of $7,332.90 will enable Sean to purchase equipment necessary to expand his construction business further.  Sean will also use the loan to pursue a public works contract in San Diego to restore historic San Diego buildings.  This is a huge growth opportunity for Sean and his business. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sean hopes to grow his business to the point where he can add jobs to the community and mentor younger generations in his trade.  Currently, Sean hires three part-time contractors as needed, but with further expansion, he can hire full-time employees and achieve his dream of passing on his craft.

Using these materials, she and her husband can repair and insulate their house. The renovated house will enable the family to reduce their coal consumption, release less pollutants, thereby contributing to efforts against air pollution.

He and his wife always dreamed to have many children, but due to their health they only managed to have one, their long-awaited and beloved son. The two have dedicated their life to him and are doing everything they can to provide for him. They live modestly but happiness never leaves their house. All their neighbors appreciate this family's generous soul. Turdimurod himself is an experienced farmer and has been farming for 20 years. He has his own land where he grows grain. This is his main source of income and he makes good profits from his farm. Turdimurod also has cattle which he raises for resale. His wife helps take care of the animals and she also sells their milk. The grain harvest is the main stable income for the family so Turdimurod wants to increase his harvest and be able to earn more from it. For this reason Turdimurod has turned to Arvand for a loan which he will use to buy seeds for various grain crops. He thanks everyone in Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1358096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Turdimurod","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":326.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":335.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":344.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":354.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":364.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":374.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":384.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":395.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":406.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":418.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":429.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":441.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":467},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":480.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":493.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":507.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":521.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":566947,"name":"Othman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Othman is a 45 years old married man and he is the father of four sons.

He is accomplishing both of his dreams. He started a commercial cleaning business five years ago and managed commercial cleaning contracts part-time while working on his accounting degree at Southern University. Last year, he incorporated and renamed his business to A. Commercial Cleaning Inc. He graduates from college at the end of the year.\r\n\r\nDuran said while he initially started the business to finance college and to fit work into his school schedule, he has big plans to grow his business once he graduates.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I like what I do,\u201d Duran said. \u201cI've been doing this for five years and we've started growing a lot. We're in the process of getting an office set up. Our goal is to be operating at least 100 cleaning contracts.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently, Duran manages 15 cleaning contracts and employs two workers full-time and three part-time. He plans to hire five more part-time workers, but hopes someday to hire at least 50. He said what distinguishes his business from others is the follow-through and quality control.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat separates us from other businesses is that we are very proactive with what we do,\u201d Duran said. \u201cWe have a field manager. And the field manager does drop in on a job to make sure the cleaning is up to par. And if there is a problem, he fixes it right then and there. Our belief is that we want to catch a problem before you do.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo expand his services, Duran needed to buy a carpet cleaner and a floor buffer for his business but didn\u2019t have the capital up front. He learned about Accion Louisiana \u2013 Accion Texas\u2019s branch in Baton Rouge \u2013 from the Louisiana Small Business Development Center. \r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a great experience, working with Accion,\u201d Duran said. \u201cI will refer as many people as possible to them.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuran said he is excited about finishing his degree.

These trucks are used for fixing street lights, putting up advertising banners and for things people can\u2019t reach with a ladder.

Kenya. She has 2 children and has been doing this work for 15 years. Her primary income sources are crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Nurturing the young plants.' Her biggest challenge is 'Controlling weeds.' Animals on the farm have been given no names.\r\n\r\nSerah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Juhudi come to us its so easy to get a loan to improve our farms.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Microfinace loans are changing lives.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit her family', Serah replied 'We'll be able to harvest water for domestic use hence clean water for the family.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Serah owns the following: 'cow, poultry, pump' but does not own 'pig, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'solar power, TV, DVD' but does not have 'mosquito net, electricity, running water, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1362937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a water tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ndaragwa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Serah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4314.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4428.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4665.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4789.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4915.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5045.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5178.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5315.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5456.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5600.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5748.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.36,"local_amount":8636.53,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8865.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417320},{"amount":111.22,"local_amount":9204.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":9448.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880853},{"amount":57.83,"local_amount":4785.6,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4912.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529487},{"amount":59.35,"local_amount":4912.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5042.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753412},{"amount":127.45,"local_amount":10547.86,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10827.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343854},{"amount":125.41,"local_amount":10379.15,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10653.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479164802},{"amount":68.84,"local_amount":5696.75,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5847.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859449},{"amount":69.24,"local_amount":5730.26,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5881.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287000},{"amount":1.3,"local_amount":96.04,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":98.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054455}],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T13:32:53Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T13:36:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":566970,"name":"Mahmoud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mahmoud is a 26-year-old single man.

Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Kanji, Varentine (all cows).'\r\n\r\nShellmith was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'It's easy to borrow.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: 'They assist people to get loans with little security.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family', Shellmith replied 'It will improve my dairy farming, leading to increased milk production.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Shellmith owns the following: 'cow, poultry, pump and bicycle' but does not own 'pig, motorcycle or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, solar power, running water, TV and DVD' but does not have 'electricity or sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1362924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to construct a zero grazing unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ndaragwa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shelmith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4314.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4428.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4665.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4789.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4915.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5045.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5178.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5315.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5456.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5600.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5748.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.36,"local_amount":8636.53,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8865.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417319},{"amount":111.22,"local_amount":9204.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":9448.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880852},{"amount":57.83,"local_amount":4785.6,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4912.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529486},{"amount":59.35,"local_amount":4912.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5042.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753411},{"amount":127.16,"local_amount":10523.9,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10802.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343853},{"amount":265.08,"local_amount":21937.22,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":22518.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479164801}],"funded_date":"2013-06-01T18:28:23Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T12:13:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":566973,"name":"Suzette Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suzette Joy of San Roque, Panaon, Misamis Occidental, is a 33-year-old woman and is married with one child.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, she manages her own motor transport services to the community, earning 5,000 PHP monthly.

She has a high school education but had a child when she was still very young and had to face the great difficulties that accompany the responsibility of educating a child alone.  Her son is now an adult and lives independently which fills Rosa with pride.  Now this tenacious, entrepreneurial mother lives alone in R\u00edo Verde parish in Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province.  This city has a lot of commercial activity as it has become an important dry port where commercial exchanges are made between the mountainous and coastal regions of the country.  Its various tourist attractions, together with its warm weather, make it very popular with tourists from both at home and abroad.  Most of the locals run some kind of commercial or service-based business aimed at local people and tourists. \r\n\r\nRosa inherited her entrepreneurial spirit from her mother who taught her to run her own business, which she has kept running for the last 10 years.  It is how she has earned her living and she works at least 12 hours a day in her store as she opens thr doors when the day has barely begun to supply local housewives and students who are beginning their day before dawn, and she closes the doors when it gets dark and everybody is already home relaxing.  \r\n\r\nRosa has grown alongside her business and has seen that her customers have a lot of demands which go unfulfilled.  For this reason, she would like to increase the variety of products she offers so that she can meet the needs of all her customers.  She is requesting a loan to invest in buying food products, candies, drinks and toiletries so that she can increase her range of products and increase her sales.  This will make her more profits which will allow her to improve her quality of life and save up enough to cover any unanticipated health and food needs in the future.  Rosa is grateful to Kiva lenders who sponsor her micro-business.  She is also thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for putting their trust in her and enabling her to take this step towards growing her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1361856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise and increase the variety of products she sells","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-05-30T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-29T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660.7,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":85.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":91.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":92.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":94.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":96.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":98.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":101.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.11,"local_amount":85.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313799},{"amount":93.13,"local_amount":91.16,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":93.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565406},{"amount":94.73,"local_amount":92.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":94.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814444},{"amount":97.69,"local_amount":95.62,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":97.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320617},{"amount":99.07,"local_amount":96.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":99.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856307},{"amount":101.99,"local_amount":99.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":101.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059882},{"amount":101.28,"local_amount":99.14,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995225}],"funded_date":"2013-06-09T21:01:59Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":564836,"name":"Rosemary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemary is 59 years old.

When asked how this loan will benefit her family,  Veronica replied, \"It will provide a means of harvesting clean water for consumption.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Veronica owns the following: cow, poultry, and a pump. She does not own a pig, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. In the household, this borrower has solar power, TV, and DVD, but does not have a mosquito net, electricity, running water, or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo

llegar al quinto a\u00f1o de bachillerato cuando su mayor anhelo era terminar la secundaria, por lo que empez\u00f3 a trabajar para poder pagarse los estudios con sus propios recursos, y as\u00ed en poco tiempo poder obtener su bachillerato internacional para el cual est\u00e1 estudiando sin darse por vencida ante las adversidades, pues muchas veces se juega su propia seguridad al trasladarse al centro de la ciudad buscando un centro de c\u00f3mputo para realizar sus tareas. Adriana vive en una parroquia alejada del pueblo de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nLa hermana de Adriana es costurera titulada y le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a Adriana la actividad de arreglar y confeccionar ropa casual. Adriana realiza varios arreglos en el d\u00eda, pues dedica en la semana 2 horas para terminar trabajos pendientes y los domingos pasa 12 horas en su m\u00e1quina para dejar todos los trabajos pendientes listos. En temporada de vacaciones ella trabaja m\u00e1s d\u00edas en la semana, mejorando as\u00ed sus ingresos. Esta jovencita emprendedora y luchadora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de un computador para as\u00ed poder tener en su casa acceso a la tecnolog\u00eda para realizar sus tareas y de este modo ahorrar en trasporte, impresiones y alquiler que pagaba en los diferentes centros de c\u00f3mputo. Adem\u00e1s estar\u00e1 m\u00e1s segura en casa y el tiempo que le tomaba en transportarse, ella lo podr\u00e1 invertir en realizar m\u00e1s trabajos de costura.\nAdriana agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por creer en ella y en sus sue\u00f1os, pues si no le abr\u00edan las puertas, ella no ten\u00eda la oportunidad de conseguir financiamiento para su computador y tambi\u00e9n agradece a los inversionistas que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva le ayudar\u00e1n aun sin conocerla, esto es muy valioso para ella.","en":"Adriana is a very young woman, 18 years old. Her greatest wish is to graduate high school, and she is proud to say she has had her family's full support until now. Nevertheless, she started to work in order to pay for her studies out of her own pocket, in order to finish the last year of high school and obtain the international diploma she has studied for. She refuses to admit defeat in the face of adversity, which is why, at great personal risk, she travels to the centre of the city to do her homework on a computer in a cybercaf\u00e9. Adriana lives in a remote village called Salcedo, located in Oriente de Cotopaxi Province, one of the most important provinces in the Ecuadorian mountains. This village attracts tourists with its lagoons and other bodies of water, suited for tourists looking for a thrill and extreme sports. However, agriculture, followed by animal husbandry, are still the main economic resources of the village. Despite the presence of a functioning economy, it is a very poor village, with worrying statistics of illiteracy and poverty, because many basic necessities are unevenly distributed. For instance, only 25% of homes are connected to the sewer system. Adriana's sister is a certified seamstress, and she taught Adriana how to mend as well as how to make casual clothes. Adriana does many such mendings in a day, since she works at her sewing machine two hours a day and twelve on Sundays. During school holidays, she works a bit more during the week, in order to increase her income. This enterprising and brave young woman asks for a loan that she will use to buy a computer, so as to have access in her own home to the technology she needs to complete her school assignments. This way, she will be able to save money on transportation and on cybercaf\u00e9 and printing fees.

He is 43 years old, married and a father of a single child. Kassem works hard to provide the family income while his wife takes care of their children.\r\n\r\nKassem owns a small shop where he sells cements which are used for construction purposes. He has been in this field since 1990 and has gained good experience. Now, Kassem has 3 employees and is well-known in the surrounding area with an excellent reputation.\r\n\r\nKassem is requesting a loan of $2,000.

His plan is to sell alcohol and other drinks. In order to make this project come to fruition, he asks for a loan to fit out his locale and acquire the necessary permits and licences to open shop.

She is single and has two children, ages 5 and 3. They are currently attending school and live at home. She had completed grade twelve before starting her business. She describes herself as a hardworking woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, which is located by the sea and is the capital city of Grand Bassa County. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish. Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia. \r\n\r\nAngeline has had a table business which sells cosmetics, such as body perfume, body cream, roll-on, etc., for the past three years. She works from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. each day at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is less income. She intends to use the loan to buy more goods. \r\n\r\nShe started her business by selling for her mother. She likes her business because it helps to support her home. She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nAngeline wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for their

Most people in the city speak Bassa, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n\r\nAnnie lives with her husband and six children who are between the ages of 25 and 14. Only one of her children is in school. Annie has been selling dry and fresh fish for the past 17 years. She works from 7am to 6pm everyday.  Her greatest challenge in business is less income. She intends to use the loan to buy more fish. She started her business by selling for her mother. She likes her business because it helps to support her home. She hopes to one day to own a house. She wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advanced for their help.

She describes herself as a hardworking woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, which is located by the sea and is the capital city of Grand Bassa County. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish. Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n\r\nRose has a table business and has been selling bread, fruits, etc. for the past ten years. She works from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. each day at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is less income. \r\n\r\nRose intends to use the loan to buy more inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother. She likes her business because it helps to support her home. She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for their

In particular, they own a plot of land, where potatoes are grown. They also have five milk cows and ten calves. The family milks the cows every day to produce dairy products. The harvested potatoes and dairy products are sold to local retailers. \r\n\r\nTamaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provision of business startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Tamaz will purchase a minibus. He wants to start trading with potatoes and dairy products. Also when his calves are grown, Tamaz will be able to produce more dairy products. As retailers are buying the products at a low cost, he wants to distribute his products to the villagers and at the local markets to sell at a good price. This will help him to earn more income for the family and improve their living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1363202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To buy a minibus in order to be able to trade potatoes and dairy products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kekhovani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-31T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-30T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamaz ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":106.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":108.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":112.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":113.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":117.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":117.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":120.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":127.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":129.52},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":134.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":136.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":139.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":142.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":148.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":151.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":154.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":158.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":164.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.39},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.09},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":567149,"name":"Oretha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oretha lives in Buchanan, the capital City of Grand Bassa County, located by the sea.

Currently she studies and lives at home with her mother.  Karen's work consists of selling clothing of different brands, styles and sizes for all ages, for men as well as for women.  She has a stall in the central market of her city and thus her sales are gratifying.  All of her merchandise is renewed each month, and for that reason she travels to another city where she finds everything necessary at lower prices.  She has been working in this field for 10 years, since from that time she has been helping her mother to do the same work.  What she likes most about her work is the ease with which they gain new customers.  Her charisma and happiness help her make good sales in a short time period.  \r\nFor that reason the money that she obtains is earned with greater speed, and in addition, it allows her to organize her time and complete domestic tasks in her home.

She resides in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County. The county is located by the sea and is known for their beaches and fish.  In addition, many logging companies are also located in the city.  People in Buchanan are known in the country for their love of fufu, a cassava based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.\r\n \r\nShe is 34 and married with two children, ages 10 and 1. They are both living at home but only one is in school. Korto has owned her own small local shop business selling soap, flour, sugar, rice, etc for the past 10 years.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more goods.  On average, she works 12 hours at her business from Monday to Saturday.  She started her business with a little money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by shared taxi.  She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge.  Her favorite part of her business is the profit.  In the future, she would like to build a modern house. She is grateful for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1363145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

People in Buchanan are known in the country for their love of fufu, a cassava based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. \r\n\r\nShe is 28 and single, and she has a four-year-old child.  Her child is currently living at home and attending school.  \r\n\r\nEsther has owned her own small local business selling rice, onions, oil, and other items for the past 10 years. She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more goods.  \r\n\r\nOn average, she works 9 hours at her business from Monday to Saturday. She started her business with a small amount of money from her fiancee. She transports her merchandise by shared taxi. She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is making profits.

Kenya University. He has 6 children and has been doing this work for 6 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, and tea.\r\n\r\nHe says that doing farming activities is the most enjoyable thing about farming. His biggest challenge is inadequate funds. The animals on his farm have not been given names.\r\n\r\nNathan was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, and he cited the organization's good loan terms. When asked what he  learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, Nathan said \"It offers training to farmers.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. He said that this loan would improve his family's living standards.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

Aminata.

Aminata established a fruit-selling business 15 years ago. She began her business because she needed an income to support her home. Aminata works 10 hours a day, six days a week. Her major business challenge is her poor location. \r\n\r\nAminata is requesting a loan to buy more fruit such as mango, banana, and apple to sell. She hopes that the extra income from her loan will allow her to expand her business and have a permanent business structure. In the future, Aminata plans to own her own permanent residence.

Northwestern Guatemala in Quiche. There are seven women in the group whose average age is 41 years. As each of the women has a large family, they each need to have their own businesses to contribute earnings to meet the needs of their families. Their goal is to provide the very best for their children so that they can enjoy a better life. The women realize that education is a vital key to the future of themselves and their children. \r\n\r\nThe current president and one of the youngest members of the Trust Bank is Aracely de los Angeles Petrona. She is the 28-year-old mother of three boys. Her priority is to give her boys a healthy diet and a good education. Aracely is in her final year of high school and wants to continue her education in accounting. She can see how this course of study will greatly benefit her in her business. \r\n\r\nAracely is in the textile business. She sews, weaves and sells typical skirts called \"cortes,\" which are large tubes of colorful, woven material that are wrapped around the wearer and then secured with a belt called a \"faja.\" She began the business eight years ago. Her business grew and Aracely applied for her first loan with Friendship Bridge approximately three years ago. She currently employs three local people who help her meet the requests of her clients. Her employees are excited to have a job as unemployment is quite high in Guatemala. Aracely is requesting a new loan which she will use to purchase a foot loom. The expansion of Aracely's business will not only benefit her own family but also three other families as well!\r\n\r\nIn her own words, \"I very much appreciate the opportunity to get a loan and grow my business. Currently, I deliver thirty dozen skirts each week to wholesalers. With the additional third employee who I have just hired, I can produce more skirts. Also, with the additional income, I can keep my own children in school (kindergarten and 2nd grade) and support my own education that I will complete this year.\"\r\n\r\nOn behalf of her fellow members of the Trust Bank \"Dios Nos Ayudara,\" Aracely thanks each Kiva investor who believes that a micro-loan and education can have such a far reaching impact, not only in Guatemala but throughout the world. With their businesses expanding, the women are able to see a brighter future for themselves, their families and their communities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2775,"image":{"id":1363376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Using those materials, her husband can repair and insulate their house. As a result, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and then contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

She lives in her own home together with her family, and what she most desires is to be able to work in order to generate the resources that will enable her to enjoy her future and a peaceful old age.  Tania works as a seamstress.  She designs, creates and alters different items of clothing such as blouses, pants or shirts according to the needs of the client.  She learned this work from the time she was young because she helped her cousin in a business. Thanks to that time invested she was able to learn the necessary skills so that she herself could begin her own business.  For that reason she now has her own shop and from there she attends to the requirements of her customers who fortunately have been growing in number with the passage of time.  She has been working in this field for five years and occasionally she receives help from another woman when she has very large requests.  What she likes about this activity is that she can count on the economic income with which she can manage household expenses.  At this time she is asking for 300 Soles (Peruvian currency).  She thanks everyone who makes this loan possible so that she can meet her work goals.  With the requested loan, she will buy materials like thread, needles, buttons, fabric, lining, and lace.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1363309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials like thread, needles, buttons, fabric, lining, and lace.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-31T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-30T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":47.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":52.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":54.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.03},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.98,"local_amount":93.55,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":104.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975789},{"amount":20.5,"local_amount":49.21,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":54.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997056},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":49.54,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":55.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864526},{"amount":22.03,"local_amount":52.89,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:28Z","rounded_local_amount":59.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352894},{"amount":22.84,"local_amount":54.81,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":61.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904663}],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T15:27:31Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":567313,"name":"Josefa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefa is a retail store owner and sells grocery items to the people in her village daily.

in-law. The family owns a small plot of agricultural land, where they grow greens and a few vegetables for their personal use. Nugzar is currently working for a local aircraft construction company as an artisan and receives a small monthly salary.\r\n\r\nNugzar and his family would like to start a family dairy farm business. He has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up capital, but without success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n \r\nNugzar is now requesting a loan from Credo to start up the family business. He has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan funds, Nugzar will purchase a milk cow. His wife will milk the cow daily and the family will produce dairy products that will be sold among the local people. In this way, the family will earn an additional income.  \r\n\r\nThis new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Construction in Birmingham, Ala. for 12 years. He and his four full-time and two part-time employees specialize in home improvements such as roofing, construction, deck and fence building, remodels, and new construction. To accommodate a growing business, Carlton needed to lease a building to store his construction materials and his tools. \r\n\r\nDespite his many years of experience, a steady flow of clientele, and his truck as collateral, Carlton said he had difficulty acquiring a loan to pay for his storage building. \r\n\r\n\u201cI tried five banks and they all turned me down,\u201d Carlton said. \r\n\r\nOne day while Carlton was visiting City Hall in Birmingham, he told a representative at the Office of Economic Development about his challenges. The representative referred him to Accion Texas Inc. Though Carlton was happy to learn about this opportunity, he had some apprehensions about applying for a loan again. \u201cIt gets to the point where you feel like you\u2019re going to be turned down again and you get tired of trying,\u201d he said. \r\n\r\nBut he said he was pleasantly surprised at how simple and easy it was to acquire his $5,000 loan.  \u201cIt went so smoothly, I was shocked,\u201d Carlton said. \u201cI never expected it to go through as smoothly as it did. I tell everybody it\u2019s the greatest experience and you need to go to Accion.\u201d\r\n\r\nCarlton used the funds to assist with business expenses, office equipment, a storage facility for materials and supplies, and salaries for his employees.  Carlton stressed the importance of employee retention for his company and assured a portion of the loan funds will go to salaries. The loan allowed Carlton\u2019s company to save and store needed materials instead of discarding them or risk ruining them while they were left outside.  \r\n\r\nThe company currently has a steady flow of customers and Carlton is excited about his future.  The Accion loan has allowed him to further his dream and continue to grow. He said he plans to quickly pay off his loan so he can build his credit and finance other business expansion projects. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe loan I received from Accion helped me so much,\u201d Carlton said. \u201cI appreciate it so much and am just so grateful to God that somebody gave me this

This is 59-year-old Triyiphina from Bulawayo. She is single with two children, both attending school. Triyiphina runs a manufacturing business producing mainly knitwear, which includes jerseys, woolen hats and baby wear. She also does cross border trading. The business has been in operation for 10 years. She says the main challenges faced are competition and the high cost of raw materials. Triyiphina has requested a loan of $500 (USD) to buy more raw materials of wool, thread and sewing fabric to make jerseys and other winter wear.

His mother is a teacher in the local kindergarten, earning a small monthly salary, and his father is a retired policeman who is able to provide the family with additional income from his pension. \r\n \r\nTeimuraz has requested a loan from Credo to start up his grocery business. He has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Teimuraz will purchase grocery stocks and open his store. He is a very hard-working man and intends to fulfill all the business needs for the shop himself. This will decrease his expenses and increase his profit. \r\n\r\nPart of the profit from Teimuraz's new venture will be reinvested back into the business, in order to expand the variety of the shop's product inventory.

She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit, Lamzira will purchase household goods from the big market in the capital city at wholesale prices. She will bring them to her district and sell among the villagers with a price markup. This will give her an opportunity to earn additional income for the family. She will use part of the profit for reinvesting in the same business, to purchase more stock of household goods. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Zaur requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nZaur is working at the local wood workshop as a wood artisan. His wife is working at a restaurant as a cook helper. They both earn small monthly salaries. Additional family income is Zaur\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n\r\nZaur requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Zaur will purchase equipment for wood processing and open his own wood workshop. As he is already experienced in this field and is well known among the villagers, Zaur will have a good number of clients. As Zaur will not be dependent on a small salary anymore, and will have private orders, his income will significantly increase. He will work hard and log many hours to try and expand his business.

From the time she was very young she has gone through difficult times, but that did not diminish her happiness and desire to move ahead, despite the fact that her parents had very few economic resources. With a lot of effort and dedication, Yesenia succeeded in studying Education. Because of this, every day Yesenia gets up very early, since she teaches classes at a primary school. She works around 9 hours per day, and with the fruit of her labor she supports her parents with the household expenses. She believes that she is moving ahead because she likes her profession a lot, and above all she wants to contribute to the children's future through her teaching.\r\n\r\nYesenia is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help they have given her she will be able to buy desks, a blackboard, chairs, and school supplies, among other items. Yesenia gives private classes in her home and currently she does not have the necessary supplies to make the children comfortable in class. This way, her students will study in better conditions and she will be able to improve her income, and she will continue fighting in order to be able to make her biggest dream a reality: to receive her professional license and be able to support her

She has become well known and has installed her own workshop.\r\nNow she designs, creates and manufactures all types of clothes. She has the assistance of two women who help her fulfill her customers' orders.
