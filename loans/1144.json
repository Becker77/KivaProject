She started her venture with savings that she gathered over several years, and she has been running her business for the past five years. As she is the most successful person in her family, they depend upon her for support. She has earned a great deal of respect through her business and she is proud of her success. \r\n\r\nRose lives in the St. Paul area of  Montserrado County with her husband and their three children. The children are between the ages of 10 and 18 years old and are all attending school. Rose herself did not have the opportunity to attend school, and her goal is to see her children attain a university education.\r\n\r\nRose cites poor road conditions leading to her shop as a major business obstacle, as she believes she is losing income due to this problem.

She lives in a small village of Kaspi District, with her parents-in-law, who are provided with a retirement pension. Marina requested a loan from local financial institutions several times, for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMarina works as a cooker, at a local poultry factory. The job pays totally 300 Laris per month. It is hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNow, Marina has requested a loan from Credo, to start up a family business. Marina has been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith this credit, Marina will purchase two milking cows.

The name of the group was chosen because it is the name where they live.  Mrs. Filo, as she is known in the community, is the representative.  She is 64 years old and is married to Leonardo.  They began their family 42 years ago and have seven children of whom only one still remains a dependent.  Mrs. Filo works raising animals like yearling sheep and goats.  She began raising small animals out of necessity 12 years ago: \"All of my children were studying and the salary of my husband was not enough to support all the educational and household expenses and thus I felt obligated to begin work with the raising of small animals and thanks to that my children were able to finish high school.\"  She is asking for a loan in order to purchase more sheep, feed and grass for the sheep that she currently has and for those that she will buy.  Mrs. Filo comments that one of her challenges is the lack of a good corral where she can keep her goats since the rainy season is approaching and they can get sick and die.  Mrs. Filo has to make a great effort to raise and fatten her animals because buying the feed is not easy.  However, despite all these difficulties she wants to eventually have more animals in order to continue helping her son with his studies.  Filo comments: \"I don't want my son to have to leave school due to a lack of money.  I would like to see him succeed professionally.\"  Daniel is the other group member and he comments that he is asking for a loan in order to buy more sheep to raise and sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1362290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy yearling sheep, corn and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santiago Oxtempan, El Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-05-31T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-30T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Filogonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":3666.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840183},{"amount":291.66,"local_amount":3666.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698560},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":3666.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944808},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":3666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227884},{"amount":291.66,"local_amount":3666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991747},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":3666.65,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644414}],"funded_date":"2013-06-05T20:55:06Z","paid_date":"2013-12-18T00:12:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":567453,"name":"Arthur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arthur is a farmer in the remote village of Bubare in Mbarara district, married with five children, all in school.

She learned this occupation from her spouse who learned the art of carving stone in the city of Santa Marta and then brought it to San Juan Nepomuceno where he perfected it and turned it into his alternate way of earning income to cover household expenses and provide well-being at home.  Currently, Karen works in this same art to help out her spouse.

Her greatest challenge is having enough money to make a high volume purchase thus reducing transportation costs associated with bringing the raw material from so far away.

municipality and is 35 years old. She became pregnant when she was in secondary three, at the age of 14, and because it was a taboo in her culture, she was chased from her parents\u2019 home and sought refuge at her grandmother\u2019s home. She then started supporting her grandmother in making handcrafted items, which was her grandmother\u2019s main source of survival alongside farming. \r\n\r\nUsing her small amount of savings, Provia managed to set up a crafts kiosk in the central market. She later obtained a loan of 500,000 UGX from Ugafode, which she used to expand her business. This has helped her to prosper and look after her children, which motivated her to mobilize women in her village to form a development group called Ainebyoona Hand Craft Group.

She indicates that she\u2019s been in Pro Mujer for two years having joined thanks to an invitation by a family member who is a member of the institution.  She currently has a business making and selling flannel clothes.  She learned this business from her sister who is in the same line of work.  With help from her mother she set up her own sales space four years ago.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019ll take out now is to increase capital.  She will buy fabric and a sewing machine in street markets in El Alto and after making them will sell them in her sales space.  This way of working makes it possible for her to generate income to support her family in any way possible since she\u2019s single but still living with her mother.

These products are sold in stores in the city and also in the streets and squares of Cartagena. Whole families participate in this trade and this legacy has been passed on from generation to generation.

The group is located in San Miguel Soyaltepec. They chose this name because it is the name of the street where they have their meetings. It is located a few meters from the river from the reservoir Cerro de Oro.\r\nQuirino is one of the members of the communal bank. He is married and has three children. They are all studying, but one of them is already in college. Quirino only has primary studies because studying was difficult and expensive, so he approached an acquaintance who was a carpenter and asked for a job. He learned the trade quickly and when he grew up decided to open his own furniture workshop. He has been doing this for 20 years and over the years he has earned a reputation for doing a good job. Quirino also says that thanks to his workshop he has provided for his family and has opened other smaller businesses such as a car wash business. He also bought a sound system to provide music for parties.\r\nQuirino is very happy and he says his businesses are also family businesses because in the afternoons he teaches his children the

They are above all very cheerful and always smiling. They have known each other for several years from the community where they live, which is very peaceful.\r\nThe members of the group chose the name \"princesas\" (princesses) for the communal bank because they consider themselves pretty.\r\nAgustina is the representative of the group. She is affectionately nicknamed Gutis. She is 42 years old and has been married for 11 years to Bernardo, who works as a construction worker. Together they have 3 children who are attending school.\r\nGutis has had a sewing workshop for 9 years. She opened it because she had worked in a clothing factory but decided to start her own business. She also took some courses to improve the quality of her work. She makes suits but also does fittings and alterations. Her customers make their orders in advance and Gutis works upon request on the garments and alterations previously ordered.\r\nGutis says that despite the amount of effort invested in her work, sometimes her earnings are very meager, so she also breeds and fattens pigs, as an additional source of income.\r\nIn her sewing workshop everything is going well, except for one of her sewing machines which broke down.

He lives in a very peaceful community where the majority of residents work in commerce, selling costumes, chicken, bread, groceries, and prickly pear; it can easily be seen that this community is economically active. Ram\u00f3n is 27 and has been married to Marisol for some time now. Together they have built a family with three children, none of whom are currently in school. Ram\u00f3n has cultivated prickly pear for five years. He started this work because he wanted to improve his family's quality of life somehow. He says that he plants the prickly pear in medium-sized bushes. He takes care of them for one year. In order to sell them, Ram\u00f3n needs to fertilize them while they are growing. He also needs to water them whenever they need it, and keep them safe from snowfall; often, this can burn the plants, meaning a loss of income and investment. \r\nRam\u00f3n is requesting a loan for the purchase of fertilizer for his prickly pear plants. He says that the cultivation of these plants is going very well for him, except that he is often in need of money to keep them in good condition. He needs fertilizer, he says, in order to care for them during the December snowfall, but after that it's never impossible to get good sales during the months of March, April, and May.\r\nRam\u00f3n and Marisol sell the plants in the plazas together. His goal is to one day have large greenhouses; at the moment he only has small greenhouse spaces, which does not allow him to cultivate on a larger scale; however, having larger greenhouses means more costs. He is very happy with this loan, because this way he will be able to move forward bit by bit and one day reach his dream, and his family will have a better quality of

She anticipates hiring an additional part-time massage therapist to assist with the growing business. Part of the loan will also be used to renovate her space where she conducts the massages and to purchase oils, lotions, and towels for her massage services.  \r\n\r\nRoslyn is excited about her future, business, and finding that perfect balance in her life.       \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1363941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase oils, lotions, and towels, and to renovate her space where she conducts the massages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-05-31T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-30T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roslyn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":567601,"name":"Melynda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In her hometown of Ft.

She is a very happy woman, but above all, she is very hard-working.  She is a 58 year old widow.  She does not now have any dependent children.  However, she is also the one who takes care of her grandson\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nGregoria has had a grocery store for 38 years.  She started it because there were not any stores where you could buy groceries.  That is how Gregoria and her husband decided to set up a grocery store.  This time she is requesting the loan to stock her grocery store.  She will buy milk, soft drinks, bread, eggs, sugar, and salt, etc.  The only difficulty she currently has is the great amount of competition in her community, which has greatly reduced her sales.\r\n\r\nGregoria needs a refrigerator in her store in order to start selling dairy products, yogurt, cream, cheese, and ham, etc.  This would help her to increase her profits and, this way, improve her family\u2019s quality of life.  Gregoria\u2019s only goal is to have her grocery store full again, to have everything, and to never again tell her customers that she does not have what they are asking for.\r\n\r\nLilia, Mois\u00e9s, \u00c1ngel, Filiberta, Ofelia, and Isabel will buy household products.

together with her family in an old house. Her home does not meet the standards of living, and she urgently needs to repair it.  She is 43 years old, and is married to a man who could not find suitable work in his homeland and went abroad to Russia in order to work.

She makes a living selling cosmetics, having started the work three years ago.  In the beginning, Tania was only looking for an income to support her parents with household costs but it is now a huge help to the family.  To start the business, Tania needed capital and, given that she didn't have any at the time, she took on various jobs so that she could save up.  Later, with her parent's support, she was able to start her business.  Now she has a variety of stock but she had to put a lot of effort into the business - she had to look for customers, go out to sell her products and customers had pay cash until she became known in the area.  Now with experience and a good customer base, Tania has seen improvements in her business.  She is earning more and, in the future, she hopes to be able to open her own shop to sell beauty products and cosmetics.  That way, her sales would increase and so would her income.

His eldest son works abroad, but his youngest son lives at home and helps his parents.  Oblokul's wife, Hochaloi, works on the farm during the day, and in the morning and evening, she feeds and takes care of their cattle and milks their cows.  Oblokul helps his wife feed the cattle, but his main job is tending to their crops.  They have three hectares of land where they grow wheat, but their primary source of income is from raising cattle.  Because of this, Oblokul wants to buy cattle to increase the size of their herd, however they don't have enough cash on hand to do this.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Oblokul has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan.  He hopes to buy cows in order to earn more profits.

The people, like our members, are friendly, kind, and good humored and have a common goal which is to help their families to get ahead and to offer them a better future. They work in different fields such as agriculture, livestock raising, and business, and they maintain the culture and traditions of their people. \r\nOne of the members of this group is Perla. This is her third loan with the Arco Iris community bank and she likes the bank for the fellowship, unity, and good humor of the group members and for the loans that help her to improve and grow her business.

Her husband is a teacher and the house they live in is their own. \r\nPerla works in informal business selling costume jewelry and sandals. She works alone on market days without a fixed timetable.
