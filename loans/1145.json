At her parents' will, she was married at the young age of 16.  She now has four children and she's happy.  But it's not an easy job to raise and provide for her children.  Her husband works abroad in the Russian Federation and she alone has to raise her children.  Her husband at least sends money, but it's not enough for their needs.  Shoirakhon's eldest daughter is already old enough and it's time to give her away in marriage.  Shoirakhon has to earn this money herself.\r\n\r\nShe started by working at the local market as a sales person selling children's clothes.  Little by little, she saved up enough money and opened her own store not far from her home.  Shoirakhon buys her goods in another city and sells them for a profit in her town.  And so for five years now, she has been independently working in this line of business.  Now, since the demand for her goods has increased, Shoirakhon wants to expand her business.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan.  She wants to use the loan to buy a new assortment of children's clothes.

The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. He worked in Korea on an employment contract from 1999 to 2000 and came back to Mongolia in order to begin his tourism business with a Korean business partner. But in 2012, his business partner, who is Korean, gave up on this business because of a health issue. \r\n\r\nNow, Altantur is employed by a USA invested company as a sales manager. His main duty is to meet with customers at home and introduce his products. He drives around the city a lot, and his automobile is his main tool for his job.

The area is known for its beautiful landscapes thanks to its rugged geography and it is possible to enjoy nature.  The architecture of the homes is a mix of modern and traditional.  The people, including the group members, are people with good hearts who are friendly and kind.  Every day they are in a fight to improve their financial stability and they are succeeding thanks to their work, effort, and dedication.  They do work such as raising animals, farming, and many work in the city at other economic activities while maintaining the culture and traditions of their people.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Elda, who is requesting her second loan together with her friends and companions.  She likes this type of loan because it helps them improve their financial stability.  Elda is 39 years old, married, and has six children who are 13, 16, 18, 18, 20, and 22 years old.  Her two oldest children are married and live independently.  Her twin daughters work for their personal expenses and are also studying at a school in the city.  Her 16 year old son is also studying at a school in the city.  Her youngest son who has a disability is studying at a school for special children.  Her husband works in construction as a builder.

the capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on their own plot of land. He has been running a taxi service to local people since 2009 and has accumulated a vast amount of experience in picking up customers, driving them to their destination quickly and taking short routes. His wife has been making and selling Mongolian traditional clothes, called deel, to local people. Using his previous loan, he purchased an electric sewing machine for his wife's business in order to increase her labor efficiency. He is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase some sheep. During the summer time, he will feed the sheep and later in autumn he will sell them at a higher price in the markets. By beginning this business, he will improve his family's living condition greatly.

Karina has been with the communal bank for three years and she likes it because the loans have helped her with her business a great deal.\r\n\r\nKarina's dream is to have a bigger stationery shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1349277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy notebooks, pens and all types of school materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Charapoto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-06-01T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-01T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1576.11,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":197.01},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":197.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":197.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":197.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":197.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":197.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":197.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":197.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":799.98,"local_amount":788.04,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":799.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381704193},{"amount":599.99,"local_amount":591.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":599.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566617},{"amount":200.03,"local_amount":197.04,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":200.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815635}],"funded_date":"2013-06-02T01:51:01Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:32:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":564504,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is 40 years old, married, and blessed with three children between the ages of 3 and 15 years old.

As each passing day, her sales volume was increasing, so she rented an additional stall at another trade center. Now she sells not only children's clothes, but also various types of female and male clothes. She is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase various types of clothes from her suppliers. As a result, she can continue to run her business without worrying about inventory shortages.

She used the previous loans to keep increasing her stock of food. She started with just ten kilos of wheat flour, five kilos of beans, a bottle of cooking oil, a small packet of charcoal and one kilo of meat. But now she buys in bulk; for example, 50 kilos of wheat flour, 35 kilos of beans, two sacks of charcoal, a bucket of cooking oil, 20 kilos of meat, and all this is just in a week. \r\n\r\nShe used to only sell vitumbuwa (a kind of fried dough) and mandanzi (a type of doughnut), with beans early in the morning. But now after breakfast she sells food for lunch and dinner as well. She has paid back all her loans successfully.  She used the profit to buy a TV set, bought a land, bought her sofa set, paid school fees and covered household expenses. She will use this loan to restock the missing items in her food store. She dreams of owing a building.\r\n\r\nMerina will share this loan with her loan group \"MOMELA\" which has eleven members who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5225,"image":{"id":1358631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to restock the missing items in her food store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2013-06-02T12:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-02T12:00:03Z","loan_amount":5225,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yasin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frank","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mwajabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muhsin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":8500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1062500},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1062500},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1062500},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1062500},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1062500},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1062500},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1062500},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1062500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1306.25,"local_amount":2125000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2127200.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381830036},{"amount":1959.38,"local_amount":3187500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3190800.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390688266},{"amount":1277.97,"local_amount":2079000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2081152.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399934905},{"amount":681.4,"local_amount":1108500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1109647.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410218191}],"funded_date":"2013-06-06T20:02:05Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T19:41:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":565792,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is a married man.

the capital city of Mongolia. She has been selling casual clothes to local people at a trade centre since 2008 and has accumulated a vast amount of experience. Her husband has been running a taxi service using his own car. Her elder daughter studies at university, while her younger daughter is currently studying at kindergarten and next year will enrol in elementary school. As her children are growing up, their needs are increasing so she and her husband have decided to launch a new business - purchasing livestock from the countryside and later selling it to local people. Thus, she is requesting a loan of 4200000 Mongolian tugriks (MNT) to buy cattle and sheep. If their first sale is successful, it will greatly improve their living standards. Mr Oyunkhand is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

three children, whom she loves and are her main purpose in life.  She is a friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic person who decided to dedicate all her effort to getting her family ahead because she has always been both mother and father to her children.  Unfortunately, due to lack of financial resources and because she had to work from the time she was very young to help out her parents, Emilia never got to get the degree in business administration she wanted.  In her free time she likes to watch movies and sometimes cook up a delicious lamb stew with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with lots of determination and dedication, Emilia works as a field hand on a farm in her city.  She works every day for about eight hours and believes things are going well due to her good performance and kind treatment of others.  She is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she'll be able to improve her house; she wants to plaster the walls, paint, and lay flooring because she lives in an area of very high humidity, the main cause of residue.  With the improvements Emilia can provide more security and well-being to the family, so she'll keep working and striving to achieve her biggest dream--to have a grocery store in her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1353982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She will keep working and striving to achieve her big dream of practicing as a nurse in a hospital in her city.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1354035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-02T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-02T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#PowerfulStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katherine Cristabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":261.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.58},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.34,"local_amount":196.53,"processed_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":197.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664520},{"amount":163.94,"local_amount":427.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":429.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776073},{"amount":86.08,"local_amount":224.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":225.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779233},{"amount":183.44,"local_amount":478.53,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":481.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819326},{"amount":97.38,"local_amount":254.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":255.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472284},{"amount":100.35,"local_amount":261.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":263.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694786},{"amount":443.47,"local_amount":1156.88,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1163,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067354}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T06:54:10Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T09:56:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":566686,"name":"Bansah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bansah sells engine oil at Ve-Wudome, Hohoe Lorry Park.

She doesn't have a home of her own and lives with her mother and helps her with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAna is a housewife but she raises and sells Guinea pigs, pigs, and livestock in order to get her family ahead.  She sells the animals within her community, and also works in agriculture and her products are for her family's consumption.  In the evenings she sells tamales and coffee from her home.  All these activities provide her the opportunity to improve her family stability and get her children ahead.  She likes to work in the fields very much because she can stay home and the home does not deteriorate.\r\n\r\nShe used the money from her previous loan to buy animal feed and ingredients for her tamales, from which she obtained some good earnings that she used to pay the household expenses.  She is asking for another loan so she can buy more pigs, Guinea pigs, and ingredients for her coffee and tamale business.\r\n\r\nShe likes the communal bank because the loans allow her to continue growing her business.

He has been living with his nephew Antonio for more than 10 years, and both are from the state of Coahuila. His nephew Antonio, who has always worked in restaurants and has a lot of food service experience, encouraged Jose Pablo to open a business grilling chicken. The two are very close and have made progress together. \r\n\r\nFour years ago, when Jose Pablo decided to start this project, he lacked sufficient capital and had to sell some electronics to raise the money to buy what he needed to start his business. He says his nephew had to work very hard to attract customers to the new business because their weren't many people living nearby. A year later, they moved the stall, and now the business is doing nicely. They want to remodel to attract more customers and also plan on opening another stall.

He would add some more space to it by building one more room. He would also buy a variety of goods like rice, sugar, soap, cereals, milk, and utility items for his general store. This would satisfy his clients more professionally, as well as increase his savings for the better future of his children.

three children in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. They have three buffalo and her husband sells buffalo milk to their neighbors and other people, which is the only source of income for their family. She wants to sell milk, yogurt and butter in the market on a large scale, for which the production should be increased. Shazia is facing a very difficult time as her monthly income is insufficient to meet household expenses. As a member of four-person group, Shazia has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BRAC Pakistan, to buy a new buffalo in order to increase the production of milk and increase her monthly income. After receiving the profits, she is planning to send her children to school. She is very hopeful that the loan will be a productive one for them. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their support.\r\n\r\nNOTE: In the picture Shazia is raising her
