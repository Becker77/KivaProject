She lives in Chinandega, located in the western part of the country and known for its commercial production.  Herika is a hardworking, responsible woman who has had to struggle since she was very young in order to be able to eat.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, she was not able to attend university.  She finished middle school but saw herself obligated to work at an early age in order to help with the household expenses.  She works hard every day to provide a better future for her children, so that they will have a better future and so that she can see them become professionals.  She buys and sells general merchandise and also has a small sewing workshop in her home, where she provides services to her neighbors.  She makes her purchases at the wholesale markets and stores in Chinandega and sells for cash and credit.  She has fixed customers and takes orders and also sells on foot.  She has used the previous loans to grow her business and make improvements to her house.  She is asking for this loan so she can buy general merchandise such as shoes, cosmetics, shampoo, plastic products, fabrics, threads, needles, decorative fabric, buttons, zippers, elastic, and other things to make various styles of dresses, shirts, sheets, and other things.

She has been running a business selling bathing soap from outside the country for five years now. She works from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Ester's third loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her four children. She loves her family and claims they are her greatest strength and reason for getting up each morning and working hard to generate an income. \r\n\r\nSince 2003, Riffat has been working as a tailor. She provides stitching services in her community. Her eldest daughter also helps her in stitching up dresses. She has excellent stitching skills and, with the money she generates, she has managed to provide a better quality of life for her family. Her greatest wish is to expand her business and to purchase one more sewing machine, as the number of her customers is increasing day by day. However, with only one machine, she cannot easily cope with all her customers on time, and that results in a loss of money and customers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Riffat is asking for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to invest in the purchase of a sewing machine, which will allow her to fulfill the demands of customers more efficiently and to elevate her level of income. With her profit, she will pay the educational expenses of her children. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, near Tanzania. Inconsistent rains, especially recently, have made farming difficult, and the poverty rates in the county are above the Kenyan average. Beekeeping is somewhat new to Kwale, but the passionfruit farms and mangrove forests throughout the area provide excellent sources of nectar for bee colonies. Many farmers  in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives, and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.  \r\n\r\nChitsaka has three children, and has been farming for eight years. She is currently tending to an orange orchard on her land. She is excited to start beekeeping because she sees it as a good source of income, and is looking forward to working with Honey Care because they give very good training.\r\n\r\nChitsaka has created a kindergarten program in her community, and volunteers her time to help teach and care for her pupils. With the income generated from her beehives, Chitsaka plans to sponsor kindergarten pupils, and pay the expenses for those children whose families cannot afford to front the minimal fees needed to buy teaching materials for the young girls and boys. Chitsaka's class is currently taught out of a small room with an unfinished roof, but her hope for the future is to save up enough money to build a proper classroom, so that her pupils have a good space to play and learn.

She has nine children and has been doing this work for 31 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea and crops.\n\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"Feeding cows.\" Her biggest challenge is \"diseases.\" Animals on the farm have been given the names of Maua and Ndume.\n\nSelta was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Juhudi Kilimo offers loans to farmers at a lower interest rate.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"Importance of saving money.\"\n\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit her family\" Selta replied, \"She will be able to educate my child.\"\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Selta owns the following: cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, TV or DVD.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

She says she didn't continue with her studies because she lacked the capital and her parents weren't able to continue supporting her anymore.  She has two children, one in elementary school and one who's five months old.\n\nShe says she makes a living selling fruits and vegetables in the town market.  She goes to the distribution center early in the day to stock up by choosing the best produce that's not bruised.  This way she can finish selling early.  She sells by the bag: avocado, Manzano peppers, blackberries, mango, peaches, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.\n\nMaking little bags earns her a bit more, she says.  She goes around the market selling from a bucket.  She likes what she does because she has time for her home and her children.  Her mother helps her by taking care of the children, and when she can't, Alejandra takes her child in one hand, her bucket in the other, and her baby in her shawl on her back, and goes out to sell.\n\nHer dream is to set up a stall outside the town market so she won't have to walk from one place to another, which is very tiring.\n\nShe says she's requesting her loan to stock up on seasonal fruits and vegetables because she wants to buy a bit more to increase her profits and give her young children a better quality of life.\n\nThe other members of the group are Nemesia, Mar\u00eda Cristina, Laura Cecilia, Mar\u00eda Teresa, Alicia, Araceli, Jazm\u00edn, Bel\u00e9n, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Alberta, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Rosalba, Jannet, Patricia, Tatiana, and Elisenia.  They'll invest their loans in buying and selling seasonal fruit, buying animal feed and extracting milk to sell, buying chicken feed and chickens to raise and sell, buying groceries for a store, and buying ingredients to make snacks.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6650,"image":{"id":1359173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-06-03T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-03T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":6650,"lender_count":136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nemesia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yazmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma.

","en":"Mamadmuso is 53 years old, married, and has three sons. He and his family live in the Khuroson district. Two of his sons are currently working abroad. For the past five years Mamadmuso has been raising farm animals, a business which he learned from his father as a child. The village where he lives is located at the foot of the mountains, where the environment is favorable for raising cattle, which he buys and fattens up for resale. Because the cattle market is only one kilometer from his home, he does not have to pay for travel expenses. He has requested a loan in order to purchase three head of cattle to raise and resell. By expanding his business, Mamadmuso can help his

So when it came time to choose a profession, it was clear to her that offering salon services was her calling. A mother of three girls, Tenesha said her hairstyling business provides for her children, and her hairstyling skills are useful for her girls at home.\n\nThrough her San Antonio business, Onyx Mobile Beauty Salon, Tenesha offers men and women the latest in hair care and spa services.  The salon on wheels is convenient and comes to clients when they schedule an appointment. Tenesha offers clients styles and cuts for men and women, extensions, braids, spa services, and beard trims, as well as teen spa and beauty packages, and bridal packages for their special days.  \n\nOriginally from Michigan, Tenesha continued her mobile hair care services when she moved to Texas. She got her big break when a stranger at a store saw the advertising on her truck and approached her about helping elderly people at nursing homes. \n\nTenesha said whether her clients are elderly or teen-aged, she treats everybody with respect and as an individual.\n\n\u201cYou have to be patient and gentle with everybody,\u201d Tenesha said. \u201cBut with kids you have to move quickly because they lose attention quickly.\u201d \n\nTenesha recently came to Accion Texas Inc. when an Accion employee informed her about the great services and loan programs the organization offers.  Tenesha is using her loan to pay for minor repairs on her business\u2019s mobile trailer and to hire three part-time stylists to assist with the upcoming summer months.  Tenesha is accustomed to the increase in business over the summer months due to clients planning summer weddings and other events during warmer weather.  \n\n\u201cI like working with all types of people,\u201d she said.\n\nAlong with everyday salon services, Tenesha also offers special pricing packages for groups of six or more.  Packages include a princess inspired teen party, all male spa and haircut party, and bridal party extravaganzas all at reasonable prices.  Each client will be treated to an oasis with the very best massage, pedicure, manicure, and hair style suitable for any occasion. \n\nShe is grateful to have her Accion loan to increase her working capital and hire help during this time.

His love for music has evolved into his start-up company Trap Boy Enterprise located in Fort Worth, Texas.  Born and raised in Fort Worth he is aware of the music scene and what is current.  He recently started his company with a loan from Accion Texas Inc. and is ready to make beautiful music.\r\n\r\nFrank has invested thousands of dollars in his business, and since its inception in May 2013, has hired one full-time employee to assist with the business needs, and purchased the necessary equipment for his performances.  Although Frank experienced a brief struggle to get where he is today, Accion Texas Inc. has made the journey a little easier, he says.  Frank discovered Accion from the Small Business Administration office in the Dallas\/Fort Worth area and applied for a $5,450 loan.  After receiving approval, Frank began making additional future plans for his company.\r\n\r\nCurrently Frank offers his own beats that he produced, emcee services at local clubs and venues around the Fort Worth and Dallas area, and DJs for parties and clubs around his area, too.  Frank is always current on the latest music and entertainment scene to offer his customers the best beats and music around.  \r\n\r\nFrank plans to use his loan to advertise, market his services to acquire more performances, hire a part-time employee and perform maintenance on his music-producing machines.  He credits Accion for helping him further his love of music and childhood dream to one day become a famous DJ and music producer.

By \"improve,\" they mean to buy 5-gallon water bottles and labels, change system pieces, paint walls and other investments.\n\nMercedes is the pastor in this church and also is in change of the water project called Agua Vida Sana (Water Healthy Lives). In their neighborhood live around 15 thousand people, and their plan is to distribute purified water to 2500 families, at a cost of $0.50 US for a 5-gallon bottle of water. With this, Mercedes said, they want to impact different areas: economic, health, spiritual and many others. This community is an extremely poor area in Santo Domingo with many health problems, potable water scarcity, diseases, pollution, etc. This project is planning to distribute 300 of these bottles for at least 2500 families and businesses daily. This church is committed to starting as many projects as they can to contribute to the development of this community.\n\nMercedes thanks God, Esperanza Internacional, and all of you for this opportunity.

They sell the harvested products and cheese locally, at a good price. The income is hardly enough money for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Ramaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Ramaz will purchase bee-hives with bee-colonies. After purchasing bee-hives with bee-colonies, the family will be able to produce honey for sale. Honey is a highly-demanded product, as well as very profitable, so Ramaz hopes this will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Lana will purchase a stock of groceries and resell at higher prices.

The farm produces barely enough to adequately support the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.  \r\n\r\nNodar would like to start up a grocery store business. He has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up capital, but without success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n  \r\nNodar has now requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Nodar will open a grocery store. He will purchase a stock of groceries and also renovate a space near the family house to open his shop. Though Nodar has no experience as yet, he is very motivated to make his new business a success and to increase the income of his family. \r\n\r\nThis new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

The family resides in a small barn on a plot of land surrounded by block fences. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 MNT in order to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass, and foam. Using those materials, she intends to build an extension to her small wooden barn. This will help her family to live in a warmer and more comfortable place. The renovated dwelling will also reduce the family's coal usage, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution by releasing fewer pollutants. \r\n\r\nMrs. Altanchimeg is a very hard-working individual who strives for a better future.

She has a business of refilling mineral water, called \"Hijau Daun\". The Kiva loans benefit her, as Nurul is a widow with two children. Her husband died a few years ago.

He lives in a small village of Ozurgeti District, with his wife, parents, grandmother, and an infant daughter. His grandmother is provided with a retirement pension. Ramaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBesides Ramaz's grandmother's pension, the only source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. In particular, they have milking cows, whose milk is used in dairy products. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land, where maize and nut trees are grown.  They sell the harvested produce and dairy products locally, at good prices. They earn hardly enough for food, for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ramaz has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to other credit products.

The only source of income for the family is from growing different kinds of fruit on a half hectare of land and selling the harvested products locally. Though they are able to sell their produce at a good price, it is still hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nVakhtang would like to start a taxi business. He has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to obtain family business start-up capital, but without success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n \r\nVakhtang has now requested a loan from Credo to start up his taxi business, and he has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Vakhtang will purchase a car and serve the local people as a taxi driver. This will increase the income of the family.

age 42, lives in the small village of Telavi District with her husband, their young son, and her parents-in-law. Lela\u2019s husband works in transportation and gets a small monthly income. Her parents-in-law are provided with a small retirement pension. Though they pool their income, it is hardly enough to provide sufficient food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLela would like to start a clothes trading business. She is experienced in this field as she was involved in a trading business three years ago. She has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to obtain family business start-up capital, but without success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nLela has now requested a loan from Credo in order to start up her clothes trading business, and she has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Lela will begin trading in clothing items. She plans to go to Turkey, where she will purchase clothing from wholesalers, and then she will resell these items among her local villagers at a higher price. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1364741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to begin a clothes trading business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kurdghelauri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-03T21:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-03T21:10:13Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":55.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.39},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.36,"local_amount":43.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":43.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613699},{"amount":45.31,"local_amount":45.31,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":45.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857411},{"amount":46.48,"local_amount":46.48,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":46.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134059},{"amount":48.4,"local_amount":48.4,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":48.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107648},{"amount":48.93,"local_amount":48.93,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":48.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255189},{"amount":767.52,"local_amount":767.52,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":767.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019327}],"funded_date":"2013-06-09T01:43:41Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":565387,"name":"Benita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

is 57 years old and married with three children. He has been selling rice, beans, eggs, spaghetti, chicken, meat, and more for ten years. Tahir's business is in his home, and his customers are his friends and neighbors who visit him from Monday through Sunday. His sales are very good.\r\n\r\nTahir is asking for a 2000 AZN loan to buy products for his grocery store such as rice, beans, eggs, chicken, meat, salami, pasta, bread, soft drinks, juices, and milk to be able to earn more in his business.

She's a single mother who has worked and supported her children all by herself. Today her children are independent adults. She faced many hardships back when she didn't have a home of her own, but now she has received a small plot of land as a donation from an outreach program and there she set up a small, improvised house. Her only means of livelihood is selling sweets that she herself makes. She sells them in the streets on a door-to-door basis. She requests the loan in order to purchase supplies for making the sweets. She'll also buy a small industrial kitchen, since the one she has now is handcrafted and it's a little risky and worn-out. That way she'll be able to use her sales to afford her primary expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1359787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is the mother of three children, ages 17, 13, and 7, to whom she devotes her life, and together with her husband, she exerts herself greatly to give them a dignified life and above all to make them good people. Her home is located in the city of Nazca, a city characterized by having a very warm climate. Furthermore, we find many tourist attractions [here], such as the Nazca Lines, which receive a myriad of tourists throughout the year. When Luzmila has free time, she very much likes to watch television, especially her soap operas, and sometimes she likes very much to eat one of her favorite dishes, which is the very delicious \"Seco de Res\" (cilantro beef stew). Due to her scarce resources, she went only to secondary school, but she very much would have liked to do university studies.\r\n\r\nDay after day Luzmila works very hard as a farmer on her parcel of land, which is seeded in cactus [for its fruits], and she also sells cochineal. Cochineal is an insect that is used to give color to various products, especially textiles. She works about 6 hours a day, since she always has to review her crops and also verify that the cochineal is maturing. She believes that things are going very well for her in her business because she is very responsible and hardworking, and above all because she has a great will to advance.\r\n\r\nLuzmila is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since this is the second time that they have offered her their support, and with it, Luzmila will be able to complete a new infestation of cochineal and maintain her crops, in particular, to fertilize them with compost and irrigate them, among other tasks. Thus in this way she will be able to have a good harvest and improve her income, which will allow her to continue working and advancing and striving to make her greatest dream a reality: to finish constructing her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1113732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to begin an infestation of cochineal and purchase  compost, fertilizers, and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-04T00:00:54Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-04T00:00:54Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3014.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819886}],"funded_date":"2013-06-06T19:48:28Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T12:58:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":564682,"name":"Dora Angelica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia continua dedicandose al negocio de broasteria,la socia lleva buen tiempo con su negocio el cual le va bien gracias al empe\u00f1o que le pone cada dia a su negocio,la socia trabaja desde las 08:00am hasta las 07:00pm, siendo de esta forma que la socia saca adelante a su familia.\nLa socia solicita el credito para comprar pollos,aceite entre otros.\n\nLa socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.","en":"She continues with her Broasted chicken business.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMadona requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit, Madona will open a used clothing shop. She has space on the first floor of her house, where she will open a shop for used clothing. This will increase the income of their household. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions for the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1364806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to open a used clothing shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Batumi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-04T02:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-04T02:50:07Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":106.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":123.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":128.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":129.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":132.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":139.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":139.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":143.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":146.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":150.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":153.24},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":156.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":161.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":164.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":168.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.43},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.83,"local_amount":106.83,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":106.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613702},{"amount":115.18,"local_amount":115.18,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":115.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857414},{"amount":117.94,"local_amount":117.94,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":117.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134062},{"amount":122.43,"local_amount":122.43,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":122.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107651},{"amount":123.7,"local_amount":123.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":123.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255192},{"amount":128.14,"local_amount":128.14,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":128.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019330},{"amount":1785.78,"local_amount":1785.78,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1785.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670459}],"funded_date":"2013-06-24T14:09:34Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:09:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":567990,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys is a 29-year-old married lady and a mother of three children aged between thirteen and two years old.

She did not go to school, but she is good at managing her business. She describes herself as a working woman.\r\nShe lives and works in St. Paul. St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, passed the Freeport. It is one of the poorer areas and one will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\nMarpu has a table business from which she sells palm oil, rice, etc for the past 10 years. She works ten hours a day at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is the small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.
