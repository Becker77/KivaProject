Communal bank \u201cBuena Aventura\u201d meets here fortnightly. This group is composed of ten women and two men who some time ago decided to come together and form a group that has helped them a lot to get ahead.\r\n\r\nAna, 30, is one of this group\u2019s members. She is married and has four children who are 14, 12, 8 and 6 years old. The two older children go to secondary school and the smaller ones to primary school. Her husband works in agriculture. Ana raises pigs and poultry in order to help her husband with the home expenses, which are considerable. She has a small barn at home where she takes care of these animals, making some money without leaving her house. This income helps her cover her children\u2019s studies; her husband makes too little to cover these expenses, since they are four and their education becomes expensive. Ana raises her pigs for four months and then sells them to middlemen who visit her at home. She slaughters the chickens herself and delivers them to shops in town, receiving even better profits.\r\n\r\nAna will use this new loan to buy animal feed and medicines for her pigs and chickens. This is her second cycle with the communal bank and she feels happy with the help she receives through these loans. Her dreams are to provide her children with the best and get ahead in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6700,"image":{"id":1356264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Igorora town. The group is composed of mainly women and one man with various marital statuses: single, widowed and married. \n\nAidah\u2019s enrollment in the group was a result of a series of hardships she had undergone as a semi-illiterate business person, among which was starting multiple businesses which would close in less than a year. This frustrated all her efforts, and she decided to sit at home as a housewife for over two years.

Bardnersville is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.

Her greatest challenge in business is a small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.

She did not go to school, but she is good at managing her business.  She describes herself as working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Bardnersville.  Bardnersville is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nFor the past two years, Meme has had a table business which sells fish.  She works ten hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is a small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

She is married and has four children, aged between 19 and 12. Only two of her children are currently attending school and live at home.  She did not go to school, and joined business to make her life easier.  She describes herself as working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in St. Paul.  St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nFor the past ten years, Rebecca has had a table business which sells slippers, body cream, etc..  She works ten hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is a small income. She intends to use the loan to buy more slippers, body cream, etc. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

She is divorced and has four children, aged between 32 and 11. Only two of her children are currently attending school and live at home.  She completed 12th grade before joining business.  She describes herself as working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in the St. Paul area.  St.Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nFor the past ten years, Sue B. has had a table business which sells milk, sugar, candles, etc.  She works ten hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is a small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

She is married and lives with her husband and two children in the town of Sevan. Her husband is a driver and works hard days and nights in order to sustain his family, so Susanna is in charge of the upbringing of their children. \r\n\r\nSusanna has a higher education and for five years she used to work as an accountant in Sevan. But for more than two years she has been jobless and so she raises cows, bulls and chickens at her farm. The products from farming Susanna sells in the Sevan food markets. She says that raising animals is a very hard occupation, especially for women, but at the same time it is very profitable. Susanna does her best to ensure a good future for her children.\r\n\r\nSusanna decided to increase the number of her animals and for this she asks a loan from Kiva lenders to buy two calves and fodder for animals. This is the sixth loan from Nor Horizon for Susanna and the first one from Kiva, and she hopes that her first deal with Kiva will have a good success for her agricultural business.

Francisca farms 4 hectares of land where she grows organic cacao.  She has been in this business for around 19 years and, up to now, she has had very good results.  She learned how to farm from her parents who also gave her a small plot of cacao when she decided to start working independently.  As she started making her own income, Francisca saved up and bought the rest of the plots that she currently owns.

Mongolia. The family resides in a rental apartment. For the past 13 years, Erdenetuul has been running a supermarket and she has accumulated vast amount of experience. Her husband is disabled. His health condition is getting better daily; now he walks, speaks, and does things on his own. Erdenetuul used her previous loan to expand her supermarket and diversify the products she offers.\r\n\r\nErdenetuul is requesting a 3,500,000 MNT loan to purchase building and insulation materials to repair and insulate an old house and leave her apartment. She lives in a ger district, rural area where central heating and sanitation systems are rare. Erdenetuul thinks that, instead of living in an apartment where the heat is stopped during the summer time, it is better for her husband's health to live in a house. She is aware that a renovated house won't require a large amount of heating coal and it is way better for preserving energy.

Gregoria did not complete her primary education, studying only up to her fourth year.  She could not continue her studies because her parents were poor and their income was spent on food, clothing and medicine, with many restrictions.  Gregoria is not only a farmer but also a saleswoman as she has a small convenience store that she runs in order to help her partner with their household expenses.  Before she started that business the couple occasionally found themselves in a tight spot as the income they made from farming was not much.  Gregoria's crops are located some 2 kilometers from her home.  Sometimes she travels there by vehicle and sometimes on foot owing to the high cost of fuel.\r\n\r\nGregoria currently needs help to buy manure, fertilizers and other inputs that will help to strengthen her coffee crops and ensure she enjoys a safe and clean harvest.\r\n\r\nGregoria's goal is to improve her coffee crops as they are a great help to her family when she enjoys an excellent harvest such as the one she is currently growing and producing.  Gregoria's dream is to further expand her plantings so that her children can work independently and grow a greater variety of crops because they will inherit the land that they are currently working."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1361836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy manure, fertilizers and other inputs for her coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-06-04T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-04T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1325,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25135.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812906}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T00:19:40Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:27:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":566416,"name":"Mar\u00eda Hercilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad, esta acompa\u00f1ada y tiene cuatro hijos.

capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. She has been running a souvenir and jewelry sales business since 2004 and her business is doing well. Her husband currently runs a framing workshop; he makes and sells frames to local vendors. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in is very small and can't provide enough space for this seven-member family. So Battsetseg is requesting a loan of 3,500,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, she and her husband will make an extension and add insulation to their house. The renovated and extended house will provide comfortable and spacious accommodation for his family. Also, more importantly, they will reduce their coal consumption and that will contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

This is 45-year-old Ratidzai from Harare. She is married and has two children. She also cares for two other dependents. Ratidzai runs a sewing business, producing seat covers and bed spreads.

She belongs to \u201cRose Lom Group\u201d and she is pictured with her hand raised. She is also the featured borrower of the group. Nenglhing subjugates all the challenges one can endure. She has seven kids and lives with her aged in-laws. Her husband earns a living as a sweeper in a military camp with a small regular monthly income.  To manage the family finances with only her husband's income was a big challenge. Debts were piling up while she was trying to look after the kids and the in-laws. School fees, medicinal cost for the in-laws and household maintenance expenses were all borne by only her husband income.\r\n\r\nNenglhing started raising piglets and slowly developed her piglet-selling business.  She is making rapid progress in her business. She usually travels across the neighboring provinces in the state and purchases piglets. The piglets are then sold in her village and the neighboring villages at a profit. She said, since each house raises pigs, selling piglets is not complicated and instead entices her to do better.  The most challenging part of her business is transportation. The public transport is the most convenient option but the passengers sometimes complain. In order not to disturb others, a private vehicle is hired to transport the piglets. The cost is high but that is the only option left for the piglet transportation. She keeps them in the pigsty at the back of her house and does the selling.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband work side by side to manage the household expenses.  With her financial assistance, the family is now able to pay back the previous debts.  She wants all of her seven kids to get an education because she was deprived of a good education in her childhood days. The family financial conditions did not allow her to pursue further studies and she ended up with a mere primary education.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more piglets to sell and meet the demands of her customers. She is also planning to provide her customers with a credit facility if she can successfully avail the loan.  She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the undeniable support and love. She wishes them great success and prosperity. The rest of the group members are engaged in piggery, weaving and vegetable-selling businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1365217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more piglets to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-06-04T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-04T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenglhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaineichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahjalam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalpi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-06T18:57:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":568434,"name":"Ngnonbouwo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ngnonbouwo est un de 57ans, mari\u00e9 p\u00e8re de famille .Il a un petit secr\u00e9tariat, sa client\u00e8le devient de plus en plus nombreuse alors il sollicite un cr\u00e9dit pour agrandir sa structure en ajoutant les ordinateurs et une imprimante pour pouvoir la satisfaire et augmenter sa production.

Marina is buying clothes from the big market in the capital city at the wholesale price, brings it to her district and sells with the price markup among the villagers.\r\n \r\nMarina requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Marina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

He has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. He works as a gardener and his father is a driver, and they both earn a small monthly income. There is hardly enough on food for the family. According to Credo estimates the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKonstantine is requesting a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides start-up and re-startup credits with easy terms to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

The population works in animal husbandry, farming and in the city doing different jobs. \r\n\r\nThe members are very happy women who fight and work every day to improve the economic situation of their homes and to give their children a better future. \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Mar\u00eda Juana. She is asking for her second loan next to her friends and members of the communal bank Divino Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas. She likes this type of loan a lot since it improves her economy. \r\n\r\nShe gets together with her friends to talk and to get away from the daily work routine. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Juana  is 39, married and has 4 children aged 15, 12, 10 and 8. Her first two children are studying in school and her youngest two study at a small local school. \r\n\r\nHer husband works as a day laborer. They do not have their own home which is why they live with her in-laws in their own area of the house. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Juana spends most of her time at home but helps the household economy by raising chickens which she keeps in sheds. She also plants vegetables which she sells in her community or in the city. \r\n\r\nShe will use the new loan to buy chickens, chicken feed and seeds. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to build a bigger shed for her animals. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5350,"image":{"id":1361909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens, chicken feed and seeds.

His small retail business is doing well, thanks to Kalidou's warm welcome, to his professional experience and to the fact that he has managed to build a good customer base over time.  However, with an increasing number of customers, Kalidou can no longer meet demand because his capital is so small that he has to buy in retail quantities.\r\n\r\nKalidou is requesting this loan in order to boost his small business and diversify his merchandise (rice, salt, mineral water, boxes of sugar, snacks...) which will help him to increase his profit margin.

Rusudan requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time, because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nRusudan works as a waitress at local restaurant and she gets a small monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs in the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nRusudan requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Rusudan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit Rusudan will begin a clothing trade. She plans to purchase clothing from wholesalers and then resell at higher prices. After starting a business, she will be able to increase the income of her family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of her children.

The harvested products and dairy products are sold at the local markets.\r\n\r\nZurab requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Zurab has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Zurab will open a caf\u00e9. He has a space at the local board building. He plans to do a small renovation, purchase all the needed equipment and products, and open a caf\u00e9. As there are a lot of people working in this building and also a lot of locals going there for civil issues, Zurab will have a good number of clients. He will earn a good profit and try to develop his business more. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She purchases clothes from different areas and sells them in the main market at profitable rates. Nighat is a responsible mother of four children. Her husband makes his living as a daily worker whose income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family members. Her contribution to the family income is playing a vital role in fulfilling the needs of the family members. To cope with the increasing demand during the summer season, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a variety of clothes in different colors. She hopes to get an increase in her net income and wishes to spend a part of the profits on the improvement of her house. She is very thankful to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1365370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

fulfilling her dream of achieving a better life for her and her family. Currently, Adwowa is an entrepreneur. She sells palm kennel oil in Putubiw (near Cape Coast). \r\n\r\nHer business enterprise has grown substantially since she began 3 years ago.

province, Mao is 34 years old and married. She has four children, two of whom are dependent on her and still in school. To make a living, she has been working as a rice farmer on two hectares of farmland. Her husband complements the income by working for others for a fee.

Cambodia. He is married and has four children, two of whom are in school. For the last 22 years, Mao has been in farming rice, planting cassava, and working as a construction worker to support his family. Sometimes, he works for others for a fee in order to add up more income. The current business earns him about 30,000 Cambodian riels (KHR) per day to meet the family's needs. \r\n \r\nMao is just with VisionFund this cycle.

She lives in the small village of Khobi District with her wife and two children, who go to school. Irma requested loans from local financial institutions several times for her family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is actively involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of land where they grow mandarin trees, nut trees, and bay trees. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price. In addition, Irma works as a teacher at the local school. It pays hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Irma has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith her credit, Irma will purchase a milking cow and will renovate shed for the cow. She will produce cheese for selling and will be able to increase her income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Her loan request was rejected every time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milking cow, whose milk is used in making cheese products. They sell cheese at local markets. Besides this, her husband works as an electrician and gets a small income. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the poor subsistence category. \r\n\r\nMaka requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Maka has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of a business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Maka will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built, she will be able to sow vegetables there. The harvested vegetables will be sold at local markets at a good price. This will increase the income of their family.

her dream of achieving a better life for her and her family. Currently, Ekua is an entrepreneur. She sells doughnuts in Putubiw (near Cape Coast). Her business enterprise has grown substantially since she began 7 years ago.

She specializes in selling salted fish in Putubiw (near Cape Coast). She has been involved in this enterprise for 10 years. Efua is married and has 4 children. Her husband works as a farmer.

He lives in a small village in the Chokhatauri District with his mother, Rusudan. Manuchar has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up. However, he has not had success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family comes from their agricultural activities. Specifically, they have two milking cows, five calves, a pig and piglets. Rusudan produces cheese products and sells them at the local markets. They have 0.6 hectares of agricultural land, where 500 nut trees are grown. They sell 400 to 500 kg of nuts seasonally and at a good price. It is hardly enough to put food on the table for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nManuchar has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Manuchar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up credit with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan, Manuchar will purchase a tractor. This will enable him to receive orders to transport wood, thereby increasing the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She lives alone in Shalauri village in the Telavi district. Venera requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Venera owns a small plot of agricultural land where maize is grown. The harvested product is sold at the local market. Her additional income is a monthly pension. \r\n\r\nVenera requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Venera will purchase a small stock of groceries.

He lives in Senaki District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law, an infant granddaughter and his mother. His mother is provided with a retirement pension. Malkhaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMalkhaz has an auto workshop, where he works as an artisan and repairs damaged cars. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMalkhaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

Corn, apples, bananas etc. are grown there. Ines lives with her parents who, because they are poor, could only afford to send her to school up to grade five of high school. She would have liked to study cookery.\r\n\r\nInes works as a day laborer on a nearby farm. She works about nine hours a day, and in addition she raises and sells guinea pigs, a business she started on her own initiative with her savings. The latter brings in  extra income with which she helps her parents pay for household expenses.

","en":"Komron is 21 years old. He is single and lives with his parents. Komron was a good student in secondary school, but, since he grew up in a low-income family, it wasn\u2019t possible for him to go the university and continue his studies. At present, Komron works as a taxi driver. He transports passengers across the city. Since he lives in a large city, and many people here use taxis, his business is growing fast.

The two businesses enable him to earn approximately $210 US per month which he uses towards his family's expenses.  He recently happened to visit Visionary Empowerment Programme and was introduced to the available solar lamps and their advantages.  He has opted to change his business from electronics to solar lamps, and believes this will double his profits since his customers have been frequently complaining of high electricity bills and occasional power shortages.  \n\nVEP advanced this loan to George so he could purchase ten PowaPack 5w home devices, each of which can be used to light four rooms, power a radio and also charge a mobile phone.  With this solar package, his customers will be able to save on their monthly electricity bills.  Those without electricity can replace their kerosene lamps with cleaner solar lamps which are less costly than installing electricity.  By selling these lamps, he expects to make profits of around $23 per lamp.  Combined with the income from his M-Pesa business, this will put him in a position to repay the loan in 12 months and also reinvest some money into his business for

They have been VEP members since last year and have each benefitted from a number of loans for self development.  All of them are mothers with school-age children and their concern is financial security to ensure quality education for their children.\nThey live in Kiambu County in central Kenya, and their core business has been the sale of secondhand clothing at a local market. \n\nCurrently, they would like to expand their business by venturing into green energy products, specifically energy saving Jikos, that are beneficial to the environment and also income generating.  Through their network at the grassroots level, they can reach many women and create more awareness about the usage of efficient cookstoves.  They will also be able to transform their environment by reducing deforestation. \n\nVEP has advanced them a loan to purchase 20 Firewood Jikos each, totalling to 180 Jikos.  Each Jiko costs about $32 US and will be sold at $39 making a profit of about $8 per Jiko.  With this profit and income from the clothing business, the ladies can be self employed and financially stable.  Their income will be used to repay the loan and some profits will be ploughed back into the business to ensure sustainability.\n\nTheir dream is be the central point of sale for renewable energy in their region, and they hope to incorporate solars into their business in future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5825,"image":{"id":1365464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy

is a mother of three living in central Kenya.  All of her children are in primary school and depend on her for all their needs.  To care for them, she practices farming as her source of income.  She has five dairy cows, three of which she milks to get approximately 30 liters of milk that she sells to a local hotel for 25 US cents per liter.  She also rears pigs which she is able to sell after their maturity period of 6 months at about $470 US per pig, making a profit margin of around $82.  Currently she has 3 piglets to be sold in December.  \n\nIncome from her farming work is shared among her many responsibilities, and the money is often not enough to cover her needs.  To save on some of her expenses, VEP officials advised her to have a biodigester installed to cut down on the cost of fuel.  With a biodigester she would have sufficient fuel for cooking and lighting, hence replacing her kerosene lantern with clean, free energy.  This will allow her to save the money previously spent on charcoal and firewood and use it to finance other needs.\n\nEvery month, Mary spends at least $35 US on kerosene and $17.50 US on charcoal, without accounting for the long hours spent walking to the forest every week to collect firewood.  All of this will be saved by having a biodigester at her homestead.  Additionally, with the organic bioslurry from the biodigester, she can practice organic agriculture through composting and this will also save her from buying fertilizers.  Her crop yield will surely increase and never will she suffer from food insecurity.  In fact, her harvest will increase and enable her to sell some crops to create a new channel of income.\n\nWith this in mind, VEP has financed her this loan to be repaid in 24 months, and confidently believe it will be repaid promptly as her savings increase.\n\n

He intends to use the loan to buy some calves to fatten up.  He\u2019s been working in animal husbandry for some time and some time ago his father gave him a small parcel of grassland apt for raising these animals.  \r\n\r\nHe now has two calves and wants to buy more to put his land to maximum use.  He\u2019s thinking about increasing the size of his herd so that in time he can sell the animals at a very good price and generate well-being for his family while at the same time continuing to buy more animals so he can improve himself.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan he\u2019s gotten from Fudecosur.  He\u2019s had no previous loans from state banks and Fudecosur has offered the best terms and a much lower interest rate.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":683.33,"image":{"id":1364265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Santa Rosa, Brunka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2013-06-05T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-05T18:30:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jordy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":168516.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579564348},{"amount":341.66,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":168516.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557758}],"funded_date":"2013-06-12T02:00:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":568542,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Marie.

She also loves fashion. Combine those loves with a deep desire to be her own boss and to determine her own destiny, and what you get is Sweet Peas, a unique boutique for children\u2019s clothing in Fultondale, a Birmingham suburb. \r\n\r\n\u201cI enjoy shopping for little girl's clothing,\u201d Marissa said. \u201cI have a little boy, but when my niece was born, it was like a whole new world with all the cute clothes for the little girls. I enjoy shopping for her. When I decided I wanted to start my own business, I wanted to do something for children.\u201d\r\n\r\nMarissa works for a benefits company, and was able to save money to secure a lease for a commercial space and get initial inventory. She opened Sweet Peas in March 2013, filling the store with hand-made dresses and unique designs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that the clothes I sell are formal, more vintage or old fashioned, like capri pants with ruffles on the bottom, high quality but not formal,\u201d Marissa said. \u201cI have some items for people who like leggings with tunics. We have clothes for infants up to size 20 in girls and boys for the big kids.\u201d\r\n\r\nMarissa didn\u2019t want to get into debt. But she needed a sign and some working capital for advertising, inventory, or whatever else came up as she got her business started. She also wanted to build her business credit to prepare for the possible expansion of her business in the future. She consulted a friend, who told her to look into Accion Texas Inc. Marissa is using her $5,450 loan to buy a store-front sign and inventory. She also plans to hire a web designer to help her build a website.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, Marissa continues to work her full-time job and entrusts the store to her aunt, who handles sales until Marissa can get to the store in the evening and on the weekends. Marissa dreams of expanding and opening several stores in Alabama and possibly outside of the state. But for the moment, as a start-up business, her goal is to generate enough sales so she can work full-time on the store.  \r\n\r\n\u201cBeing a business owner vs. being an employee, I can make decisions and say this is something that I think will be good for the company and make things happen, so it\u2019s great,\u201d Marissa said. \u201cIt is also very stressful, because you have to make sure you\u2019re making the right decisions. And even when the sales aren\u2019t there, you still have to pay your lease and buy the inventory. So it\u2019s hard. But I think it\u2019s better to be a business owner.\u201d\r\n\r\nMarissa said though her business is new, she is confident that her store concept will take off because Sweet Peas is filling a need.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn my area, we don\u2019t have any children\u2019s boutiques,\u201d Marissa said. \u201cI really wanted to do something having to do with children, because there just aren\u2019t enough things here for them.\u201d"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1365641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase inventory and a store sign.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Fultondale, Alabama","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-06-05T18:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-05T18:40:11Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":561805,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel is a driver\/sprayer located at Santrokofi, Hohoe.
