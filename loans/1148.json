She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan along her husband, a daughter and a son. Her husband is a government employee but his income is insufficient to pay all of his household expenses. Both of her children are studying in government schools. Aliya is a beautician by profession and has been operating her own beauty salon since 2010. Currently her stock of supplies is very low, which is why she is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to buy more beauty products like facial creams, lipstick, scrubs, makeup kits, hair colors and other products. She would also like to buy new chairs for her salon. She will use the profits she earns to repay this loan and pay her children's school fees. Her dream is to live a happy, healthy and peaceful life with her family. She is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their support.

I didn't have a place for my salon, but while I studied my husband and I worked very hard to build the shop, gathering bottles in the streets and selling them. With the income from that we bought material for building the shop. Bit by bit we finished it. The dyes, the combs, the brushes, the treatments, and other things, we bought thanks to loans from Vision Fund and Kiva; I am very grateful for this\".\nYola is requesting this loan for the purchase of dyes, treatments, peroxides, shampoo, brushes, etc. She loves working at her beauty parlour. She has a lot of clientele. She used to serve anyone, but now only works by appointment. Yola is very happy and is always in a very good mood. Her customers love her. Above all, she is very hard-working and responsible with her work. \nYola does not have any problems with her business.

All of them are very hard-working people.  Hilaria is part of the Sorpresa group.  She is 44 years old, and she has been married to Juan for 26 years.  Together they make up a family with six children, two of whom are still dependent upon them.\n\nHilaria is a very hard-working person.  She says that she has been raising, fattening, and selling sheep for 27 years.  She says that she started this business activity because when she was little her parents taught her how to care for these little animals.  When she got married to Juan she had to start her own business in order to be able to help with the household expenses and her children\u2019s education because often Juan\u2019s work did not cover the household expenses.  Somehow, Hilaria had to help him.  She says, \u201cThe truth is that I really liked helping my husband in this way because it allowed me to be with my children and not neglect them\u201d.  \n\nThis time she is requesting the loan to buy more lambs and fodder, which will serve to feed her animals.  For years her profits were very good, but she is now facing competition that she has in her own community.  Most of her neighbors raise lambs.  Therefore, it is more complicated when it is time to sell.  People don\u2019t want to pay the price they have normally been paying for lambs.

","en":"Bakhtiyor is a resident of the city of Qurgan-Tube.  He is 51 years old, married, and the father of two adult children, a daughter and a son, who now live independently.

Many farmers in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives, and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.  \r\n\r\nChristine is married, and has five children. She and her husband have been farming for five years, and are currently growing cashew nuts on their land. Christine is excited to start beekeeping because it is a good opportunity to earn income, especially since the dedicated service of the Hive Technicians means that she can focus on her farming. \r\n\r\nThis is Christine's first loan, and she plans to use the income generated by her beehives to start a poultry project.

Muhabbat loves her children very much and always tries to spend time with them, even though she works and does not have much time. Muhabbat was born and grew up in Spitamen Region, in the family of white-collar workers. After finishing secondary school, Muhabbat has enrolled in a Teacher\u2019s College. After finishing college, she used to work as a grammar school teacjer. She really enjoyed her profession. But thingshas turned out in such a way that her salary alone was not enough to support her family. Because of this, in 2003 she started working as a vendor at the regional clothing market. Muhabbat sells men\u2019s clothing as there is good demand for it. Muhabbat has an optimistic attitude, does not let minor issues get her down, and always encourages others, spreading positive energy. During the summer season, Muhabbat would like to expand her selection, and she needs funds. This is why she applied to Arvand for a loan. Muhabbat would like to use her loan to stock up on men\u2019s clothing.\r\nMuhabbat thanks Arvand in advance for its important support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1365831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Both he and his wife have been farming for twenty-three years, and are currently growing maize and mangoes on their land. George is looking forward to working with Honey Care because they give \"efficient and personalized service.\" He is also excited to start beekeeping because it will give him a source of natural honey for medicinal use.\r\n\r\nThis is George's first loan, and he plans to use the income generated from his beehives to start goat farming.

The highest education he ever got was elementary school because his parents could not afford more than that, causing a great handicap throughout his life. He lives with his wife and his two children who are under 18. His wife works in the farms next to their house from sunrise till dusk. Nimer was previously working as a blacksmith, but his advancing age and his deteriorating health condition forced him to resign and to look for another means of earning income. This is how he ended up selling coffee and tea from a mobile machine, which he moves every day from one corner of the village to the other. He asked for Al Majmoua to provide a loan that would enable him to buy a new coffee maker machine that would facilitate his work. His ambition for the future is to open up his own coffee store so that he would not have to move around the

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Rezan is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nRezan has four years of experience with her small, home-based sewing and tailoring business. She has been able to attract clients with quality works on dresses for women and children as well as on small fabric household items. In addition to continuing producing quality works, she would like to improve her work environment, making it both nicer for herself as she works and for her clients as they visit for fittings. Rezan is requesting a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq, which she will use to renovate her work area. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor and unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Todo el proceso que he narrado implic\u00f3 un gasto excesivo para mi familia. Todav\u00eda necesito  materiales, medicinas, y chequeos m\u00e9dicos para mi condici\u00f3n. La condici\u00f3n financiera de la familia ya no soporta los gastos de mi educaci\u00f3n universitaria. Es por ello que apelo de su ayuda en la manera de lo posible para encontrar una forma de costear mis estudios. Terminar mi carrera exitosamente y graduarme con honores es un sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s que deseo ver cumplido, con la ayuda de Dios y mientras haya vida en m\u00ed seguir\u00e9 luchando hasta verlo alcanzado. ","en":"Crisley is a young medical school student, who is requesting an education loan to pay her school's tuition.  This is her story:\n\nMy name is Crisley and I am a young medical student in Santo Domingo. Three years ago it seemed like a distant dream to study one day due to the circumstances that changed my life and that of my family. I was diagnosed in 2009 with a chronic disease. I was admitted to the hospital several times and I was hospitalized for more than six months followed by surgery. Despite a few limitations, my condition has not stopped me completely. I attend university, I am part of a dance group, I volunteer with the Red Cross, and whenever I can I provide moral support for other people like me. \n\nI am very clear on my purpose in life and the goals I want to achieve. This includes becoming a great doctor of gastroenterology. I truly believe that everything in life happens for a reason and maybe this was all just the push I needed to know that my place is where I can serve, help, and turn my experiences into something positive in the life of another that has health problems similar to mine. \n\nI live with my parents and brother who is in secondary school. The entire process I just explained was excessively costly for my family. I still need things, medicines, and medical visits due to my condition. My family's financial situation can no longer support my university expenses. That is why I am requesting help in whatever manner possible to find a way to pay for my studies. Successfully completing my degree and graduating with honors is another dream I hope to achieve with the help of God. While there is still life in me I will continue striving to reach it.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1366215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \n\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have three milking cows, two calves and a pig. Nana produces cheese products for selling. Besides, they have a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees, bay trees and maize are grown. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price, but it is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \n\nNana requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Nana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \n\nWith her credit, Nana will begin trading fruits and vegetables. She plans to purchase fruits and vegetables at wholesale prices. Nana's son will transport them to buy at higher prices. This will increase their income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

A macquiladora is a manufacturing operation in a free-trade zone in Mexico where factories import material and equipment on a duty-free and tariff-free basis.  Currently, there are roughly 3000 macquiladoras with over 1.3 million Mexican workers.  \r\n\r\nAs a Mexican native from Juarez, Mexico, Dr. Jesus became a naturalized citizen of the United States and began his dream of owning his own business, Jarvam, LLC, and teaching at a local university.  His Ph.D. in systems engineering gives him the necessary skills and talent to manufacture his POS cash registers using radio frequency identification or RFID.  RFID is a wireless non-contact use of radio frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data.  The main goal for these machines he creates is to manage and control inventory within the macquiladoras.  \r\n\r\nDr. Jesus came to Accion Texas Inc. when a community partner referred him.  He applied for a loan and received approval shortly after his application process was finished.  The $5,450 loan he received has been used to purchase components to manufacture the register, pay his one employee, create a working capital fund for his business, and begin the first steps to bring his machine and system into the United States market.  His ultimate goal is to offer his product in El Paso, Texas, and branch out to other cities and states.  \u201cWithout the Accion loan, I would not be able to offer the product in the United States,\u201d says Dr. Jesus.\r\n\r\nFor now, Dr. Jesus will continue to develop advanced software for his machine, continue to teach, and market his product to local businesses here in the United States."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1365659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase components to manufacture the register, pay his one employee, create a working capital fund for his business, and begin the first steps to bring his machine and system into the United States market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"El Paso, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-06-06T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-06T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":568815,"name":"Olivier","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olivier is 33 years old.

","en":"Sharof is a cheerful man, 55 years of age.  He is married and is a father to six children.  Sharof and his wife live in harmony and try to raise their children to be good people.  His two older sons already have their own families.  Sharof and his wife are very happy to raise their grandchildren.  To earn a living, Sharof runs his own business.  For the last two years, he has sold fruits and vegetables.  Previously, he worked in farming but then he decided to sell his own crops.  He uses his own vehicle to transport his crops to a market in the city to sell.  At the market he also buys other types of fruits and vegetables to sell back in his village.  This business brings in consistent income.  Now, Sharof wants to expand and build a small counter near his home where his wife will sell different types of fruits and vegetables.  For this reason he wants to take out a loan to buy a large assortment of fruits and vegetables.  For this loan, he turned to Arvand and he hopes for a positive outcome.

This urban parish is situated only 10 minutes from the city of Portoviejo, capital of the Manabi province.  Here, members of the Mar\u00eda Asunci\u00f3n community bank meet every two weeks.\n\nIn this place lives Herminda, who is 76 years old.  She is married, and from this marriage she has 9 children, all of whom are adults.  One daughter, who is separated, lives with her.  Her husband no longer works due to illness.\n\nShe is requesting the loan to invest it in a locksmith's workshop that they have in their house with one of their children.  Her husband had this business, but had to give it up due to illness, and now her son is responsible for the work and she receives part of the earnings.  It is with this that she and her husband get ahead.\n\nIn the workshop, they do a lot of work with metal, aluminum and glass.  They build doors, windows, structures and various other things.

She has been running this business since 2004. She works at the business 8 hours a day and 7 days per week.  Her major challenge is insufficient capital to run her business. \r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy more cigarettes, soap, milk, gari and sugar for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to repay her loans and pay her children\u2019s school fees. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to become a wholesaler in the fish business.

They have four adult children who live in the city and are studying so they can have a better future. Victor is a farmer and grows potatoes, corn and peas on his land. He says that each day is a sacrifice, because he must look after his small farm without his children and send them money in the city. He says he must work along with his wife to help his children get ahead. He sells the products he harvests to obtain good profits. Victor says, \u201cI have enough to live on, because here if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat\u201d. He also says that he knows that you make more money during the harvest season.\r\n\r\nVictor likes being a farmer because it is all he has learned since he was a child. Moreover, he says he learned how to put what he was learning into practice so that he could provide for his family. He has many plans for the future, which include raising guinea pigs, because he says the meat of these animals sells at a good price and is in demand because it is delicious.\r\n\r\nThis is Victor\u2019s second loan with Kiva. He is grateful for the support he has received, because it has allowed him to invest in his fields. He promises to make his payments on time. He will use the 3000 PEN to buy organic fertilizer for his fields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1365052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer for his fields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-06T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-06T21:40:04Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":323.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":340.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":350.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":365.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":382.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":394.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":415.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":427.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.61},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.43,"local_amount":320.25,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":321.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975818},{"amount":123.57,"local_amount":337,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":338.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997085},{"amount":126.51,"local_amount":345.04,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":346.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864555},{"amount":523.44,"local_amount":1427.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1432.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352923},{"amount":133.44,"local_amount":363.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":365.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904690},{"amount":75.61,"local_amount":206.23,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":206.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450597903}],"funded_date":"2013-06-07T08:06:35Z","paid_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":568854,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 26 years old and an industrious gentleman, newly married to Mary.

My father-in-law started the business and then sold it to me six years ago when I married his daughter.  I will use this loan to buy more groceries, as I believe that by having more variety, I will be able to increase sales.  I consider myself credit worthy because I always pay my debts on time.

They are working with one of the organization's regional offices in Villa Exaltaci\u00f3n. The group is made up of eight members and is headed by a Board of Directors. Luisa is the President of the Board. The members of the communal bank run a variety of businesses, including clothing sales, trouser sales, a grocery store, sales of powdered dyes, cosmetics sales, sales of sundry items, and wood carving.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit small micro-businesses where Luisa is a member. She says that this is her eighth loan cycle with Pro Mujer. She joined the group at the invitation of a consultant from the institution, who came to visit her at her home. Currently, Luisa has a business running a neighbourhood convenience store. She began this business when she saw what was needed in her area.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is taking out is to increase her stock (to buy rice, sugar, oil, etc.) which she will acquire at fairs in the city of El Alto and later set up in her place of business. This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her household as best as she can, since she is single and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she liked about Pro Mujer, she

He lives with his wife Doris, with whom he has two children. He looks after his children in the house he acquired 17 years ago. His days are exhausting - he works with a water company and gets paid for his transportation services on a monthly basis. He reports that he greatly enjoys this work, because it's quieter. In his previous occupations he was self-employed and used to transport merchandise to different cities of the country. Now that he has this contract, he feels good. \"The whole van is under contract. They pay me two wages, one for my van and one for my driving services. It's profitable and I don't travel to other cities\", he says.

is 50 years old, single, and lives in Nimba County, in Liberia.  Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore.  The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.  As a result, many people on business pass through the area, bringing lots of trade.  It is also the second most populous area in Liberia.\r\n \r\nAmeamata has had a shop for some time, where she sells clothes.  She works at her business nine hours per day.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is having too few goods in her shop.  With the proceeds from the loan, she wants to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\nShe went to school and finished grade 12.  Her fiancee is a wood seller.  She has a 27-year-old child.  Ameamata describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  She is proud of her business, because she earns money every day, for her expenses.  She wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

is 34 years old, single, and lives in Nimba County, in Liberia.  Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore.  The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.  As a result, many people on business pass through the area, bringing lots of trade.  It is also the second most populous area in Liberia.\r\n \r\nPrecelia has had a shop for some time past, where she sells rubber dishes such as plates, cups, and bowls.  She works at her business 10 hours per day.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is having too few goods in her shop.  With the proceeds from the loan, she wants to buy more inventory.\r\n\r\nShe went to school and finished grade 12.  Her fiancee is a wood seller.  She has six children, aged between 6 and 17 years.  She describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  Precelia is proud of her business, because she earns money every day, for her expenses.  She wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

His original hometown of London, England had been his address before moving to Texas.  With five years of experience, his start-up business, Prestigious Movers, has been in business for the past 10 months with one full-time employee. \r\n \r\nHe and his employee spend the days moving furniture for customers using the best customer service and professionalism during each job.  Serving the Houston area, the state of Texas, and beyond \u2013 their reach has no borders.  Customers can expect a flat rate charge depending on the amount of furniture being moved and time it takes to do so.  Martin stresses his competitive prices that are both reasonable and fair. \r\n \r\nOther services provided by Martin and his company include removal of goods, wrapping delicates, and picking up ordered furniture for his customers.  \r\n\r\nMartin came to Accion Texas Inc. when a friend informed him about the organization that assists the Houston community with capital for their companies.  Martin was intrigued due to the fact that he was spending $400 a month in rental fees for delivery trucks to move customers.

His wife previously worked as a cook at a military base but due to bad health, she quit her job and now stays at home looking after her niece. His two sons both work in Korea on employment contracts. His elder daughter has a position as a nurse at a hospital while his younger daughter works as a program director at a television entity. \r\n\r\nJargalsaikhan is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, he wants to make an extension and add insulation to his house as his house provides not enough space for the whole family and over the years, the house has deteriorated and in wintertime, it loses heat dramatically. Also, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and so contribute to the efforts against air pollution.
