But this business has saved his family and provides a very good profit. Additionally, Odil moonlights as a security guard. He tries to do everything so that his children lack for nothing. From his friends Odil knew that the organization Arvand makes loans and he wrote to apply. He wants to buy cattle and increase his herd. He very much hopes that Arvand will help him and provide financial support.

","en":"Abdujalil is a cheerful 64-year-old man. He is married and has only one child. He and his wife have dedicated their lives to their son. Now, their son lives with his own family not far from them. Abdujalil is also very happy to raise his three grandchildren. Because they live in a small village, they are engaged in farming in order to have a stable income to live on. Abdujalil has a small plot of land on which he grows grain.  His son helps him with the business. They also have a small quantity of cattle, which they raise in order to sell later on. His wife helps Abdujalil with farming and raising livestock. Raising and selling cattle supplements their income. Now, Abdujalil wants to increase the yield of his grain harvest and receive additional income. He needs financial means in order to purchase a larger quantity of seeds to plant. Because of this, he has turned to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to purchase seeds necessary to plant grain.  He hopes to receive your support and thanks you in advance.

The area boasts one of the best standards of living in the county with affordable rents, good roads, access to water and lots of transportation options. She is a married with six children between 22 and 16 years old, who are living at home with her. Only three are currently attending school. The last grade she finished before getting to business is second grade. For the past 10 years, she has been selling pepper, bitter ball, okra, etc in the local market. She started this business with money given to her by her husband and she enjoys her business because the business gives her more money.  She sells six days a week, from 7 am to 6 pm, and most of the time she uses a shared taxi to get her goods to her shop. She is requesting a loan to purchase more inventories for her business. Her plan is to build a house and educate her

She believes that this is a good option for a family business because bread is a product that is always in demand, regardless of the time of year or other circumstances. Thus, Mohbegim has already built an oven in her yard and has procured necessary accessories. Now, she must obtain permits from the local authorities and purchase the raw materials for producing flat bread. In order to achieve her goal, she has applied for a loan. Her son, daughter and son-in-law will help her with the business. In addition, she will also hire two workers. Mohbegim plans to produce 1,500 flat breads per day. With the help of this business, she would increase her family's income and her family's living conditions would

Fueron ellos los que le ense\u00f1aron a trabajar la tierra (cultivo de caf\u00e9) desde muy peque\u00f1a y en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su pareja lo practica hace m\u00e1s de 6 a\u00f1os ya que este rubro es el \u00fanico medio de ingreso para sus padres y actualmente para su familia. Las tierras que ella en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su pareja cultivan son propias gracias a una herencia por parte de sus padres las cuales est\u00e1n ubicadas a 1.5 kil\u00f3metros de distancia de su casa de habitaci\u00f3n.\n\nDominga solicita ayuda para la compra de abono, foliares y fertilizantes para sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 los cuales ayudaran a proteger la planta y fortalecer las ra\u00edces y el grano en su totalidad. \n\nSus deseos y sue\u00f1os en primer lugar es ver crecer a sus hijos con una carrera profesional a nivel universitario para que puedan heredar la tierra que hoy en d\u00eda sus padres trabajan formando un patrimonio para ellos. Sus metas son comprar un pedazo m\u00e1s de tierra para poder cultivar m\u00e1s producto en variedad y ofrecer a sus compradores locales e intermediarios. \n","en":"Dominga is 28 years old and lives with her partner and two children. She has a fighting and enterprising spirit. She went to primary school up to the third grade, but she was not able to finish because her parents did not have enough economic resources. Her parents have been farmers all of their lives. They taught her how to work the land and grow coffee since she was very young. She has grown coffee with her partner now for six years, because this area of work is the only source of income for her parents and also at the moment for her family. The land she and her partner cultivate is their own, having inherited it from their parents. Their land is located 1.5 kilometers from the house where they live.\r\n\r\nDominga is requesting a loan to buy different types of fertilizer for her coffee crops. These fertilizers will help protect the plants and strengthen the roots and beans.\r\n\r\nDominga\u2019s principal dream is seeing her children grow up with professional careers from a university. She would like them to inherit the land that today their family works and that forms part of their inheritance. Her goal is to buy another piece of land to be able to grow a wider variety of products to offer to local buyers and intermediaries."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1365591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy different types of fertilizer for her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-06-08T10:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-08T10:20:01Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1250,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895289}],"funded_date":"2013-06-10T22:08:36Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":569631,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"De 31 anos de idade, agente de servi\u00e7o e pedreiro nas horas livres, vive maritalmente h\u00e1 10 anos em casa pr\u00f3pria com a sua fam\u00edlia.

She specializes in preparing and selling \u2018Kenkey\u2019 (a traditional Ghanaian dish made from corn dough and wrapped in banana leaves). She usually sells her \u2018Kenkey\u2019 in Effutuakwa (near Cape Coast). She has been involved in preparing and selling \u2018Kenkey\u2019 for 6 years. \r\n\r\nAbenaa is married and has 2 children. Her husband works as a farmer. The proceeds from her business normally go towards helping her husband cover the family\u2019s general expenses and paying their children\u2019s school fees.

He was married, but has been divorced from his wife for a long time. Uktam has two children that stayed to live with him after the divorce. Since then, he has had to raise and care for his children on his own. He loves them very much and does everything  so that they live in dignity. \r\n\r\nTo earn a living, he operates his own business. Because he lives in the countryside, he is mostly involved in animal husbandry. Uktam raises cattle and sells them in the market, and also sells milk from his cattle. This business provides him with a normal, stable income. Uktam also works in construction, but it is seasonal work that provides him additional income in the spring and the summer. Now, Uktam wants to increase his stock of cattle to earn more income from their subsequent sale. He applied to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to buy a cow. Uktam thanks Arvand in advance for their

After her husband learned the craft of pizza-making in the capital of Colombia, Bogot\u00e1, she learned it from him and later began to work together with him, until she was able to find a location to work independently. Today she makes and sells pizzas of many different flavors in this location.  She adjusts the pizzas to the tastes of her customers. Her larger goal is to have a big shop to reach and make sales to more consumers.  She dreams of earning more profits that would help her to offer her children the opportunity to continue studying and achieving great successes. Her return on investment today is no less than 7% and from this amount she projects her investments.

is a 47-year-old business woman from Liberia.

Kumba was unable to attend school, and today works in St. Paul, which is the oldest market in Liberia and known for fish because of its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb just outside Monrovia. It is one of the poorer areas of the country and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. Kumba works at a table where she has sold charcoal for the last 15 years. Her greatest challenge in life is the small income she earns. She is applying for this loan to buy more charcoal to sell to her customers. Her goal is to one day own a house.

St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia, which is known for fresh fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Freeport.  It is one of the poorer areas, and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing.\r\n \r\nLoretta completed 12th grade and is married.  Her husband is a barber.  She has three children between the ages of 14 and 9. Her three children are in school, and they all live at home.\r\n \r\nLoretta owns her own sales table, and she has sold cooking ingredients, like pepper, oil, and okra, for the past four years.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase similar goods.  On average, she works 10 hours per day at her business.  She started her business with money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by taxi.  She cites rainy seasons as her biggest business challenge.  Her favorite part of her business is the profit.  In the future, Loretta would like to build a shop.  She thanks you, in advance, for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1366780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is 39 years old and lives in the Liberian town of St. Paul, a suburb located outside of Monrovia.  It has one of the oldest markets in the country and is known for fresh fish because it is located by the ocean.  However, it is also one of the poorer areas of the country, and housing quality is often very low. Finda is married and the mother of four children who range in age from 23 to 15 years old. Her spouse works as teacher. Two of her children live at home and still attend school. Finda works at a table in the local market where she sells bread and soft drinks.  She has been in business for five years and works 12 hours a day. She is requesting this loan to buy more items to sell to her customers. One of the greatest challenges she faces in life is her low income. She transports her goods to market by taxi and started her business with money from her mother.  She is proud of her work because it allows her to earn an income. Her goal is to someday build a house. She would like to extend her thanks to Kiva lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

She describes herself as a working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in St. Paul.  St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia, which is known for fresh fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Freeport.  It is one of the poorer areas, and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing.\r\n\r\nChristina has a sales table, and she has been selling charcoal there, for the past three years.  She works ten hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is low income. She intends to use the loan to buy charcoal to resell at her table. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business, because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.

With the clearance sale from his previous business, he started making improvements to his house and purchasing tools to repair electronics.  He has been making his living in this business now for ten years, in addition to renting video games.

With this equipment he plans to offer improved service and continue to increase his sales. \r\n\r\nHe wishes to tell the Kiva financial backers that he is very grateful for the services provided by the Foundation and in addition he can continue improving his quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1365660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a photocopier","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-06-08T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-08T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor Eliecer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":133686},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":139138},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":142385},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":145707},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":149107},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":152586},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":156147},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159790},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":163518},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167334},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":171238},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":175234},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":179323},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":183507},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":187789},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":192170},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":196654},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":204687}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.24},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Dechert","image":null}},{"id":569280,"name":"Louise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Louise is a 44-year-old business woman from Liberia.

St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past Freeport. It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nMusu is 50 years old, married with four children. Only the 17-year-old child is in school and lives at home. For the past four years she has been operating a small shop where she sells soap, tissue, oil, etc. She says sometimes the buying is slow. Musu says she started this business by selling around in the communities with the little goods she could afford.  She learned this way of selling from her friends. She is requesting a loan to purchase more goods for her business. Her plan is to expand her business even

They are in school and live at home. For the past six years she has been operating a small shop where she sells rice, pepper, oil, etc. The rainy season is the problem that she faces. Yatta says she started this business by selling for her mother and learned this way of selling from her friends. She is requesting a loan to purchase more goods for her business.

She is single and has three children, between 12 and 6 years old. Her three children are currently attending school and live at home.  She completed school before starting her business.  She describes herself as a working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in St. Paul.  St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past Freeport.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nJosephine has a table business, which sells palm oil, rice, etc for the past 7 years.  She works ten hours at her business a day.  Her greatest challenge in business is the small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

They live in Nimba County in Liberia. Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore. The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea. As a result, many people on business pass through the area, bringing lots of trade. It is also the second most populous area in Liberia.\r\n\r\nAnnie has had a business for the past three years selling palm oil, starting this business with funds from her mother. She works at her business daily for around eight hours. She transports the goods to her business by pickup. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is a shortage of goods in her shop.\r\n\r\nAnnie has requested a loan to purchase more palm oil for her business. She describes herself as a hardworking woman. In the future, she hopes to own a house. She is proud of her business because she earns money every day to cover her expenses.\r\n\r\nAnnie wants to thank all of the lenders who support BRAC

In his spare time, he enjoys himself playing games like baseball with his kids. Unfortunately, because he didn't have the economic resources, he was not able to study for a degree and he had to work from a very early age.\r\nThanks to his spirit of excellence and his desire to succeed, he has a business selling merchandise such as men's and women's clothes: trousers, blouses, t-shirts, skirts, shorts, dresses, underwear, towels, nightwear. He works about 9 hours a day and he sells door to door, carrying a 30kg package of clothes. The goal of this loan is to supply his business by buying merchandise so that, in the not too distant future, he can get a better income. Miguel Ger\u00f3nimo is grateful for the help that the Kiva lenders offer to people who have scare resources and to poor countries such as Nicaragua so they can have dignified work. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":885197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to have business capital to buy and sell merchandise such as men's and women's clothes: trousers, blouses, t-shirts, skirts, shorts, dresses, underwear, towels, nightwear.

Her husband is a security guard. She has two children between the ages of 20 and 10, one of whom is in school. They all live at home.\r\n\r\nOn average, she works 10 hours a day at her business. She started her business with money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by bus. She cites high price of gasoline as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is that she makes more profits. In the future, she would like to own a house.\r\n\r\nDorothy has owned her shop selling cold water and soft drinks for the past 20 years.

Her previous loan was a big help in her business. She was able to buy more products and ingredients for her food stall. The loan also helped in the education of her children. She has been in her business for seven years already. She and her husband are continuously working to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nErnesa would like to apply for a 16,000 Philippine peso loan to purchase raw ingredients and supplies needed in her business. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to meet her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nErnesa dreams of expanding her business and hopes to have a good life for her family.

married. She has five children, two of whom are students in a local school. Since Kampong Cham is an area where cassava is one of the famous products, and the farmer can generate more income from this cash-crop, Sima also grows this crop on her 1 hectare of farmland. To supplement her income, she plants soybeans on a 1.5-hectare area. \r\n\r\nFor two years that she has been occupied in this business, she has been able to earn about 40,000 KHR (Cambodian riels) per day. Sima has been with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) for two times including this loan. After the successful loan, which she has completely repaid, she feels confident that she can upgrade her living conditions at a good pace.

Mar\u00eda's husband only works from time to time.\r\n\r\nWith her husband working so rarely and in order to earn a little money on her own and to get ahead, Mar\u00eda sells all types of clothing.  She goes out almost every day, either in the morning or afternoon but she does not have a fixed timetable.  Customers can pay on credit in weekly installments.  Mar\u00eda has been doing this work for eight years as it allows her to earn a little to support the household.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is going to use this loan to buy all types of clothes and school uniforms, which is what is selling best at the moment, with classes having just re-started after the holidays.  Mar\u00eda has been with the communal bank sing the very beginning and she likes the help that is provided though loans.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's dreams are to stay healthy and to move ahead in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1365746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes and uniforms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-06-09T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-09T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":740.53,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":92.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":281.26,"local_amount":277.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":281.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381704241},{"amount":187.51,"local_amount":185.14,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":187.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566665},{"amount":187.51,"local_amount":185.14,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":187.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815683},{"amount":93.72,"local_amount":92.54,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":93.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410965894}],"funded_date":"2013-06-09T12:04:15Z","paid_date":"2013-10-21T08:54:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":568880,"name":"Josefina Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gracias a su cr\u00e9dikiva anterior, Josefina compr\u00f3 mercancias variadas, como aceite, arroz, pl\u00e1tano, papel higienico, con lo que surti\u00f3 su negocio y por esa raz\u00f3n sus ventas se incrementaron.

She has three children and they help one another in managing their household while operating the business. At this time, Susan is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nSusan operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during the evening when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Susan also has a direct selling business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, as well as frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSusan hopes to expand her business and dreams of giving her children a good life and a good education.

Her mother has retired from work and gets a state pension. The apartment they live in has been deteriorating over the years and it needs some serious repair including installing vacuum insulated windows and hardwood floors, and insulating walls with fiberglass and foam.

To tackle financial hardships, she grows cassava on two hectares area, and her husband works at a construction site to supplement the family income. She has been with this business for several years and is able to earn about 20,800 KHR per day. This is the second microloan for Sros with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

This is 47-year-old Constance from Harare. She is married with five children and two are attending school. Constance is in the poultry business, selling chickens. The business has been in operation for two years. She says the main challenges she faces are competition from other sellers and chicks dying due to cold weather. Constance has requested a loan of $500 to buy chicks and stock feeds. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to send her children to good schools and university and also improve the family's quality of life. In the future Constance plans to rear broilers (chickens bred for meat) at a capacity of 10,000 birds."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1366551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicks and stock feeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Machipisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":184,"posted_date":"2013-06-09T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-09T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Constance","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Letwin E","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyasha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chiedza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":382.15},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":396.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":409.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":424.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":436.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":450.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":409.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":424.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":436.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":382.15,"local_amount":382.15,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":382.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390623025},{"amount":396.95,"local_amount":396.95,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-03T08:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":396.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399867213},{"amount":409.65,"local_amount":409.65,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":409.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410355782},{"amount":424.15,"local_amount":424.15,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":424.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420275036},{"amount":436.4,"local_amount":436.4,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-26T09:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":436.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430093507},{"amount":450.7,"local_amount":450.7,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":450.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440205392}],"funded_date":"2013-06-13T15:03:54Z","paid_date":"2014-01-19T10:05:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hannah Piedt","image":null}}]}
