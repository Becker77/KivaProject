She lives with her two children and a grand-daughter, and is also raising her two nephews. Her brother died in 2007 and Altantsetseg took in his children, ages 11 and 13 years. \r\n\r\nFor the past several years, she has run a little bookstand that she moves from place to place depending where people are. She has sold books at the Naadam field, as well as the children\u2019s park. She also sells at bus stops. Last fall her son Turbat (who is 25) built her a little store from which to sell her books. With a loan, Altantsetseg wants to buy writing instruments, like pens and pencils, so that she can sell them along with the books to make a little more money. Because her husband died several years ago, the family depends on her little shop. \r\n\r\nAltantsetseg is a little deaf but that doesn\u2019t affect her in any way.  She is a very intelligent and clever person. She lives for those she provides for and her goal in life is to raise them to be good people.

Nusula is 45 years old and she is a mother to six children. She says she joined this business with the persuasion of close friends. Before that, she was involved in a food sales business. The ten years have been years where she has not only learnt the fundamentals of doing business, but also learnt the ways and means of making it profitable and successful.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Lugazi is near Lake Victoria is an advantage in her business in that she does not have to spend much in transport costs. The fact that fish sells highly on the markets in Lugazi and the surrounding towns is also another merit. Her biggest challenge, however, is the tight competition manifest in this trade.

His brother has recently returned from the army and is also unemployed for the moment.\r\n\r\nEdgar has decided to add to his number of animals. This addition will help him to grow his farming business. He has requested a 1,000,000 AMD loan to buy a cow and purchase pig fodder. Adding a cow will help develop the business and add to the family's milk production. \r\n\r\nEdgar is a second-level client in Nor Horizon and has never been delayed in his loan repayments.\r\n\r\nEdgar is a very hard-working person and he likes his farming business very much.

Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es que conoce muchos lugares y trata con algunas personas que le ense\u00f1an t\u00e9cnicas y estrategias para aumentar sus ganancias en el tipo de labor que realiza. En la ciudad de Pucallpa, el principal medio de transporte es el motocarro, por ello, le es rentable, ya que el mismo maneja y administra sus ganancias diarias. Arturo considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es cuando no tiene en buenas condiciones su veh\u00edculo y no contar con un garaje para guardarlo. Con MFP, ya tiene 8 pr\u00e9stamos, y le gusta mucho trabajar con su banco comunal porque los integrantes son unidos y puntuales en los pagos.

For 7 years now he has provided transportation services with his own motor-car.  He works all day because he is a single father and wants to take care of his own needs; his children are now grown and have their own families.  What he enjoys about his work is that he gets to know a lot of places and he tries to learn from some people the technical aspects of his work and strategies for increasing the income he earns from his type of business.  The principal mode of transportation within the city of Pucallpa is by moto-car.  For this reason, his enterprise is profitable given that he himself drives his vehicle and administers his daily earnings.  Arturo considers the most difficult aspect of his business to be when his moto-car is in disrepair, and not having a garage to use for storage.  He already has had 8 loans with MFP, and he enjoys working with the cooperative bank greatly because the members are united and timely with their loan payments.  Arturo wants to invest the funds he is requesting into repairs for his moto-car, specifically for some replacement parts, for which he will spend 1,000 soles.  He will invest the remaining funds into his crops in order to have a good harvest.

He works as a delivery man at the ABAK bakery, but since 1991, he has been fattening sheep concurrently.  He has settled his first loan without difficulty.  With the current loan loan, he wants to bolster his business, that is, buying sheep to raise for a time and then selling them.  For example, if he buys eight sheep plus feed for 470,000 francs CFA, he can resell them at 720,000 francs.  He makes a good profit for repaying his loan regularly, and he's investing the rest in his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She sells jewelry and a variety of merchandise like cosmetics, perfumes and accessories that are on sale through specialty publications, or that have been ordered by her clients on credit or with cash. She started this 8 years ago, when a friend first introduced her to a specialized magazine that sells clothing and then later to another catalog that sells cosmetics. She works with these two sales options simultaneously and it's going very well. She was able to buy a display case, stock it and organize a commercial area in her own home where she exhibits the jewelry that she buys on credit in downtown Barranquilla, along with other products from the catalogs that she wants to show her customers. \r\n\r\nMargarita earns important income from this business that helps her to manage her household, which consists of her partner and their 3 children ages 4 to 23. She dreams of seeing them organized and successful in the future. Her long-term goal is to increase her business, improve the infrastructure with display cases and to diversify the merchandise she offers including fashionable and affordable handbags. \r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan is her first from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will buy merchandise that is on sale in her catalogs because she knows the tastes and needs of her customers and she will sell these products to them at good prices, meeting their requests. Her biggest challenge is selecting customers that buy on credit, because she has to be very careful with new customers so that she doesn't lose her capital. She hopes to gradually increase her business capital with this loan and with a lot of discipline in her work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":779189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise that is on sale in her catalogs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T05:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":122997},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":129443},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":131924},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":134453},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":137030},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":144153}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.19,"local_amount":122997,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126264.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673777},{"amount":72.81,"local_amount":129443,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":132881.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320336},{"amount":74.2,"local_amount":131924,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":135428.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803461},{"amount":75.63,"local_amount":134453,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":138024.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614538},{"amount":77.08,"local_amount":137030,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-26T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":140669.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568501},{"amount":81.09,"local_amount":144153,"processed_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":147982.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779845}],"funded_date":"2011-06-04T15:26:54Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":307056,"name":"Roxan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roxan is married.

She lives in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, located in Palestine. \r\n\r\nHala wants to purchase new home furniture instead of the old ones to improve her family life and live in better conditions. Since she hasn't enough money, she needs to take out a loan of $1,215.05 from FATEN. \r\n\r\nWhen Hala gets a FATEN loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase new home furniture, which will change her family life positively and let the family live in better conditions. \r\n\r\nHala is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead. \r\n\r\nAbout this loan product: \r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself.\r\n\r\nFATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. \r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's article on <a href= \"http:\/\/na3.salesforce.com\/_ui\/selfservice\/pkb\/PublicKnowledgeSolution\/d?orgId=00D500000006svl&lang=1&id=50150000000SN1N&retURL=\/sol\/public\/solutionbrowser.jsp%3Fsearch%3Dmuslim%2Bworld%26cid%3D02n50000000DUOS%26orgId%3D00D500000006svl%26lang%3D1%26t%3D4&ps=1&pPv=1\">Lending in the Muslim World<\/a>. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":870388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase home furniture to improve her family's living conditions.

She lives in her own house with her spouse, 42-year-old Ernesto, and what she desires most is to improve her quality of life. She has spent 10 years cooking for patrons of her restaurant, which is located in one of the most central streets of the city of Juliaca. Her business is one of the most frequented spots because it offers a great variety of dishes--as she says, \"something for all tastes\". She would like to have a larger restaurant where she could tend to more customers. She really enjoys cooking for and conversing with her diners, but the difficult part is taking care of everyone who visits her restaurant because it is too tiring for her alone. This is Olga's first loan with MFP. She hopes to pay it back on time and without problems. She is well respected in her communal bank, as she is the most active and committed member.

Together with his wife, Mavluda Sobirova, he is involved in baking and selling flatbread.  Previously, Abdusodyk worked as a baker at a bread factory.  Much like many of his countrymen, he lost his job after the fall of the Soviet Union.  He has to work a lot in order to support his big family.  His knowledge as a baker came in handy, when his wife and he decided to bake flatbread at home and sell it at the entrance of the food market.  It was hard for them at the beginning because they did not have a permanent retail location.  Big retailers used to force them out of the market.

She is 22 years old, married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Maricel owns and operates a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes from selling farm products, such as bananas and vegetables, in the local community. Maricel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Maricel joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.

Kumushay lives together with her family in the town of Tokmok. Kumushay's husband works as an electrician. Together they have raised three daughters. Their oldest and middle daughters are twenty nine and twenty six respectfully. They are both married. The youngest nineteen year old daughter lives with parents. Kumushay helps her husband to support the family the best she can. When she was still young, the relatives advised her to start doing animal husbandry. It's very convenient to run this business from home. When she got married Kumushay did not ignore this advice and had slowly bought some livestock. Right now Kumushay has two cows and two calves and sells the milk. All these years Kumushay had the opportunity to have a good income from milk sales and had also gradually increased the head count of cattle and sold it as was needed. Her youngest daughter and husband also help Kumushay to take care of the cattle after work. This is why Kumushay does not have any difficulties with her business. Kumushay is very worried about her youngest daughter's future. She is now studying at the university. She needs to pay the tuition fees. Kumushay and her husband alone cannot afford to pay the tuition and family's expenses at the same time. This is why Kumushay has decided to apply for a loan. But she does not want to take the loan and spend it all on the tuition. For the start, she wants to invest the loan money to buy a calf; after feeding it she will sell it and use the income to pay the tuition fees. This will allow her to save a great deal of money. Kumushay wants to buy a house in the same town in the future. \r\n\r\nKumushay's group partners are: Zuurakan, Nurbek and Jyldyz.\r\n\r\nZuurakan is forty four. Her husband works as a taxi driver. Zuurakan is a housewife, she keeps cows and sells milk. They have four children. Zuurakan has come for a loan to buy a milk cow.\r\n\r\nNurbek is forty three years old. Nurbek's wife sells food in the store. Nurbek himself keeps cattle and sells milk. They have four children. The youngest daughter is only four years old. Nurbek hopes to receive the loan and invest the money to buy calves.\r\n\r\nJyldyz is only twenty. But she is already running a big business. She has married early and took part in her husband's business \u2013 farming. At this time she milks eighteen cows daily and sells 50 litters of milk. Jyldyz hopes to receive the loan and invest the money in resale of large cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She produces on average up to 20-25 loaves of bread and 8-10 kg of buns per day. <p>\r\n\r\nSodnomtseren started her bakery business in 2004.

She is 45 years old. Estrelita is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEstrelita is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Estrelita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Estrelita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately PHP 5,000 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Estrelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estrelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of PHP 25,000 from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Estrelita is requesting a new loan of PHP 15,000, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Estrelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 23 years old and a woman who is very dedicated to her work.  She lives with 21 year-old Julio and they have three children.  They live together in their own home where understanding and mutual support reign.\r\n\r\nYanett's business is working the land.  She grows coffee and coca leaf.  In total, she has 3 hectares of land.  Yanett's parents taught her how to work the soil and she grew up with the desire to own her own farm.  She used some savings that she had made in order to fulfil her wish of owning her own plot of land.  Yanett knows a lot about the hard work of the countryside where she has been working for 20 years.  On harvest days she has the support of day laborers who transport her harvested produce for a certain stretch so that she can then sell it.  Yanett feels very dedicated to her work because, thanks to her daily effort, she can see that her plants are very productive and she makes good profits.  She tells us that she does not like the winter season because during those months insects abound which harms her yield.\r\n\r\nYanett is requesting this loan so that she can buy her own vehicle.  She will buy a motorbike for carrying cargo so that she can transport her produce to the markets more quickly.  Over time, she hopes to be able to buy more land and vary the crops she grows so that she can provide her family with good financial stability.  This is Yanett's eighth loan from MFP.  She has been very punctual in making her previous loan repayments and she hopes to continue being punctual in repaying this loan too.  Yanett is a very well-liked member of her community bank.  She will use the 3,000 Peruvian soles she has requested to buy her own vehicle, a motorbike for carrying cargo, so that she can transport her produce to the markets more quickly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":741805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motorbike for carrying cargo to transport her produce to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-31T10:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yanett ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3023.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621111}],"funded_date":"2011-04-02T03:51:04Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":290681,"name":"Perveen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perveen is married to M.

describe la historia del negocio de su madre desde que iniciaron la fabricaci\u00f3n y comercializcion de bolsos de cuero y de calzado.  \u201c El  negocio comienza hace 10 a\u00f1os, cuando comenzamos a venderle productos como calzado y sandalias a compa\u00f1eras de estudios en el bachillerato, cuando estudiaba   en el barrio arroz Barato de la ciudad de Cartagena, luego con el conocimiento de los productos , las ventas fueron creciendo y las mujeres d\u00eda a d\u00eda se inquietaban por conocer nuevos productos, as\u00ed fue como  incluimos   la l\u00ednea de bolsos adem\u00e1s de la l\u00ednea de calzado y accesorios, esta vez para damas y caballeros; en la medida en que yo iba estudiando en el Sena, escuela t\u00e9cnica apoyada por el estado ,  las personas cada vez se enamoraban de los productos hasta que empec\u00e9 a trabajar en el \u00e1rea de finanzas en diferentes empresas  y la lista de clientes se incrementaba cada d\u00eda, fue entonces cuando el negocio tom\u00f3  fuerzas  y adem\u00e1s de vender artesan\u00edas de nuestra tierra natal que es Momil, en el departamento de C\u00f3rdoba, con los materiales de ca\u00f1a flecha y otros como el cuero, tambi\u00e9n iniciamos negocios con mujeres tejedoras de san Jacinto Bol\u00edvar. Despu\u00e9s de todos estos a\u00f1os con un negocio informal,  es en el 2009 que con la participaci\u00f3n en un concurso de planes de negocios de varias organizaciones,  nos ganamos un capital semilla para comprar nuestra propia maquinaria, fue gracias a la viabilidad del proyecto y por todas las caracter\u00edsticas de rentabilidad y participaci\u00f3n en el desarrollo social de familias artesanas,  lo que nos hizo  merecedores del tercer lugar con $4.000.000 COP,  para iniciar el negocio,  el cual arroj\u00f3  como resultado la preferencia que los clientes tienen hacia los productos fusionados con cuero y ca\u00f1a flecha As\u00ed fue que decidimos formalizarnos ante C\u00e1mara de Comercio, la cual nos ha venido apoyando con programas de emprendimiento y empresario, en su programa de  j\u00f3venes empresarios, mujeres,  ecco ferias a nivel local y regional, foros, y ruedas de negocios, estamos muy agradecidas con esta entidad por el apoyo en las asesor\u00edas financieras, de mercadeo y de estrategias que nos han brindado;  hace poco recibimos un microcr\u00e9dito de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y tambi\u00e9n le estamos agradecidas debido a que el factor monetario a sido un verdadero reto de afrontar ,  ya que los recursos son pocos pero a pesar de todo hemos salido a delante y este a\u00f1o 2011 ha sido m\u00e1s que todo de arranque ya que para el 2012 nos vemos con el favor de Dios con metas por luchar y cumplir.

As we got to know the products better, sales improved and women were excited to see the new products daily.  This is how we included a line of purses to the line of footwear and accessories this time for women and men.  As I continued attending classes at SENA, a government-supported technical school, people became more and more enamored with the products until I started working in the financial area in various firms and our customer roster grew daily.  That was when the business really took off and besides selling crafts from our native land which is Momil in C\u00f3rdoba Department which are made from \u201cca\u00f1a flecha\u201d [a tall, tropical grass] and leather, we also started businesses with weavers in San Jacinto, Bol\u00edvar.\r\n\r\nAfter all these years in an informal business, in 2009 we participated in a business plan contest from various organizations and won seed capital to buy our own machinery.  Thanks to the viability of the project and because of its profitability characteristic s and the participation of artisanal families in social development, we won third prize: $4.000.000 COP to start the business which took off due to customer preference for items that combine ca\u00f1a flecha and leather.  \r\n\r\nWe then decided to formalize ourselves with the Chamber of Commerce which has been supporting us with business and entrepreneurial programs as part of their programs for young business people, women, local and regional eco fairs, forums and business roundtables.  We are very grateful to this entity for the support in financial, marketing and strategy assessments it\u2019s afforded us.  \r\n\r\nA short while ago we received a micro loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and we are also grateful to it because the monetary factor has been a real challenge to face since resources are few.  Despite it all, we have gotten ahead and 2011 has been for the most part a launching pad for 2012 when we have goals to strive toward and with God\u2019s favor to meet.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve always worked as a team.  My mother in the production, publicity and sales areas and myself, in addition to supporting productive and commercialization efforts, I take care of everything related to the sales expos both locally and nationally because having qualified as a professional from a technological educational institution, I have the opportunity to access all Colombian potential jobs.\r\n\r\nFor us, it\u2019s very gratifying to share our small experience and especially to show you how much we love our business and the great commitment and responsibility we have to see it succeed more every day especially with support from Kiva loans which we will use to buy leather in large amounts to manufacture good quality purses and footwear to exhibit during the most commercial season which is Christmas and New Year.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":966843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy leather in large amounts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-29T19:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":78294},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":80121},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":81991},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83904},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":85862},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":87865},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":89915},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":92013},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":94160},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":96357},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":98606},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100912}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.07},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.07,"local_amount":78294,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":81707.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188834},{"amount":43.06,"local_amount":80121,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83614.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325080},{"amount":89.15,"local_amount":165895,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":173127.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140885},{"amount":82.05,"local_amount":152692,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":159349.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338400},{"amount":127.47,"local_amount":237199,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":247540.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130073},{"amount":191.2,"local_amount":355799,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":371311.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498072}],"funded_date":"2011-12-30T06:37:58Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":380864,"name":"Matilde","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Matilde de 62 a\u00f1os,  vive en  el municipio de Soledad y tiene 2 hijos en las edades de 33 y 36 a\u00f1os respectivamente.

He lives in a rented house with his wife of three years, and together they have a daughter. Since he was married, he has planted potatoes in rented fields. He has had a contract for two years. He grows for seed because it is more profitable than growing for consumption. He sends his product to the city of Arequipa. He also provides Internet service in his neighborhood, which generates a very good income. Gabriel would like to break into other businesses, like serving as a middleman in the buying and selling of potatoes. Of all his activities, he identifies most closely with agriculture. Although he has occasionally had big losses, it has also given him a lot of satisfaction. He enjoyed working and cultivating the land as part of his childhood. Gabriel is very punctual in making all of his payments, and this is his eighth loan with MFP. This loan will be used to purchase seeds and fertilizers, as he plans to plant the same field he has just harvested.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":293043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T18:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1629.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080283}],"funded_date":"2009-03-24T20:37:04Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":101366,"name":"Davaasuren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Davaasuren J. is 45, married, and the mother of two.

Togoontumur lives with her mother and daughter in Arhangay, one of Mongolia's central provinces. Her mother is retired and stays home, taking care of Togoontumur\u2019s daughter.  In 2005, Togoontumur started a business selling souvenirs.

She says that she is faced with the high price of chicken feed due to the season but otherwise, her business is good. She has hopes of expanding her business plus educating her children to the highest level. Rose needs a loan to be able to buy more day old chicks for her farm expansion and to buy more feed for the existing chickens. She will save money by buying in bulk.

Cerila has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2008, Cerila joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Cerila is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her fifth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":604929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

His challenge at the moment is that he is not fully utilizing his whole piece of land because he used up all the proceeds form his last harvest to pay his children's school fees. So, he was not able to buy the seeds and fertilizers needed to plant his whole land.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He hopes that he can get a loan from DINARI foundation to enable him to buy fertilizer and pesticide. <p>\r\nHe participated in a 6 month DINARI foundation program where he can repay the loan at the end of the program period.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":220668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer, pesticide etc (Membeli pupuk, anti hama dan ongkos tenaga kerja)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-11-22T02:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Komang Muriada","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":5000000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5128287.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973903}],"funded_date":"2008-11-23T16:30:18Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:22:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Antonius Gunadi","image":null}},{"id":76806,"name":"Phea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phea N. is a farmer in Thorm Ney village in Takeo Province.

Not having gone to school due to societal reasons, this woman was introduced to an income-generating business, the dyeing of cloth.  She learned this trade in Bamako (capital of Mali) from ANTOU, a local celebrated dye expert.  \r\n\r\nMariame enjoys a solid reputation in this business and receives many orders, especially for ceremonies (marriages, baptisms, holidays, etc.).  But her own resources cannot allow her to meet the demand.  And so, she's requesting a collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso, with which she is on her fourth individual loan, after having correctly repaid all the preceding ones.  She intends to buy five bolts of white damask fabrics, ten bags of caustic soda, and ten containers of dyes of different colors.  Supplies are gotten from wholesalers in Bamako for her raw materials (white damask, caustic soda, and dyes).  The white damask is put into different colors and then sold, either in cash or credit transactions, to customers composed of women in her area. \r\n\r\nWith this fourth loan, she intends to realize an

She does not want to rely on her children to support her. Emma lives in the village of Brgy Tagda, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. She has been a widow for 19 years and has raised her six children well.  Now that they are all adults, have their own families, and are gainfully employed, Emma wants to save for her future support so she will not be a burden to her children in her old age.\n\nWhen she was widowed, the demands of her business and the need to sustain a young family impelled Emma to slowly recover from the grief of losing her husband at such a young age. She continued running her business until the increasing financial needs of the family prompted her to look for an external source of capital. In 2004, Emma became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon and was able to sustainably increase her income and meet the needs of her household. \n\nAlong with a general store, Emma later invested in a fish vending business in her community, where regular customers come to buy fish. Her general store and fish vending business have a combined average income of PHP 6,000 per month, which is enough to cover her household expenses with some left over for savings so she can stay independent in her old age. \n\nEmma borrowed PHP 13,000 on a previous loan, and was able to repay it on an installment basis in full and on time without any delays. Since it is the rainy season now, Emma expects sales to be slower than it was earlier this year, so she is requesting to loan the smaller amount of PHP 11,000  right now which she foresees as sufficient additional capital she needs to continue expanding her general store without sacrificing her profitability because of the anticipated slower inventory turnover.\n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few women but thousands of them. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a meager $1 a day, to creating realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":401237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Some months ago, he separated from his former wife after many years of marriage. They have 3 children, of whom 2 are now adult and independent, and only the remaining 1, a minor aged 17, is still dependent upon his father for support in his studies. It is for the sake of this child that Enrique works day after day, to offer him a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nEnrique works at one of the multiple trades he has performed in his life; he is a brick mason and much in demand by his neighbors, because he is well known and experienced in his zone. He works with the number of helpers he requires, depending on the size of the job. Things are going well for him in this business. And he also operates his moto-taxi which offers an additional income.\r\n\r\nEnrique enjoys a great deal working in construction. He understands that in this worthy profession he can provide education and a good standard of living for his family. Enrique has done this for 12 years and he considers the most difficult task transporting heavy blocks and having to mix cement with his own hands. This has caused his hands to age rapidly.\r\n\r\nEnrique wants to replace his old tools in order to improve his work, and to buy replacement parts for his moto-taxi. This will be his 12th loan through MFP and he is very moved to know that we will provide economic backing so that he can continue with his plans. That's why Enrique will not fail in his payments; he promises to be punctual in paying and, above all, responsible.  He is very content to continue with his group which is very reliable and friendly.\r\n\r\nWith the solicited 3,000 new sols, Enrique will purchase materials to continue his work, especially  lumber and wood lath,  as well as parts to replace defective ones on his moto-taxi.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":951687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"buy tools and lumber, plus replacement parts for his moto-taxi.

She is in the poultry business and has 350 chickens. Her chickens are layers, so she gets a little less than one egg per day per chicken. She will sell them wholesale in trays of 36 eggs to a tray and each tray will be sold for about 3,000 schillings or about $1.75US per tray. Therefore, if you do the math, she will get about 9 trays per day x $1.75 per tray and you see she will gross about $15.00US per day. Out of that she will have to take into account the cost of the chickens, the feed, etc. But this is a very good business if you have enough room for a lot of chickens, and on a small plot of land 350 chickens are a lot of chickens.

His wife does not work, and thus, he carries the burden alone through his farming income to meet his family\u2019s needs. I Nengah Sedra works on a 1-hectare farm owned by his parents. His family\u2019s daily expense is quite expensive especially since his children are still in school. His harvests are sometimes not maximized because his cultivation method and seeds are not the best. Better farming equipment, seeds and supporting materials require a larger capital, which he didn\u2019t have. I Nengah Sedra is relieved that DINARI is helping him get a loan he needs to improve his farming. This loan will be used to buy superior seeds, organic fertilizers and pesticides. I Nengah Sedra rents a tractor to till his farm because he doesn\u2019t have an ox to do the job. I Nengah Sedra is waiting for his next harvest, which he hopes to yield better results from his previous harvests. He will use his farming income to support his children\u2019s educational needs, and if there is still some money left, he really hopes to fix his unfinished house.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Joan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nI Nengah Sedra seorang petani yang sangat rajin dan ulet, semua dilakukan supaya ekonomi keluarga bisa tercukupi. Apalagi istrinya tidak mempunyai penghasilan tambahan sebagai pendukung keuangan keluarga. I Nengah Sedra hanya mengandalkan penghasilan dari pertanian untuk mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga. Sawah yang dikerjakan seluas 1 hektar dan itu pun masih menjadi milik orang tuanya. Biaya yang dikeluarkan setiap hari cukup besar apalagi anak-anaknya masih duduk dibangku sekolah. Sedangkan dari hasil panen yang diperoleh tidaklah maksimal karena dalam pengolahan tanah maupun pembibitan dan pemeliharaan tidak bisa dilakukan dengan maksimal,ini semua karena terbentur dengan modal. Tetapi sekarang I Nengah Sedra sudah merasa lega karena adanya pinjaman dari Yayasan Dinari untuk menunjang usahanya dibidang pertanian. Modal tersebut dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit unggul,pupuk organik dan juga obat pestisida. Pengolahan tanah dilakukan dengan menyewa traktor, karena I Nengah Sedra tidak mempunyai sapi untuk membajak. Kini I Nengah Sedra sedang menunggu panen tiba, ia sangat berharap panen kali ini berhasil dan mendapat keuntungan yang meningkat dari panen sebelumnya. Keuntungan ini nantinya akan dipergunakan untuk menunjang pendidikan anak-anaknya dan apabila ada sisa I Nengah Sedra ingin sekali bisa memperbaiki rumahnya yang belum selesai dibangun."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":148689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

This is 42-year-old Hidaya B. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with three children, aged from 13 to 23 years old. Since 2007, Hidaya has been running a shop that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. <p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan of $250 in order to purchase additional inventory at bulk prices in order to expand her business. She thanks you in advance for supporting her!<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She tends to her barn and sells her cows' milk, and has been doing so for 10 years. She wakes up very early to cut the grass to feed her animals. During the morning she goes out to sell the milk she's collected, up to 60 liters per day. She sells it to a company that processes milk products, which covers her children's expenses. There are risks, however; for example, her cows get sick with the type of cold weather they're experiencing in their area right now. Because of this, she is taking precautionary measures to protect her barn from the cold. In the future, she would like to expand the space where she raises her cows to increase their number and produce more milk. This is her third loan from MFP.

her own initiative, when Gulshod was 23 she learned how to make national dresses using a sewing machine. This activity has made it possible for her to contribute to her family's income and satisfactorily meet the most urgent needs of her two small children. Every item of dresses Gulshod produces is superior, and due to this, her orders have markedly increased. She has some very large orders so that many times it would be impossible to fulfill them if she didn't have an assistant. Her incredible energy, fortitude, and commitment to her clients drive her to offer them new and improved service. To this end, Gulshod wants to speed up her dress production by purchasing fabrics. To accomplish her objective, she is asking for a 4000 Somoni loan to buy new modern fabrics. With your help, you can make her dream come true. Gulshod thanks you for your generous contribution.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B., 52, lives with his wife and their three children in a community called  Cimarr\u00f3n de Santa Teresita de Turrialba in the Cartago province.  It is a small, rural community with approximately 2,000 inhabitants.  The population works in milk production and farming.  The landscape is irregular, and much of the land is humid tropical rain forest.  Cimarr\u00f3n is located approximately one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, the closest commercial center.  However, several times a year the road becomes impassable because of the rains.\r\n\r\nAbel is a milk producer.  At this time he wishes to get a loan for \u00a2500.000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy one more dairy cow to increase production.  He knows that having another cow is a big sacrifice, and that it will demand more work. He says that if he wants to get his family ahead, he needs to make the effort to produce more.\r\n\r\nHe does his work in a place equipped to milk.  He says that he produces approximately 80 liters of milk a day.  With an additional cow his production would increase to 100 liters daily.  That is why he is very excited to be able to see how his business grows and gets stronger.\r\n\r\nAbel is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Nuevas Esperanzas para Cimarr\u00f3n (the New Hope for Cimmar\u00f3n Communal Bank), one of the 100 member organizations of Edesa in Costa Rica.  This will be his second loan.  With the loan he hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level.  He will also actively participate in the credit organization in his community.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

However, he works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business doing well.\r\n\r\n He is using his loan of 50,000 KES to buy more bags and restock his general store to grow his business and meet the demand of his customers. In future, he hopes to acquire more space to expand his business, educate his children, and develop his plot of land by building on it. He describes himself as resilient.
