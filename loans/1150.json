district of Pursat Province, Satas struggles for a living as a single mother for the sake of her kids via food selling: noodles and porridge. She has been with this business for two years and can earn about 26,400 KHR per day.  Her previous loan was her first loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

This is the family\u2019s only source of income. \r\n\r\nThe family is currently facing many problems with the business, as the stock of car accessories is almost depleted, and they have no funds to purchase more stock. \r\n\r\nMusarat has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband can continue his business. He will purchase a variety of spare parts and decoration kits, like car chargers, fog lights, engine parts, rims, seat covers and neon lights. \r\n\r\nWith profits from the business, Musarat will make arrangements for the marriage of her son and for the expansion of their business. She is very hopeful that the loan will be productive for the family and she is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their

The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her children\u2019s education and cover their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRosario hopes to have her own store and dreams that her children will finish their studies.  She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her goal is to save enough money to send her children to the university so that they can get training and be able to take over the family business when they inherit the land.\r\n\r\nShe has already taken two loans from Aqroinvest in the past. With a good loan history, she has applied for her third loan of 1500 AZN to buy mineral fertilizers to treat her soil and get a good harvest.

He needs additional capital for the growth of his business as the demands of his clients are increasing day-by-day. Therefore, his wife, Haleema, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, for her husband's store. He will purchase a variety of products, including flour, milk packs, eggs, pulses, detergents, oils, etc. to cope with the increased demand of clients.

She lives with her husband and four children in Punjab, Pakistan. Since 2000, her husband has been running a general store, which is the only source of income for the family. Yasmeen also helps her husband in his business; he needs additional capital for the growth of his business. For that she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. With the loan money, her husband can buy a variety of products, like flour, sugar, eggs, and rice for his general store. This will help him to satisfy his clients more professionally, as well as increase his savings for the better future of his children. With the profits expected from this loan, Yasmeen intends to expand her husband's business so that she can purchase a sewing machine for her personal use. Yasmeen and her husband are very hopeful that the loan will be a lucky and productive one for their

She has been living in her mother's house with her two children for fifteen years.  Throughout her life, Jacqueline has learned everything there is to know about farming and cattle raising.  She now grows small quantities of corn, potatoes and alfalfa, with the alfalfa being particularly useful for feeding her animals.  However, the work that she likes most is raising sheep and guinea pigs, which she sells from time to time in order to have a source of income to invest in her family's well-being.  Jacqueline tells us that she enjoys her work because she always has enough in stock to sell and to feed her family.  She would like to have more land and sheep.

At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJessamin operates a vegetable growing farm. He grows vegetables and some bananas on their farm.  The farm is located in Cavite, in the highlands  suited to grow vegetables and other fruits. He regularly sells his product to a market, and to the local community.  He earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. He will use the loan to buy fertilizer and farm inputs for his business. Part of the loan will go to the maintenance of the farm. \r\n\r\nJessamin hopes that his business will continue to grow. He meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week; he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

She lives together with her husband Miguel and their two children in the home of her in-laws.  At this time she is facing an economic crisis.  She rented some land where she planted alfalfa, but the owners of the land sold it while the crop was still green.  This caused her to lose her entire investment, but she is not defeated.  She learned from this experience and now she is a little more careful, thus she will plant alfalfa on her own agricultural land, which is small, and she also plans to buy grown alfalfa from third parties.  Her main source of income focuses on selling bundles of alfalfa, which she sends daily to another city.  This is her third credit with Kiva and she feels happy for the financial support that she receives in order to continue her business.

She lives with her husband and five children in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Since 2010, her husband has been running a general store, and he works very hard to meet his family\u2019s needs. Due to the large family size and their low monthly income, they are facing many problems. Her husband needs additional capital for the growth of his business. She has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can invest in her husband\u2019s shop. With the loan, her husband would expand the general store. He would add some more space to it by building one more room. He would also buy a variety of goods, such as rice, sugar, soap, cereals, milk and utility items, for his store, to satisfy his clients more professionally and to increase his savings to better the future of his children. The profits would be used to expand the business and pay household expenses. Azra and her husband are very hopeful that the loan will be a lucky and productive one for their family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1367325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married to Sonny, who is a driver, and they have children together. By the grace of God, she has managed to support their children's schooling. At the moment, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCrisales oversees the operations of their jeepney business (small bus - see footnote). She has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which earns  boundary (rent) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippines Pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy spare parts, and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She is planning to expand her business and therefore expects an increase in her business income.  \r\n\r\nCrisales dreams of having a better life. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work. At the meetings, she can also draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\nFootnote: Interestingly, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and make their microfinance loan repayments.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1367343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To pay for the spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-06-09T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-09T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Crisales","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5262.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381670148},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4210,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534678},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5262.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784074},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771074}],"funded_date":"2013-06-10T03:46:46Z","paid_date":"2013-10-20T08:38:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pippa Gawley","image":null}},{"id":569604,"name":"Shagufta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shagufta is a 33-year-old energetic and diligent woman.

They have two children, ages 8 and 3.  They live in their partially completed home and are hoping to finish it soon.  She has been raising potatoes for four years (tubers), also corn, and peas, with her father\u2019s help.  He taught her to farm, work the land, and do all that is necessary for farming.  She built half of her house with the proceeds from the sale of her potatoes, and she expects the next harvest to be more productive and earn what she needs to build the other half.  She says that she began working a short time ago as a health promoter for the state, looking for malnourished children in her area.  She earns extra money.\r\n\r\nShe also raises livestock such as pigs, donkeys, and rams, which she later sells in the central market in town.

For the past two years, Mary has been working hard to manage her salon, where she does hair dressing. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mary has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more hair care products for the salon, and will help Mary to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young sister. Mary hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand the salon into a unisex salon. \r\n\r\nMary is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

emprendi\u00f3 su propia aventura de negocios en lo que mas sabe y le gusta hacer: \u201cel Pan\u201d. Pedro trabaj\u00f3  empleado  en una productora de ponqu\u00e9s muy reconocida y por eso aprendi\u00f3 las mejores t\u00e9cnicas para trabajar la harina, elaborar dulces, tortas, ponqu\u00e9s y panes en las diferentes l\u00edneas: pan dulce, pi\u00f1ita, de queso, frutas cristalizadas, navide\u00f1os  etc. Todos los d\u00edas de lunes a s\u00e1bados y desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 4 de la tarde Pedro est\u00e1 trabajando en su oficio y distribuye sus productos en tiendas del sector que son sus principales clientes. Su meta m\u00e1s adelante es mejorar sus activos fijos y aumentar la producci\u00f3n, para tener un mejor nivel de vida. En la actualidad Pedro est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor volumen materias primas e insumos, como harina, az\u00facar, grasas, para ganar descuentos por compras en mayor volumen y desde all\u00ed mejorara sus utilidades, y es que el mayor desaf\u00edo de Pedro, es obtener fuentes de financiamientos y esto es lo que hace que su credikiva  sea exitoso, adem\u00e1s de que en el municipio,  ganar\u00e1 mas reconocimiento y sus ventas se impactar\u00e1n,  y aumentar el nivel de ingresos que beneficiar\u00e1 a su familia, conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 6 hijos en las edades de 14 a 23 a\u00f1os. ","en":"At age 55, Pedro still bakes bread and with his 20 years\u2019 experience, he started his own business two years ago, doing what he knows and loves best, bread.  Pedro worked in a well-known bakery and learned the best methods to work with flour, make candies, sandwiches, and different types of bread, sweet, pi\u00f1ata, cheese, crystalized fruit, Christmas, etc.  Every day, from Monday through Saturday from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm, Pedro works in his field and distributes his products to stores in the area, who are his main customers.  His goal in the future is to improve his fixed assets and increase production so that he can improve his life.\r\n\r\nPedro is asking for a Kiva loan and it will be his first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

He had not had other loans from state banks before but FUDECOSUR has offered him the loan with greater ease and a much lower interest rate."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":519.24,"image":{"id":1366385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to plant coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Oratorio, Platanarares, Perez zeledon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2013-06-10T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-10T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gilberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":56,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2017-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.39,"local_amount":66998.45,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:50:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67360.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":490830827},{"amount":199.43,"local_amount":99714.97,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":100253.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530023715},{"amount":0.05,"local_amount":26.51,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":26.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991853},{"amount":185.76,"local_amount":92878.28,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-24T13:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":93379.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752080203}],"funded_date":"2013-06-11T22:54:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melanie Snellings","image":null}},{"id":569659,"name":"Adwowa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Although she received no formal education, Adwowa is an entrepreneur.

She is a very kind, hardworking woman who wants to get ahead in her business and is eager to provide a better quality of life to her three children, who are currently attending school. Having worked in the farming business for more than 20 years, Nov and her spouse are able to make a net profit of 10,000 KHR per day.\r\n\r\nNov has never done business with any state banks before and she\u2019s very grateful to be granted a loan through HKL branch office. She has mentioned that only HKL can provide her a much lower interest rate and a long term payment plan. The loan amounting to $1,000 US dollars will allow her to buy a motorcycle which is very useful for the family to get from one place to another especially to a far distant area without any payments to motor taxi service. In this way, Nov will save a bit on transportation and can use it for the future for any family emergency.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1365314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal

In order to increase her sales, she needs to purchase packs of flour, oil, salt and spices. For this reason, she applied for a loan of Rs 40,000 from Kashf Foundation.

Martha, who is one of the members of the \u201cBoilen Lom Group\u201d.  She is the featured borrower. She is on the extreme left with her hand raised in the picture. \n\nThe group members reside in a village which is about 40 kms away from the capital city of Manipur, in the northeastern side of India. With younger siblings to take care of and a weary mother, life was not easy for Martha. Her friends motivated her to join the group, and she availed the loan and started her own retail shop.\n\nShe runs a variety shop at the local market, which is about a three-minute walk from home. She started her business by selling mobile recharge vouchers and gradually refilled her recharge voucher shop with daily essential items like detergent soap, detergent powder, shampoo sachets, etc. for sale.  The shop is also refilled with candies, chocolates, sweets and other cosmetic items. \n\nShe is making a fine profit and also started saving. She gets the stock from the main city market and also from people who trade items through the Army Canteen. She says it is profitable to purchase stock from the Army Canteen. The profit is high because the goods are purchased at a low cost price and can be sold at a market price. \n\nShe wanted to use the savings that she manages for refilling her shop with different items. She says the amount is small; therefore she was still waiting for another few months. God still favors her because when she was really in need for a capital amount, Kiva came into the limelight.\n\nWith the assistance of a Kiva loan, and together with her small savings, she is planning to purchase women\u2019s wraparound skirts exported from the neighbouring states like Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya. She says the main costume for women in the state is wraparound skirts, which she believes is a good trade for earning. It will not be a difficult business because the market is large in respect to women\u2019s wraparound skirts. \n\nMartha says, \u201cIt is a wonderful experience for me that people from far-flung countries help us in our needs. Thanks to Kiva and may God bless.\u201d\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1367302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase exported women's wraparound skirts from the neighbouring states, sell them, and make more savings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-06-10T07:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-10T07:30:17Z","loan_amount":4225,"lender_count":129,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaiting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengpichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahneichin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneivah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengvei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhinghoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinkhoneng ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veineichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":240000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":240000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T13:38:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":569598,"name":"Shehnaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shehnaz is a 51-year-old woman living in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

They know each other through being neighbours, relations and traders at the local market.\n\nThe members of the group are involved in the small-scale trading of garnishes (garlic, Maggi condiments, dried okra, etc.) and vegetables (tomatoes, aubergine, cabbages, etc.). In order to increase their business funds, the members of the group have decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and this is their first solidarity loan cycle.\n\nMamou (pictured on the far left) sells vegetables. She will use her loan to buy ten baskets of fresh tomatoes and five sacks of cabbages. She buys her supplies at a market in Bamako from stallholders who come from places such as Kati, Sikasso and the area around Bamako, according to the best offers. She then sells on her goods to individuals at her local market.

She has 18 years experience in this line of work and, every harvest time, she sells her crops in a nearby city where wholesale buyers from a well-known market come and buy the food produced on the land that Rosa cares for.  However, as she is a woman who is very dedicated to her farming work, Rosa also works as a day laborer on other people's crops.  She does this in her free time as it allows her to keep an eye on her crops too and not neglect them. She also raises animals such as guinea pigs and donkeys.  She uses the former to feed her family and sells their meat whenever she finds herself in financial difficulty.  She uses the latter for carrying loads.  \r\n\r\nThis is Rosa's third loan from Kiva and she feels happy to be receiving this financial support as it will enable her to continue in her business.  Rosa will invest the 3,000 soles she has requested in buying organic fertilizers with which to nourish her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":661617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Even though she did not receive any formal education, Adwowa is a successful businesswoman.

Iuri requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions.\n \nThe main source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. They have: two milk cows, two calves, and one pig. Also, they own a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees and maize are grown. The whole family is involved in their agriculture. Iuri\u2019s wife and daughter-in-law are milking the cows and producing dairy products. Iuri and his son are cultivating the land and growing the harvest. All the products are sold among the villagers, or at the local market, and the family earns a small monthly income.\n\nIuri has requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Iuri has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to other credit products.

St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for its fish, due to its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb, located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.

Only one lives at home and is in school. She completed 12 grades. \r\n\r\nElizabeth runs a shop business, selling used shoes. She describes herself as a serious businesswoman. She started her business 21 years ago, using money given to her by her husband. Typically, she works at her business from 8am to 5pm, Monday to Saturday and she transports her goods to her business by a shared taxi. She cites her greatest challenge as small capital. She is proud of her business because it supports her home.\r\n\r\nUsing the proceeds of this loan, she intends to purchase more used shoes for her business.

St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nWeedor is 39 years old, married with two children aged 11 and 8, who live at home and are in school. She completed 12 grades.\r\n\r\nShe runs a cook shop business selling rice and soup.  She describes herself as a serious businesswoman. She started her business ten years ago, using money given to her by her husband.  Typically, she works 7 am to 8 pm from Monday to Saturday at her business and transports her goods to her business by shared taxi.  She cites her greatest challenge as not enough capital.  She is proud of her business because she makes a lot of profit.\r\n\r\nUsing the proceeds of this loan, she intends to purchase more rice, peppers, oil, Vita, onions, fish, and dried bush-meat for her business.  In the future, she plans to build her house and educate her children.  She sincerely thanks you in advance for your

Claire is 22 years old and lives in the town of Kalerwe in the Kampala East region of Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past two years, Claire has been working hard to manage her poultry farm, which sells poultry chicken. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Claire has requested a loan of 500000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more chicks and feed for the farm, and will help Claire generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young sister. Claire hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a commercial house for herself. \r\n\r\nClaire is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She has managed to employ one person at her trading booth. She is convinced that her business will be successful because it is what her customers need, and is located at the city centre, convenient for everyone.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is the lack of money in the business. Right now, Gwendoline is operating with a minimum working capital of $1000. This is not enough because it limits the number of customers she can attend to, especially since she is located at one of the busiest places in town.\r\n\r\nAs her customers are very important to her, Gwendoline wants to use the loan money to increase her working capital. This will also enable her to serve her customers that are sending and receiving larger sums of money. She says having more money in the business will also help her earn more profits. The anticipated increase in her profit margins will give Gwendoline a chance to give her unborn child a better life. \r\n\r\nGwendoline dreams of expanding her business by opening more mobile money

Misozi continues to pursue her accounting studies through evening classes while managing her growing Zoona mobile money transfer business. She would like to thank her lenders for the first loan they gave her. The loan helped her increase her working capital and paint her shop. This enabled her to serve more customers and earn more profits since her shop is now more visible to potential customers and she has cash to transact. She has been saving most of her profits in order to open two more shops; one in Kitwe's Chimwemwe compound and another right next to her main shop in downtown Lusaka. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a second Kiva loan, so that she can increase her working capital for her newest shop which is located in the main Lusaka town. Misozi says in the business of mobile money transfers, money is always moving and as such the more customers you have, the more money you need to satisfy them. Misozi's new shop sees a lot of customers coming and going since it is located very close to many banks and the main post office. This has the potential to give Misozi a lot of customers, but unfortunately she does not have enough working capital float to satisfy them all.

","en":"Feruza is a 37 year-old woman.  She is married and a mother of three remarkable children.  After finishing school, she did not go to a university due to a lack of opportunity.  Feruza is a very hardworking and energetic young woman.  Her husband is working in the Russian Federation.  The husband's salary alone is not enough, and this is why Feruza decided not to stay at home and to help her husband.  She decided to earn money independently.  She opened her store, where she provides copy services, two years ago in the district center.  Feruza attracted enough customers over these two years.  Currently, she wants to expand and start providing computer services.  In order to realize her plans, she has to purchase a computer, but does not have enough money for this.  This is why Feruza requested a loan from the Arvand organization.  Feruza expresses her gratitude to the Arvand organization for the provided help in advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1365185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a computer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-10T20:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-10T20:10:22Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feruza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":304.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":315.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":326.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":337.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":349.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":361.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":374.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":387.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":414.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":429.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.81},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.68,"local_amount":304.37,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":307.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616135},{"amount":66.94,"local_amount":315.02,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":318.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860004},{"amount":69.29,"local_amount":326.05,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":329.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136748},{"amount":71.71,"local_amount":337.46,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":341.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900943},{"amount":74.22,"local_amount":349.27,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":352.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550124},{"amount":76.81,"local_amount":361.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":365.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774348},{"amount":79.51,"local_amount":374.15,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":378.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673480},{"amount":82.29,"local_amount":387.24,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":391.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144272},{"amount":85.17,"local_amount":400.8,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":405.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960096},{"amount":88.15,"local_amount":414.83,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":419.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180868},{"amount":91.23,"local_amount":429.31,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":433.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875472}],"funded_date":"2013-06-15T11:17:40Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":569792,"name":"Saro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saro lives in Kaloleni, near Mariakani, Kenya.

Her husband is a security guard but his income is not enough to support the home.\r\n\r\nShe's been in this business since just after she got married and sells fish within her community. She says that at present her business is doing well because out of the profit she was able to take care of her family.\r\n\r\nSia requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone to purchase more fish for resale.

This is 25-year-old Salamatu from Tombo, Western Rural Area. She is married with one child who is three years old. \r\n\r\nSalamatu runs a clothing business; she sells wax cotton within her community. She has been running this business since 2003. She works at the business ten hours per day and seven days per week. Salamatu says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nSalamatu has requested a loan in order to purchase more wax cotton for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her status of living and increase her business. In the future, she plans to open a big clothing shop. She thanks you for your support\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1367636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She began her business because she needed to generate income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours a day, 7 days a week. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nMabinty requires a loan in order to buy more fish and palm oil to resell.

","en":"Abdunabu is a young fellow of 29. He is married and has two young daughters. Abdunabu lives with his family in a small village. He gets along fine with all of his neighbors, for he is a sensitive and kind person who is always ready to help anyone in need. As a young boy, Abdunabu used to help his father, who was a carpenter. And he learned this trade from his father. He started with small structures, but now he can build a large house. He has been working as a carpenter for 8 years, taking orders for construction, performing the work, and earning a good, stable income. His work is in demand throughout the year. He has many clients who consider his work to be both of high quality and thorough. At the moment Abdunabu wants to build a new house for his family and needs financing. He needs to buy lots of building materials to build this planned house. So he has come to Arvand and is requesting a loan to buy building materials. Abdunabu is counting on your support and thanks you in advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1361538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

","en":"This is Buvsara's second loan from us.  She has a good credit history, since she is an honest and responsible woman.  Buvsara is 46 years old and she is married with four children at home.  Her husband is a migrant worker because he couldn't find suitable work in his own country.  While she was still living in her childhood home, Buvsara began to sew women's national costumes.  She sews dresses with a great deal of interest - it is her favorite thing to do.  Buvsara's craft has come in handy because after she got married, her husband's income was not enough to support the family.  She works hard to provide for her children.  She has a plot of land where she has started building a new home for her family.  At the moment, she doesn't have enough money to finish the construction of the home.  She is asking for a loan of 3,000 US dollars to buy building materials like cement, sand, wood, etc.  She is awaiting your kindness and promises to repay her loan on

Gulniso's husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation.  He works there and sends money to his wife and children so they can buy the things they need.  For more than 15 years, Gulniso has been working as a school teacher.  When she is not working, she grows crops because she is poor and needs the money.  She consulted with her husband about going to university for a second degree and he supported her.
