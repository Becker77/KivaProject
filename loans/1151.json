district, with his wife and two children who he loves and who are his main focus in life.  Renan is a very friendly, hard-working, enthusiastic person who, together with his wife, puts all his efforts into providing for his family.  Unfortunately, owing to a lack of financial resources and the need to work from a very young age in order to help his family, Renan was unable to complete his primary education which made it impossible for him to study for a degree in Veterinary Medicine as he would have liked to have done.  In his free time, Renan enjoys relaxing by watching television and he sometimes cooks a delicious 'tallarines rojos' (spaghetti with tomato sauce) to share with his family.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, and with a lot of determination and dedication, Renan works as a farmer.  He has a small plot of land where he grows cassava.  He carries out his farm work every day and, in addition, he also provides plowing services on other people's land.  Renan works for approximately 10 hours every day and believes that he is doing well because of his experience and the kind way he treats others.\r\n\r\nRenan is very grateful to Kiva lenders as, thanks to their help, he will be able to cover the cost of irrigating, fertilizing and harvesting his cassava crops.  This will allow him to ensure the suitable growth of his crops and he will be able to continue working hard to realize his dream of expanding the crops he grows."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1367086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to cover the cost of irrigating, fertilizing and harvesting his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"GUADALUPE","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-11T13:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-11T13:10:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Renan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1566.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067392}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T03:45:20Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":570063,"name":"Belen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Belen is a married woman who has two children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living through her sari-sari or variety store business, selling various goods and items to the people in her place.  \r\n\r\nBelen is asking for a loan to buy more stocks to sell like canned goods, candies, soda, soap and toiletries, cooking ingredients and others.

Also, part of the loan will be invested in her clothing business. Alang will buy clothes in town markets and retail them in local markets around the region. \r\n\r\nShe believes this business will be successful because she has been involved in this line of business for a long time and has experience in the business. She is very sure to obtain maximum profit from this business. With this business activity, the community will have a regular source of plastic paper of all types. Also, the community will have a good supply of clothing because people will not go a long distance to buy clothes, both for themselves and their children, at moderate price.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, Alang will educate her children, provide three square meals to her family, cater for her children's medication, and provide other necessities to her family. She prefers Grounded and Holistic Approach for People's Empowerment (GHAPE) loans because of low interest rates and convenient repayment intervals, and the training offered at GHAPE. Also, the social talks at GHAPE meetings are of interest to her.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1368030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Paynesville North has the largest market in Montserrado County.  The area is home to 'round time marketers', traders who travel to the interior to purchase various goods to sell throughout the county.  As a result, there is a high concentration of wholesalers in the area who distribute to various markets around Montserrado County, including Monrovia.\n\nNaomi started her business with money from her mother; she has owned her own table business for the past ten years, selling rubber dishes such as bowls, plates, spoons, etc.  She transports her merchandise by taxi, and on average, she works at her business six day of a week, spending ten hours each day.  She cites the high price of goods as her biggest challenge.  Her favorite part of the business is it keeps her busy.\n\nShe will use the loan to purchase more rubber dishes(bowls, plates, spoons, etc)for her business.  \n    \nIn the future, she would like to own a house.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1366136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase more rubber dishes(bowls, plates, spoons, etc)for her business.

However, it is also one of the poorer areas, and housing quality is often very bad. \n\nKadiatu is single and has a three years old child. The child lives at home and goes to school.\n \nKadiatu has a sales table, where she sells foods like bread, sugar, oil and rice.  She has been in business for five years and works nine hours per day. With this loan, she will buy inventory.  One of the greatest challenges that she faces is low income.  She transports her goods by taxi.  She started her business with money from her father.  Kadiatu is proud of her business, because she makes more profit. Her plan is to build a house.  She would like to thank the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

She is married, and her husband works as a security guard.  They live in Nimba County, in Liberia.  Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore.  The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.  As a result, many people on business pass through the area, bringing lots of trade.  It is also the second most populous area in Liberia.\n\nMartha has had her own shop for two years now.  She sells groceries, for example, rice, flour, candy, biscuits and milk.  She works at her business nine hours per day.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is having too few goods in her shop.  She will use the loan to buy more inventory.\n\nShe went to school and finished grade 12. She has a 7-year-old child.  She describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  Martha is proud of her business, because she earns money every day, for her expenses.  She wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

She\u2019s the mother of six children who are attending school and when they get home from school help with field chores since all the farm work is done by the family.  \r\n\r\nShe completed primary school and has more than 15 years\u2019 experience growing corn, beans and coffee; this has been passed down from generation to generation.

Valeri has many loyal customers who trust their cars only to him. \r\n\r\nHis work is hard and requires more time but Valeri never complains.

When he couldn't find anyone, she began to paint, and since then they have been working together.  \r\n\r\nShe and her husband go out to look for customers in various places where their services are needed.

The sites that need them keep getting further away from their home, so they count on having the mobility to transport their tools, such as the soldering machine, the iron cutter, and other tools. It's going very well for them, and they continue to gain customers, which allows them to earn income.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda hopes they will be able to open a shop and increase their earnings so that they can provide job opportunities to other people.

It\u2019s a group that likes to socialize and is noted for the great friendship that exists among them.  The members of the group relate that they chose the name themselves because there was an animal farm called \u201cAltamirano\u201d in the zone where the group first became organized and where they usually met.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel, 40, is a member of the group.  She\u2019s married to Mart\u00edn who works as a field hand and they\u2019ve formed a family together; they have a son who is now attending school.  Isabel is very young but at her young age she works raising and selling pigs.  Isabel commented: \u201cEver since I was a girl my father encouraged me to care for these little animals; he\u2019d tell me that it was a good way to help my husband with household expenses.\u201d  Isabel has been in her activity for three years and she likes it very much, even more so when they are big and she can sell them although one of the difficulties for selling them at a good price is that often the hard work and effort that went into raising them isn\u2019t valued.\r\n\r\nIsabel buys the animals when they are little and cares for them for a few months.  It seems that feed for pigs is very expensive but without it her little piglets won\u2019t be able to grow big and strong.  This time she\u2019s asking for the loan to buy four pigs that she intends to sell whenever her family faces any economic problem like the one they are living through at present: her little boy has a strong eye infection and expenses are greater.\r\n\r\nIsabel commented with a smile: \u201cI\u2019d like to have better quality of life for my little boy so that someday he can have a good job and not suffer from any wants.\u201d  Isabel is sure that she\u2019ll be able to continue raising piglets to help her husband with household expenses.  \r\n\r\nAll the group members are very happy and grateful because each one of them will be able to invest in her business.  Patricia, Jessica, Alberta and Elvira will invest in pigs and Teresa in sheep.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1363827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She previously accessed a 30,000 PHP loan that she used to buy spare parts and accessories as well as for the maintenance of her jeepney unit (the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines). Her earnings were a big help for her children's education and in their personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nLeonora would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and to pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. The profits from her business will help her to sustain her daily needs and pay for her children's education. Leonora looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMs. Leonora hopes to expand her business and dreams of living a good life. She meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n- Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers in helping the Philippines ward off the invading Japanese. Filipinos, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn money and modified the Jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1227220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy spare parts and to pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-06-12T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-12T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

Since 2010 she has been operating her own beauty salon. \r\n\r\nCurrently the beauty stock of the salon is almost finished, therefore Zarqa wants to purchase cosmetic products to continue her business. For that reason, as a member of 2-person borrower group she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase beauty products like facial creams, lipsticks, scrubs, make-up kits, hair colors and some other products. She would also buy some new chairs for her salon.  \r\n\r\nZarqa dreams of llving a happy healthy and peaceful life with her family.

Several times, he requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGivi\u2019s mother is working abroad. She is sending transfers to Givi. Also, he is renting out rooms in his house to get a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nGivi requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Givi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

He lives in Lagodekhi District with his 27-year-old wife and two-year-old daughter. Several times, Bachuki requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBachuki is working as an operator at the local petrol station, on a small, monthly salary. This is the only income for them and it\u2019s rarely enough to feed the family.\r\n\r\nBachuki requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Bachuki has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Bachuki will rent a vineyard. The vineyard that he wants to rent already has grapes growing, so he will not have any extra expenses. Bachuki will harvest grapes and sell them at the local markets, at a good price.

Vakhtang applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Vakhtang has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. With his credit, Vakhtang will buy a milk cow.

Fatima owns a small business that sells facial creams, while her husband works in a small communication engineering shop (mobile phone maintenance and shop, etc.). They both earn barely enough to cover  their own expenses, which is a great obstacle in their desire to provide a good education for their children. In fact, their very low incomes forced their children to drop out of school. Fatima and her husband are waiting for their economic situation to improve in order to enroll their children in school again. She decided to request the loan because she needs to purchase merchandise for her business in order to expand the range of products she offers. <p>\r\n\r\nMona, a 28-year-old married mother of two children, is shown on the far left in the picture. She owns a hairdressing salon, while her husband is a taxi driver. Both her children are enrolled in a private school although they can barely pay for their tuition fees and their monthly expenses. Mona decided to join the Al Samraa group because her sister's wedding is coming up, and she has no means of buying a dress for that cherished event.<p>\r\n\r\nSeated second from the right in the picture is Nohad, a 40-year-old married mother of three children. Nohad owns a small business that sells Lebanese pastry, while her husband has his own winch. Their low income status does not allow them to lead a healthy life with their children. Nohad wishes to purchase an oven, and a mobile phone for her daughter, which is why she decided to request the loan.<p>\r\n\r\nNajah, a 32-year-old married mother of four children and seated second to the left in the picture, works in a small computer shop where her husband is also an employee.  Their combined revenue does not cover their monthly expenses,  and her children are not currently enrolled in school, awaiting an improvement of their parents' financial situation to improve before they go back.

Petrona plans on using the loan to cover the cost of her graduation fees. Often there are fees for earning your title in business before graduating. With a degree in business she expects to earn $10 a day.\n\nShe shares that her alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until she could return.

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Elza will purchase a mini-tractor. Her husband will work on private orders. He will cultivate the neighbors\u2019 land and earn an additional income for the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1365942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

He and his family live with his parents in the Qubadiyon district. Umed is getting ready to start a livestock business. This is the most profitable branch of agriculture in Tajikistan due its natural geography, as 93% of the land consists of mountains and foothills. Qubadiyon is located in the foothills, where there is good pasture land. Umed is planning to buy and sell cattle. Every month he will buy two calves, fatten them up over the course of a month, and then sell them at a profit. He already has a 5x3 meter cowshed and 800 TJS in savings. He has asked for a loan in order to purchase the cattle and feed.
