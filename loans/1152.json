Lia requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nLia\u2019s husband is an artisan. He is working on house renovations for private orders to earn a small income for the family. Their additional income is Lia\u2019s parents-in-law\u2019s monthly pensions. \r\n\r\nLia requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Lia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit Lia will renovate the house in order to rent it out. Surami district is a tourist area in summer. It\u2019s popular for its beautiful nature and fresh air, so a lot of families go there for summer vacations. Lia will have the rooms to rent out and earn a good profit.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1367345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To renovate the house in order to rent it out","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Bughaura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-12T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-12T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613723},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857435},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134083},{"amount":740,"local_amount":740,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":740,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467956863}],"funded_date":"2013-06-26T01:47:23Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:19:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":570002,"name":"Porte\u00f1itas De Lanza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cPORTE\u00d1ITAS DE LANZA\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el segundo ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Copacabana, est\u00e1 compuesta por diez  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Elena es la Presidenta.

With the loan, Eliseo plans on spending the money towards purchasing his textbooks. As an added expense, textbooks are often not bought to save money. With them Eliseo hopes to be able to better understand his subjects.\n\nTo help afford his school and living expenses, Eliseo currently works 30 hours a week as a tailor. One of his biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. Currently Eliseo earns $8 a day. With a degree in business he expects to earn $25 a day.

Guido shares that it is important to him to graduate on time so he can enter into the job market as soon as possible.\n\nWith the loan, Guido plans on using his loan to buy his school books. Up until now he has been managing to get by without them, but it has become a challenge. With books and school supplies he feels he will be able to get better grades.

Unfortunately, Guido's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, his parents never had the chance to move up. Growing up, finances have always been tight.

Often there are fees for earning your title in business before graduating. One of her biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. With a career in business, she expects to earn $20 a day, a substantial increase from before.

Agueda is currently attending the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Caranavi, working towards her degree in business. She plans on graduating in December 2014, but without a loan from Vittana she thinks that she may need to take time off to work and save money until she can return to school.\n\nWith the loan, Agueda plans on purchasing her much needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Agueda feels she will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. One of her biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. With a career in business, she expects to earn $15 a day, a substantial increase from before. With one older sibling Agueda is unsure how she will be able to afford her tuition fees on her own.

To achieve his goal, Santos has enrolled in the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Caranavi. He plans on graduating in December 2013, but without a loan from Vittana he fears that he will need to defer his graduation.\n\nWith the loan, Santos plans to cover the cost of his graduation fees. Often there are fees for earning your title in business before graduating. One of his biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. With a career in business, he expects to earn $15 a day, a substantial increase from before. Santos's parents were never able to complete their primary education.

He lives with his family, which is comprised of his wife and his four children aged 14, 13, 11 and 9 years. Alongside his wife he works very hard in order to get his family ahead and provide them with better living conditions than the ones they had. Thanks to his knowledge of farming he's able to support his household. It's his main source of income, since it's the only way he knows of earning an honest living. With a lot of drive to succeed, he came to this institution in order to request a loan, because sowing season has begun and he needs to start sowing as soon as possible. That's the reason why he requests the loan, since he needs to invest in the purchase of the farming supplies he needs, such as seeds, compost, insecticide, etc., so that he can sow. He has faith in God and in his work, and trusts that this way he'll succeed in reaping a bountiful harvest which will allow him to improve both his and his family's living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1368082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase seeds, compost, insecticide, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Elizandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459010887}],"funded_date":"2013-07-10T02:49:16Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T09:06:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":570466,"name":"Everlyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everlyne is married and has three children, all of whom attend school and are under her care.

In addition to this, he is also an experienced farmer.\r\n\r\nWhat Sirojiddin likes about his business is that it brings an income which allows him to make a living.  His activity also provides his family with milk and dairy products.  His brother and wife help him to run his business, which mostly consists of buying and selling cattle.\r\n\r\nSirojiddin is taking a loan to buy young bulls that he will fatten and resell.

He lives in Marneuli district with his wife, mother, brother and sister in-law. Elshan has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nElshan has a caf\u00e9. He sells cold drinks and beer and earns a small monthly income. His brother is an artisan of metal-plastic doors and windows and works on private orders. \r\n\r\nElshan requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Elshan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision for business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Elshan will purchase products to be able to serve food in his cafe.

She earns her living selling tortillas and running a grocery shop.  She started out just selling tortillas and later began to sell coffee, tortillas and cheese before gradually built up her range of goods until she had a mini grocery shop.  She has now been running the tortilla and grocery business for 7 years and occasionally also sells food as a means of generating additional income.

The couple managed to build their own house from adobe.\r\n\r\nFelix has been growing cacao and other regional produce for the past 35 years.  He has a small, 2 hectare, plot of farmland where he works with his wife and his children who help him with the smaller tasks.  He says that at first it was difficult to make enough money to support his family because he didn't have any land of his own to cultivate and worked on other people's land in his area instead.  Over time, he saved up the money he needed to buy a plot of cacao land at a good price from a friend of his.  With his own plot of land to work, he increased his profits and was able to buy more land.  Every morning Felix heads for his fields together with his wife and sends the kids to school.  He tries to keep his land in good condition, using organic fertilizer to obtain good crops.  He usually sells his produce to local wholesale dealers.

Initially, she had a small plot of agricultural land which she inherited from her parents to support her family financially, since unfortunately, the father of her children left her, leaving her to pay all the household expenses.

She has three children who live with her in a wooden house which was built many years ago.  Maritza and her husband work as farmers, growing regional crops such as organic cacao and coffee.  In the past, Maritza used to sell livestock but she suffered a small accident which stopped her working temporarily.  She used some money that she had been saving up to buy a plot of farmland so that she could attempt to start improving her finances again.  Her work consists of keeping her crops in good condition so that she obtains good-quality harvests.  She normally uses organic fertilizer to increase the quality of her fruit.  She also hires local laborers to get rid of the weeds that grow constantly.  Maritza's work becomes more complicated when the rainy season arrives because she has clay soil and this prevents her from doing her daily tasks normally.  After harvesting her fruits at the end of the season, she dries them and, with the help of a truck, she transports the sacks of cacao to the city where she sells them to local buyers who pay her a good price.  Her main goal is to build her house from bricks and to provide her whole family with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is Maritza's first loan through Kiva.  She feels very grateful for the opportunity she is being given and pledges to make all her loan repayments on time.  She is requesting a loan for 2,500 soles to buy sacks of organic fertilizer with which to fertilize her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1368779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T13:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T13:00:01Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":282.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":286.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":294.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":304.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":317.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":326.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":340.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":348.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.49,"local_amount":282.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":285.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975840},{"amount":105.95,"local_amount":286.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":289.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997108},{"amount":108.82,"local_amount":294.09,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":297.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864578},{"amount":112.75,"local_amount":304.74,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":308.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352946},{"amount":117.42,"local_amount":317.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":321.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904713},{"amount":120.64,"local_amount":326.16,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":330.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090721},{"amount":128.28,"local_amount":346.71,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":350.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777372},{"amount":126.65,"local_amount":342.18,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":346.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450597919}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T12:55:27Z","paid_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":570583,"name":"Samuel Mary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet with this team of primary school teachers from Waterloo, a town in western Sierra Leone near the capital city of Freetown.

She is married with 4 children between the ages of 10 years and 22 years. Three of her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Rugiatu established her pharmacy business. She began her business because she wanted to help her community through medical care. She works at the business 7 days per week and 15 hours per day. She says that the main challenge to her business is the expiration of drugs.\r\n\r\nRugiatu requires a loan in order to buy medicinal drugs. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to take good care of her family. In the future, she plans to build a clinic. She thanks you for your

near Freetown, Sierra Leone\u2019s capital city. This group of teachers is applying for a loan of SLL 11,400,000 from Kiva\u2019s field partner, SMT. School staff and other salaried workers normally come to SMT to apply for loans. \r\n\r\nWith these loans, they are empowered to meet certain financial challenges that they cannot meet, left alone with their salaries. However, with the help of SMT\/Kiva lenders' loans, some of these borrowers will be able to pay school fees for their children, invest in businesses, buy housebuilding materials or pieces of furniture, etc. At the end of each month, their school\u2019s bursar directly deducts their total repayment amounts owed and repays SMT\/Kiva lenders on their behalf.\r\n\r\nThe featured leader of this team is Samuel. Thirty-eight-year-old Samuel is a native of Kalangba village, in northern Sierra Leone. He is a husband to a businesswoman and a father of 6 children, 4 of whom are attending primary school and the others are still not of school-going age.

","en":"Tojiboy is a kindhearted fellow of 44. He is married and has one daughter. He lives with his wife and daughter out in the countryside. He earns a living running his own business. He is very experienced in raising cattle and farming. Most of his income comes from raising and selling livestock. His wife helps him with the business; in the afternoon, she works at a community farm, and in the evening and morning she looks after the animals and milks the cows. Each cow produces 10 liters of milk a day, and his wife sells it to people who live nearby. Along with raising animals, Tojiboy grows crops on a two-square hectare plot of land, and sells the harvest. This business brings him additional income. Now Tojiboy wants to increase his cattle herd to earn a large profit. His daughter is graduating from school and is going to enter the university, so Tojiboy needs money to pay for her education. Therefore he is requesting a loan to buy more cattle so he can resell them later on. Tojiboy thanks Arvand for its support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1361428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

Her husband is working in Russia. Mavluda is a very thoughtful, kind, and decent woman. She helps her husband to support the family. She makes homemade sausage using a recipe her grandmother taught her when she was young, and sells it at the district's main market. She also makes custom-ordered sausage. Even though this business is not very profitable, it is enough for her family and she has no complaints about it. Despite their small income, Mavluda and her husband have already married off their daughter. Mavluda is a young grandmother who babysits and spoils her grandchildren. Her son is studying at college and she needs to buy a computer for him. She also has to pay for his tuition. But she cannot afford it, despite the money that her husband sends to her. So Mavluda has requested a loan from Arvand. She is counting on their support and expresses her thanks in advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1369417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The family resides in their old house on a plot of land. She and her husband have been making interior decoration to entities on contract for about 10 years and have accumulated a vast amount of experience. This year, due to the presidential election, the interior decoration orders are minimal, so they decided to renovate their old house using this spare time. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, they will repair and insulate their old house. As a result, the renovated house will enable the family to reduce their coal consumption and release less pollutants, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

The lady standing second from right with raised hand in the photograph is Sujeshta. She lives with her husband and three sons of twenty-six, twenty and thirteen years of age. She belongs to a poor family. \r\n\r\nSujeshta has been running an ice cream making and vending business with salt, biscuits and detergent powder retailing for the last 15 years. Her husband and two sons manage the business. Her husband goes to a wholesale market 300 kms away once a month to bring the stock of salt, detergent powder and ingredients for ice-cream. \r\n\r\nFrom the above business Sujeshta earns approximately 7000 INR which is not sufficient for her to manage her household expenses along with investment for her business.

Therefore Lalita has requested a loan from Mahashakti Foundation, forming a Joint Liability group with three other women of her locality named Binapani. She will purchase a variety of products including flour, pulses, detergents, oils, etc. to keep up with the increased demand of clients. \r\n\r\nLalita and her husband are very hopeful that the loan will be a lucky and productive one for their family. Lalita hopes to give better education to her sons from her additional income. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Nilendri, Kumari and Kunti,running a cycle repair mart, an auto-rickshaw business and a fabrication center.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1368905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of flour, pulses (lentils), detergents, oils, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilendri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":38000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-15T11:56:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":571267,"name":"Kassipin","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants, Kassipin est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 51 ans et vit avec son \u00e9poux et ses enfants dans la  ville de Koutiala (r\u00e9gion de Sikasso). \nPour des raisons sociales, elle n\u2019a pas eu la chance de continuer les \u00e9tudes primaires, raison pour laquelle elle s\u2019est vite int\u00e9ress\u00e9e aux activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus depuis \u00e0 bas \u00e2ge aupr\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re.

The family resides in their brick house on a small plot of land. Bayarkhurel is an interior decorator by trade and he used to work at a building company. However, he and his wife have been running a pub since 2011 and have now secured many permanent customers. In addition, they have hired two people - a waitress and a cashier.  \r\n\r\nThe house that the family lives in has deteriorated over the years and needs some interior and exterior repair. Thus, Bayarkhurel is requesting a loan of 6,500,000 Mongolian tugriks (MNT) to purchase building and insulation materials such as cement, wallpaper, fiberglass, foam and metal. Using those materials and his professional skills, he will be able to repair and insulate his old brick house, restoring it to its original state. The renovated house will have a positive effect on the environment as the family will burn less coal, and hence release less pollutants into the atmosphere. Bayakhurel is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

She has a son who is nine years old, named Sergio, whom she cares for with great love in a rustic home that she bought 10 years ago. Sarita works in agriculture. Since she was 17 years old, she has worked her parents' farm land and cultivated coffee and plantains. However, she has lived independently for four years with her son, and to do so, she works two crops of coffee and plantains. Through her sales, she is able to ensure her son has a normal education as well as cover important expenses. When her work in the fields is done, she raises pigs because in the jungle, there are not many pig farmers, and the meat from the animals is expensive. It has been two years since she learned this trade: \"My work is going very well for me; I am earning good revenues and investing a little,\" she says. Now she wants to improve her income by increasing production. This is her third loan with Kiva, and thanks to the financial help provided, she is able to continue meeting her goals. She promises to be punctual about making her payments. Sarita will invest the S\/.500 soles in purchasing pigs to grow her

She was born in a rural area that has good conditions for animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops.  Norchon's family was not financially well-off, and she had helped her parents with animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops since childhood.  Norchon survived a lot of difficulties in life because she lived in a poor family.  After finishing school, Norchon got married, but then got divorced four years later and returned to her parents' home with two sons.  Norchon's younger brother and his family lived with her.  Soon, the sons grew up and started to help their mother and uncle.  They were mainly involved in animal husbandry, i.e. bought livestock from a market at low prices, fattened it for a set period of time and resold it at a high price.  Due to bad weather and climate, their business did not produce positive results.  Then, Norchon sent her oldest son to Russia for work.  Norchon has to marry off both of her sons, but first, she needs set up her house for her family.  The sons sent her money this year that they saved for an entire year, but this money to completely rebuild the house was not enough.  This is why Norchon came to IMON to obtain a loan for building a house.  Norchon relies on your charity and mercy.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":1370089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Their living conditions are not very favorable because they live in a mountainous area, but Normahmad tries to provide his children with all of the necessities.  He is involved in his own business in order to have a consistent income in the family.  He has six heads of small livestock.  His wife, Nilufar, helps him with this business.  She is a good helper to her husband and a caring mother to her children.  Also, Normahmad is involved in growing agricultural crops.  Last year, he got a harvest and a decent profit as an additional income.  But because animal husbandry yields his main income, Normahmad wants to expand this business and increase his income to satisfy his family's needs.  This is why he came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy several heads of livestock for subsequent resale.  He relies on the support very much and thanks Arvand in advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1369827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Normahmad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":472.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":483.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":494.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":505.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":517.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":527.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":472.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":517.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":527.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":472.3,"local_amount":472.3,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":472.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673483},{"amount":483.12,"local_amount":483.12,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":483.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144276},{"amount":494.18,"local_amount":494.18,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":494.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960100},{"amount":505.5,"local_amount":505.5,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":505.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180872},{"amount":517.07,"local_amount":517.07,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":517.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875476},{"amount":527.83,"local_amount":527.83,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":527.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302710}],"funded_date":"2013-07-13T18:09:13Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":570718,"name":"Lan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lan is 38 years old.

Now, she wants to start her own business to increase her family's income so that her children won't want for anything.  She is planning to sell children's clothing and has already obtained space (3x5 meters) from which to do so at a local market.  Saodatkhon has savings from the sale of her crops and her husband's income.  For the rest of the money needed, she is asking for a loan.  She is taking out a loan to buy seasonal children's clothing.  She plans to buy the goods wholesale from a market in Dushanbe and sell them at retail in her own region.

He lives with Bertha, his wife of 20 years. Together they have three young children whom they care for in the house he inherited from his parents 20 years ago. When he was a boy, he learned to farm and raise animals. From there, he decided to study agriculture and livestock at a recognized university. His studies were paid for thanks to his work because when he was 16 he started planting all types of crops, such as rice, beets, carrots, cauliflower, artichokes, and broccoli; he specializes in this. He sells the harvest at the city market.\r\n\r\nBut the work he loves most is raising guinea pigs. He has 500 of them. His secret is maintaining their positions; he separates them according to their age and relationships. Every three months, the number of animals grows. The guinea pig feed is mostly alfalfa, which Jesus plants; this is because alfalfa has high nutritional value. People know him, and his customers are constantly ordering guinea pigs to sell or eat.

This is 46-year-old Margaret from Masvingo. She is married and has four children, two of whom are attending school. She also cares for one other dependent. Margaret runs an agricultural business, rearing and selling chickens. The business has been in operation for four years. She says the main challenge being faced is that of a limited market for chickens in the communal areas where she lives. Margaret has applied for a loan of US$300 to buy feed for her chicks. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to increase her disposable income, and thus to improve family welfare.

Taking care of animals requires continuous effort, but his wife helps him to raise the cattle, fatten them, and sell in the market.

He plans to expand the business in order to bring more funds into the family. Selling meat is a very profitable business in Azerbaijan, due the large use of meat in daily meals.

He lives with his wife Antonia, to whom he has been married for 20 years. They have 4 children together, but only 3 live with them. They bought their house 20 years ago. \"The path toward prospering in agriculture is very difficult,\u201d explains Mateo. He has more than 10 years experience in agriculture but he still doesn\u2019t have his own agricultural land. His main goal during this time has been to keep his family in good conditions and provide a good education to his children. This is why, during his free time, he works as a porter, carrying bags of potatoes to different trucks for transport to the markets in the interior of the country.

He fattens them and takes their meat to the central bazaar, where butchers and customers purchase from him. People use mutton for traditional dishes like kababs, dolmas, pilovs, etc.\r\n\r\nHe has taken a loan from Aqroinvest before and has a good loan history. This is going to be his 5th loan. This time he requires 1,900 AZN in order to purchase 12 sheep to sell more meat in the summer.

She is married to Roque, and they live alone in their house made of rustic materials, since their only daughter works independently in a nearby city. In spite of the fact that the farm work is very hard, she does not back down, but on the contrary, she thinks of her goals and exerts herself to do things well. She has worked in agriculture for 20 years. She likes to plant peas and gladiolus flowers for the great economic benefits that they offer her, since they are very sought after in her region. In addition, she loves to raise chickens and guinea pigs. Nevertheless, she dislikes struggling with the weather, which often takes part of her harvests and even led to failure years ago. Fortunately, she now has technical advice to save her production. This is her fifth loan with Kiva, and she feel grateful for the financial support that she receives to continue forward. Irene will invest the 2500 PEN in the purchase of organic compost to feed her plantings, since her goal is to improve the quality of their nourishment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1369547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-14T04:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-14T04:20:05Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":221.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":201.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":230.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":232.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":256.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":266.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":268.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":286.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":296.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.99,"local_amount":221.59,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":226.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975856},{"amount":74.53,"local_amount":201.44,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":205.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997125},{"amount":85.32,"local_amount":230.6,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":235.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864597},{"amount":88.51,"local_amount":239.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":244.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352964},{"amount":86.16,"local_amount":232.85,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":237.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904730},{"amount":95.02,"local_amount":256.81,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":262.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090736},{"amount":98.56,"local_amount":266.38,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":271.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777382},{"amount":314.91,"local_amount":851.12,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":868.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450597935}],"funded_date":"2013-06-14T17:42:09Z","paid_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":570841,"name":"Bassam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bassam is a 31-year-old married father.
