","en":"Mrs, Sanata is about 59 years old. She's married and the mother of six children. She lives in Koutiala with her husband. She never had a chance to attend school, which is why she's been relying on trade since her youngest age.\r\n\r\nShe's been preparing and selling \"Soumbala\" (a condiment made out of beans, widely-used in West Africa). She's very much in demand from her clientele, and gets important orders from many different parts of Mali. Her business is therefore very promising.\r\n\r\nTo increase her working capital in order to meet customer demand and expand her business, she joined Kiva' partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso, eight years ago. She already benefited from group loans (solidarity loans) and is now seeking her sixth personal loan. Previous loans were repaid without problems.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to buy fifteen 100 kg sacks of soy from cereals warehouses in Koutiala. She transforms the soy into \"Soumbala\" that she sells in Koutiala, Bamako and Kayes, for cash and often on credit, to a clientele comprising mostly women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she counts on a monthly profit of XOF 100'000 (ca US$ 200) that she intends to use to repay the loan and help improve her family's standard of living. She will reinvest the remainder in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1370048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married and has five children aged 4, 6, 8, 12 and 17. He has three additional dependents, who live with him because he is helping his nephews with their education.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Abu Bakarr established his used shoes business. He began his business as an expansion of his wife's business. His business is located in the city center, and his main customers are adults. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about 1,063,800 SLL (Sierra Leone leones) every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Abu Bakarr has already received and successfully repaid three loans, and now requires a new loan in order to pay for an additional five bales of men's shoes.

She is single and has two children, ages 13 and 7, both attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fatmata J. established her business selling provisions (e.g., biscuits, cigarettes, drinks, soap, pure water, paste, Ovaltine, mayonnaise, milk). She began her business because she left school, due to mistreatment by her stepmother.  She got into an early marriage and her husband gave her some money to start a business. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about SLL 2,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nFatmata J. would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy batteries, black mint, sweets, mosquito coils, and biscuits.\r\n\r\nFatmata J. was unable to develop her land, but was able to improve her business.

He is 37, married, and has one child, aged 3 years. He has two additional dependents who live with him and help with his business while they attend school. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Bai established his business. Working seven days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about SLL 2,4000,000 every month. One major challenge he faces is the unstable foreign exchange rate.\r\n\r\nBai would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. He requires a loan in order to purchase some pieces of UPS, some hard disk drives, flash drives and A4 paper to sell. This will increase his working capital and he is looking forward to subsequent loans.\r\n\r\nBai used profit from his last loan to support his family by providing livelihood for them.

The house they live in has poorly-constructed walls and windows through which winds and storms seep and chill the family to down to their bones. He is requesting a loan for 7,000,000 MNT to buy a low-pressure heater and building materials such as planks, bricks and cement which he will use to build an extension to his house that will alleviate heat loss and preserve energy.

is a person who is conscientious and hardworking, and she dreams of better living conditions. She is 25 years old. She is married and has three children, aged four, two, and one. She lives in a village and therefore has good conditions for raising livestock. She has been working with livestock for more than ten years. She mainly fattens small-horned livestock.

She takes care of them in the home she inherited from her parents. Ever since she was a child, she dedicated her effort to farming and selling cattle. She mainly grows potatoes, corn, and alfalfa. She says raising animals is profitable because she grows alfalfa and uses it to feed them. She also sells large amounts of alfalfa and distributes it among vendors. Besides selling her cattle, approximately every six months she harvests her products and sells them to her customers. In the future she would like to have a large stable and more land in order to increase her profits. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan opportunity through Kiva. She has always made her payments on time, because she was taught to be responsible and very supportive of her association.

city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. She began working as an accountant right after she graduated from her university. Her husband has been making and selling furniture for four years, and besides this job, he also makes Mongolian traditional gers. The house they live in is made with balks, and over the years, the house quality has deteriorated due to snow and rain. So she is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, they want to encase balk walls with bricks and insulate them with fiberglass. As a result, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, release less pollutants and then contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for better future.

the fall of 2006. As the sole employee of his business, Luis sometimes hires a temporary employee to help out once a month. As technology advances at an extreme pace, he needed to update his equipment. \r\n\r\nAfter he was turned down by a couple of banks, Luis was referred to the non-profit microlender, Accion Texas Inc. Luis then decided he would apply for a $5,450 loan to update his equipment and gain more customers through the better quality of service he will be able to offer. Luis says the loan will allow him to be actively competitive with the other photographers, videographers and DJs in San Juan, Texas. \r\n\r\nWithout the loan, 34-year-old Luis says his business would halt in progression.

My husband works as a security guard, and we have two sons ages 11 and 21.  The oldest is already married.\n\nI started my business 18 years ago - it's a gift shop called Regalos Ruth.  I usually sell in installments, as most of my clients can't afford to pay up front.  They pay me on a weekly basis.  Most of my clients always pay on time and many times they refer me to some of their friends.  I started the business to help my husband when we had two small kids.  With his income alone we couldn't afford our basic needs, so I started selling outside my parents house.  Fortunately sales grew and I was able to rent a small shop space.\n\nMy biggest accomplishment has been to own a house and buy a car.

His home and plot of land are located in a distant area, where there are no industrial enterprises, farmland or apiaries, which makes it a very good place to raise bees. Ashurali has several houses for bees.  He has engaged in this trade before and has good experience. Now, he wants to restart and grow his business.

Rasulov district. Nelufar has been selling vegetables in the central farmer's market for several years. She also has two cows, which she cares for and milks in the morning and evening. Her cows produce ten liters of milk every day and all of her neighbors buy their milk from her. She also makes money selling vegetables during the day, which she buys from another market and then sells at a profit in her village. Her husband is a carpenter who works away from home and sends money to his family when he can. Nelufar is an honest and kind-hearted woman who does everything she can to provide for her children. Nelufar now needs the funds to buy more vegetables. Her neighbors told her about Arvand and she decided to apply for a loan so that she can expand her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1369347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

But, like everything in life, her biggest challenge is to keep her crop clean, free from plagues and diseases which deteriorate the plant and grain like rust.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she needs help buying fertilizers and compost to maintain and strengthen the plant from its root to the grain, obtaining a quality final product.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to expand her coffee crop further, strengthen her plants in order to have an excellent crop and earn income for herself and her family, forming capital which she can re-invest in her crop and leave her commitments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1369669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and compost for her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-06-14T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-14T20:30:08Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delmis Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10132.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504237025}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T05:11:12Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:04:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Alexander","image":1669027}},{"id":571155,"name":"Sitoe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sitoe is 38 years old and married with no children.

His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nMamuka is an instructor. He has a car and he gives private driving lessons to people who want a drivers license. Mamuka earns a small monthly income, which is the only source of living for the family.<p>\r\n\r\nMamuka requested a loan from Credo to start a family business.  He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program involves providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions, to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Mamuka will install the gas system in his car to drive it as taxi.  As gas is much cheaper then petrol, Mamuka will significantly decrease the expenses and increase his profit. He will drive long hours to earn good income for his family.

He lives in a small village Mereti, Gori district with his wife, retired parents and two children (1 and 6 years old). Guram requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family start up business, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities.  In particular, they have a plot of land, where plum and apple trees are grown. Harvested products are sold at the local markets. Family has an additional income from Guram\u2019s parent\u2019s monthly pension.  The family's total monthly income is 425 Gel. This amount is barely enough to feed 6 members family.<p>\r\n\r\nGuram requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program involves providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. <p>\r\n\r\nWith his credit Guram will purchase a milk cow. The cow will be milked every day to produce dairy products. Guram will sell the products at the local market and earn a profit. He is a very hard working man and in the future plans to reinvest the profit in development of the dairy farm by purchasing more milk cows and selling more dairy products. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will give the family an opportunity to cover the food expenses, purchase household items and help improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1367357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To purchase a milk cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Mereti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-14T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-14T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guram ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":119.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134090},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":119.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107678},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":119.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255218},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":119.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019354},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":119.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670480},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":119.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141119},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":119.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467956866},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-19T09:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":119.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479177612},{"amount":50,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490872218}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T07:52:30Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:06:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Bela Vora","image":834828}},{"id":571183,"name":"Leonorica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of five children, Leonorica works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a general store in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from prepaid mobile load.

The group is made up of nine members and is governed by a board of directors. Ines is the President. The businesses run by the group's members are diverse, including stores selling chu\u00f1o (artisanal freeze-dried potato traditionally made in Peru) and mote (boiled corn), a neighborhood store, and sales of salchipapas (fried potatoes with hot dog), wool, clothing, sweaters, and tucumanas (a meat-filled pastry).

She currently owns her own business selling  crocheted goods and sweaters. Ines is married and has five children. She opened this business own her own. She already knew how to crochet, so she turned it into a business. \r\n\r\nThis loan will help Ines by increasing her capital so that she can buy wool from some distributors that she can later use to make goods to sell. This type of work allows her to keep up with her studies. Ines likes working with Pro Mujer because of the health services it offers.

He lives in Akhaltsikhe district with his 41-year-old wife, 23-year-old son and retired parents. Nikoloz requested loans from local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without success. His loan requests were rejected because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nNikoloz\u2019s father is working at the local petrol station and earns a small monthly income. Nikoloz\u2019s parents' monthly pension provides additional income.\r\nNikoloz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Nikoloz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Nikoloz will start trading fruits and vegetables. He used to work in this business before and is very experienced in this field. This will help him to start the new business and make it profitable.

Amiran requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe main source of income for the family is the monthly pension of Amiran\u2019s mother. They also own a small plot of agricultural land where maize and nut trees are grown. The harvested products are mainly used for the family and sometimes sold at the local market. Amiran requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Amiran has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Amiran will open a spare parts shop. He will be selling spare parts and tools for different jobs.

Without the opportunity for a higher degree, his parents never had the chance to move up. Growing up, finances have always been tight. With three older siblings attending college already, Marcos is unsure how he will be able to finance his education without the assistance of a student loan.

He lives in a small village in Vartsikhe, Baghdati district, with his wife and two sons. Levan requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows, which are milked every day to produce dairy products. They also have a vineyard, and with the harvested grapes, they make vodka. All the family members are involved in their agriculture and they work hard to earn a small monthly income. Dairy products and vodka are sold at the local market in Baghdati district. The family's additional income is Levan\u2019s salary. He is an artisan and works on private orders on construction and house renovations. \r\n\r\nLevan requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Levan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Levan will build a greenhouse. He will plant there greens and cucumber. After harvesting the products, they will be sold together with other products at the local market, and the family income will significantly increase. Levan hopes to reinvest the profit in his agriculture, in order to develop it and have a better profit. With the increased profit, Levan will be able to insure a better life for his family.

is 39 years old. She lives in Tsvermaghla village, Ozurgeti district with her husband and retired parents-in-law. Khatuna requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. Her family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have two milk cows and two calves. The cows are milked every day to produce dairy products. The family also owns beehives with bee colonies and a plot of agricultural land, where nut and mandarin trees are grown. All the products are sold at the local market. Khatuna\u2019s husband is working at the local petrol stations as a driver. Her father in-law is also a driver but on a truck for private orders.\r\n \r\nKhatuna requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Khatuna has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Khatuna will rent a commercial space and purchase grocery stock to open a seasonal grocery store. She used to have this business before and is very experienced in this field. Khatuna will purchase seasonal fruits and vegetables at the wholesale price and sell with a price markup from her shop. This will help her to earn an additional income for the family and improve their living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1368658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To rent a commercial space and purchase grocery stock to open a seasonal grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tsvermaghala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T04:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T04:20:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khatuna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":36.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":485.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":345.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":54.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":306.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":312.21},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":69},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":73.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":72.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":77.61},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":528.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":386.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":485.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":528.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":386.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.39,"local_amount":84.39,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":84.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613735},{"amount":485.11,"local_amount":485.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":485.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857447},{"amount":2430.5,"local_amount":2430.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2430.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134096}],"funded_date":"2013-07-06T22:25:05Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":570712,"name":"Mayra Soledad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mayra has always dreamt of becoming a professional.

Marine requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMarine is a seller at the local shop and earns a small monthly income. Her husband, George, is diabetic and gets a monthly pension of 70 Lari from the local government institution. The family's total income is so small that it\u2019s rarely enough for food for them.\r\n\r\nMarine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Marine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Marine will purchase grocery stock to open a grocery shop. She has already rented a small shop at the local market. Marine is very experienced in this field as she has been a seller for many years, and her experience will help the business to be successful. Part of the profit she will be reinvesting in the same field and purchasing more varieties of groceries in order to provide better service for the customers. Another part will be used to cover the family's monthly expenses. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

There is only one source of income in the family and this is not enough to cover the basic needs of the members.\r\n\r\nValentina requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Valentina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit Valentina will open an optical eye-wear shop. She has already found a place to rent and now needs to purchase stocks of products. She will work as a seller herself to decrease the expense of hiring somebody and paying them a salary.

She is 57 years old and lives with her 29-year-old son David and retired mother in-law. Tsitsino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTsitsino is a nurse and she gets a a small monthly salary from working at the local hospital. The family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have a milk cow and a pig. They sell dairy products and piglets. The family also owns a vineyard and plot of land, where nut trees are grown. David harvests the products and sells them together with dairy products and piglets on the local markets to earn a small monthly income. Their additional income comes from Tsitsino\u2019s mother in-law\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n\r\nTsitsino requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tsitsino has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit Tsitsino will purchase 30 sheep. She will start selling lambs and adult sheep at the local market. This will significantly increase the family's income. With the increased income Tsitsino wants to develop her agriculture and earn good profit. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He lives in Zestaponi district with his retired parents. Gocha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. Gocha earns a living from agricultural activities. He has three milk cows and owns a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where vegetables are grown. Gocha has worked in agriculture from a young age alongside his father and is very experienced in this filed. He produces dairy products and sells them together with the harvested grapes and vegetables at the local market. The family's additional income is from Gocha\u2019s parent\u2019s monthly pensions.\r\n \r\nGocha requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Gocha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Gocha will build a greenhouse. He wants to expand his agricultural business and start selling vegetables not only in summer but also in winter. For this reason, he will build a greenhouse and plant different types of vegetables.

Emzar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nHis family owns a plot of agricultural land. Emzar is cultivating the land and planting haricot and potatoes. He is a very hardworking man and after harvesting the products, he sells them among the villagers and at the local market. The family's additional income is Zinaida\u2019s monthly pensions. \r\n \r\nEmzar requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Emzar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Emzar will purchase cheese at the wholesale price.

She has four children and is a farmer. She has been doing this work for three years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"Selling milk in the morning and mid-day\" because she gets cash. Her biggest challenge is \"When there is drought, If I get money, I preserve fodder.\" \r\n\r\nAnimals on the farm have been given names. \"'The goat is called Lydia; the cow is called Meni because of the white forehead.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Interest rate is low.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: \"Developing a savings culture.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Elizabeth replied that when she sells eggs and milk she will be able to have more income and provide food and pay fees.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Elizabeth owns a cow, poultry, and a bicycle but does not own a pig, a pump, a motorcycle or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, solar power, and running water but does not have electricity, a sewing machine, a TV or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1362848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Muranga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T13:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T13:20:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4314.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4428.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4665.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4789.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4915.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5045.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5178.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5315.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5456.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5600.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5748.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.84,"local_amount":8842.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":9092.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820250},{"amount":104.49,"local_amount":8647.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8892.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417330},{"amount":131.8,"local_amount":10907.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11216.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880864},{"amount":61.2,"local_amount":5064.65,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5207.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529492},{"amount":62.82,"local_amount":5198.52,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5345.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753420},{"amount":67.88,"local_amount":5617.97,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5776.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449657883},{"amount":189.97,"local_amount":15721.16,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":16165.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343265}],"funded_date":"2013-06-15T18:24:23Z","paid_date":"2014-03-18T08:48:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":571234,"name":"Marygorret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marygorret has applied for her third loan to finance her poultry business.

their 20-year-old daughter, Nino. \r\n\r\nRoin has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nRoin is working as a driver on a bus line. His wife is a cook at the local bakery. They both earn small monthly salaries, which are the only source of  income for the family.\r\n \r\nRoin requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Roin has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Roin will purchase a car. When he has free time or a day offs from the bus line, Roin wants to earn additional income by driving the car as a taxi. He is a very hardworking man and doesn\u2019t want to waste time. During his free time Roin will earn a good profit by driving locals in the town and will be able to provide for future studying for his daughter. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1370000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To purchase a car and drive it as a taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tbilisi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T13:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T13:40:06Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":139.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":122.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":123.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":132.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":136.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":138.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":141.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":149.32},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":148.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":153.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":155.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":163.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":179.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":182.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":571247,"name":"Basima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Basema is 58 years old.

tobacco. She has three children and has been doing agribusiness for 15 years.  Her primary income sources are eggs, tea, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: The returns she gets from her farm produce enable her to sustain her family. Her biggest challenge is 'Drought,pests and diseases.' Animals on the farm have been given no names.\r\n\r\nJoyce was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Lower interest rate compared to others.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'They offer loans to farmers and repayment are made per monthly instalments.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit her family?' Joyce replied, 'It will enable my children to further their education.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Joyce owns the following: 'poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'cow, pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, electricity, running water, TV' but does not have 'solar power, sewing machine, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1370014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase irrigation equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-15T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-15T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2207.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2265.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2325.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2386.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2449.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2514.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2581.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2649.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2719.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2791.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2865.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2940.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3018.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3098.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.63,"local_amount":2242.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2266.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960577},{"amount":27.34,"local_amount":2301.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820251},{"amount":86.42,"local_amount":7277.41,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":7354.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880865},{"amount":8.97,"local_amount":755.16,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":763.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529493},{"amount":42.16,"local_amount":3550.24,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3587.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449657884},{"amount":168.42,"local_amount":14182.43,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":14332.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570374},{"amount":115.06,"local_amount":9690.14,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":9792.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530053764}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T20:28:10Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T13:30:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":571251,"name":"Al-Akhwh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Al-Akhwh and consists of four women who live in Aden, Yemen.

Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Tamaz will purchase a stock of groceries to fill up his seasonal shop with products.

negocio  Rosa,  una mujer de 19 a\u00f1os que conforma su familia con su c\u00f3nyuge y su peque\u00f1a hija menor de un a\u00f1o. Rosa a principios del a\u00f1o 2012, entusiasmada por su amiga, inici\u00f3 vendiendo mercanc\u00eda variada, que ella le proporcionaba para que generara ingresos, pues Rosa no se encontraba vinculada a ninguna  empresa que entregara cat\u00e1logos a sus compradores, para promocionar sus productos a sus clientes. Poco a poco la clientela de Rosa fue creciendo y esto la ayud\u00f3 a que ella misma, tuviera una vinculaci\u00f3n directa, que  le facilitara comercializar a un precio m\u00e1s competitivo. As\u00ed es como hoy en d\u00eda, ofrece perfumer\u00eda, bolsos, accesorios femeninos, mediante gu\u00edas especializadas de art\u00edculos y de esta oferta escoge las que vienen en promoci\u00f3n, para vender a su clientela a un buen precio y tambi\u00e9n generar m\u00e1s ingresos, con una r\u00e1pida rotaci\u00f3n de sus inventarios. La clientela de Rosa la conforman sus vecinas y referidos por estas, que la apoyan en el crecimiento estructural de su negocio. En la actualidad Rosa est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 cremas, perfumes y accesorios femeninos, que han sido encargados por su clientela; su meta es aumentar el capital de trabajo y as\u00ed mismo las ventas, para mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia. Su mayor desaf\u00edo fue encontrar fuentes de financiamiento y esto es justamente, lo que hace que su credikiva se convierta en un pelda\u00f1o para alcanzar sus sue\u00f1os de prosperidad y se convierta en una inversi\u00f3n exitosa. ","en":"Rosa lives In the Malambo municipality, in the metropolitan area of Barranquilla, where she has her own business. She is a 19-year-old woman whose family is made up of her spouse and their small daughter who is less than a year old. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 2012, Rosa, excited by her friend's support, began selling a variety of commodities that she had shared with her in order to generate income since Rosa was not tied to any business that would give catalogs to its buyers in order to promote their products to their clients. \r\n\r\nLittle by little, Rosa's clientele grew and this helped her to have her own direct tie which helped her sell at more competitive prices. That is why today she offers perfume, purses, and feminine accessories through specialized item guides. From among their offers she chooses those that go on sale, in order to sell to her clients at good prices and also generate more income with a rapid rotation of inventory. \r\n\r\nHer clientele is made up of her neighbors and those referred by them, that support her with the structural growth of her business.

","en":"Qumrinisso is 60 years old and she is a kind and hard-working woman.  She was born and raised in a village, but after she married she moved to the city, where she lives with her family.  Her husband works as a handyman doing home repairs.  For a long time, Qumrinisso stayed at home and raised her children, but now her children are grown and have started families of their own and become independent, she has decided to start a small business.  Following the advice of her friends, she began selling stationery and office supplies.  She enjoys this work very much, as it gives her a good income.  Her suppliers bring her goods at low prices and she sells them at her local market at a markup.  Working for herself makes Qumrinisso feel independent.  She tries to help her children.

His primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, crops and transportation services.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming, to which he replied that is  was being able to provide for his family. His biggest challenges are drought, pest and diseases. Animals on the farm have been given no names.\r\n\r\nWilfred was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: \"Repayment period, which is very convenient.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"Benefits that I will acquire if [I] use the loan effectively.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees.
