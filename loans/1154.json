Juana wants to establish her business by building a local shop.  Having repaid her previous loans, and because her business has grown, Juana is excited to be taking her 9th loan with Esperanza.  She has had her retail clothing and shoe sales business for around five years.\r\n\r\nJuana plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying many dozens of each product in order to sell them to her clients in her community.  She will use the additional profits to save, to supply some of the needs of her children, and for her home.  Juana dreams of becoming professional and having a successful business.  This Esperanza associate began with us to access loans for her business.

She lives and works in Austin. And while for some people, tax preparation may not seem like exciting work, for Debora it has become a calling to help Spanish-speaking immigrants still learning about U.S. financial and taxation systems.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like helping the community,\u201d Debora said. \u201cA lot of people, when they come to me and I explain to them: this number represents your earnings, this and these are your deductions, this is your refund or what you owe, what they tell me is that no one has ever taken the time to explain anything to them. I always try to make sure people understand what they are signing.\u201d \r\n\r\nDebora got the idea to become a tax preparer while she was still working at a bank as a customer service representative. Friends and acquaintances were inquiring about tax filing, so she referred them to her tax preparer, who asked Debora for assistance as an intermediary. \r\n\r\n\u201cI was faxing information to her and relaying information to the tax preparer, going back and forth and I stopped and thought about it,\u201d Debora said. \u201cAnd I decided that I should take some classes and learn more about tax preparation. And I made a determination that this was something I wanted to do. And my business has been growing every year.\u201d\r\n\r\nDebora started work as a tax preparer four years ago, opening D&C Tax Service around the time her second child was born. Becoming her own boss has afforded her more freedom to manage her time and make business decisions than working for a corporation. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf you have a vision in your mind, you can decide for yourself after weighing the good and bad whether to take the risks,\u201d Debora said. \r\n\r\nDebora learned about Accion Texas Inc. when she saw an Accion vehicle in the parking lot of her bank. She went online to learn more and decided to apply for a loan to bring her business to the next level. \r\n\r\nDebora is using her $5,450 loan for working capital, to pay for liability insurance, and professional development and training to gain certification in different areas of taxation, so she can offer new services. She has taken classes to become a notary. She is going to take classes through her professional organization to learn more about how health care reform will have an impact on taxation. She wants to learn more specifics about the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s collections processes. \r\n\r\nDebora said she is looking into the costs and benefits of renting office space and hiring an assistant. For the moment, she said her tax preparation service offers her the opportunity to work from home and to help the community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5450,"image":{"id":1370342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

before he crossed the border to neighboring Brownsville 12 years ago to unite with his wife and children, all American citizens. When Ricardo first moved to Brownsville, he worked at a car wash, and later for a construction company.\r\n\r\nIt was while Ricardo was working for a construction company that he got the idea to combine the knowledge that he gained when he owned the car wash in Mexico with what he learned working in construction to form a new company: A. Professional Power Wash. \r\n\r\n\u201cI learned that there was a big need for maintaining parking lots,\u201d Ricardo said. \u201cSo I decided to start this business three years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicardo and his six part-time employees power wash the blacktops of parking lots and other asphalt surfaces, apply the black sealant to protect the asphalt, and paint the stripes on the surface to create parking spaces or traffic stripes.\r\n\r\nAfter three years, Ricardo said his business is thriving, but he hopes to grow his business and to employ more people. \r\n\r\nAn acquaintance of his \u2013 another business owner in the construction business \u2013  told him about Accion Texas Inc., saying that borrowing money to finance his growth plans would help him build his credit. \r\n\r\n\u201cHe said that in the United States, you borrow money to help build your credit and to help your business grow,\u201d Ricardo said. \u201cSo I found Accion and I applied for a loan. And I am so glad that there are people like your company to help business owners like me.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicardo said his experience with Accion was very enlightening and helped him to learn more about credit in the United States. He is using his $5,450 loan to buy supplies for his business and to pay for expenses related to marketing. Ricardo said his business has grown mostly through referrals. He is hoping with brochures describing his services, he will more quickly be able to grow his business.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am doing a presentation with a business that has stores all over Texas and they are looking for someone to take care of all the stores in the Valley,\u201d Ricardo said. \u201cI think they will accept my proposal because I am providing a good service at a good price. And I think if I get this contract, my business will double and I can double the number of employees that I have.\u201d"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1370403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Su meta es lograr la sostenibilidad de su negocio, para dedicarse solamente a \u00e9l, pero su mayor desaf\u00edo es tener el suficiente capital de trabajo, para aumentar su oferta de servicios teniendo un mayor n\u00famero de maquinaria, con el fin de obtener mayores utilidades.

","en":"Everlides is 41 years old. She lives in the south of the city where she earns a living by offering washing machine rental services, domestic services and other commercial services that allow her to supplement her income, meet her expenses, and raise the standard of living for her 14 year old daughter who she dreams will grow up to be a successful professional. She began this work in 1999 and from this point on she has gained experience, little by little. She works from 7 in the morning to 6 in the evening. Her goal is to ensure her washing business is sustainable, so that she dedicate all of her time to it. However, her biggest challenge is maintaining sufficient working capital to increase the services she offers by having more machines with the goal of obtaining greater profits. Today, Everlides is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With this loan she will buy two washing machines for clothes and begin to complete her dream of prosperity--to simply increase her profits and ensure that her investments are successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1370335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy two washing machines for clothes.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-06-16T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-16T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlides ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":730000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62820},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":67124},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":68691},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70293},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":71934},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":73612},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":75330},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":77087},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":78886},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":84223}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.42,"local_amount":62820,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":65624.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968348},{"amount":36.78,"local_amount":67124,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":70120.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817524},{"amount":37.64,"local_amount":68691,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":71757.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323800},{"amount":38.52,"local_amount":70293,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:51:03Z","rounded_local_amount":73430.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083029},{"amount":39.41,"local_amount":71934,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":75145.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062381},{"amount":40.34,"local_amount":73612,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":76898.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732079},{"amount":41.28,"local_amount":75330,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":78692.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415303},{"amount":42.24,"local_amount":77087,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":80528.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104451},{"amount":89.37,"local_amount":163109,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-26T08:50:42Z","rounded_local_amount":170390.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919364}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T21:53:40Z","paid_date":"2014-04-26T08:50:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Hildreth","image":null}},{"id":571654,"name":"3.6.293.5.thi\u1ec7u Nguy\u00ean Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H\u1eb1ng is 29 years old and married with two children.

They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known from their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

His wife is a manager, and his son is a sentry at a police department. Using his previous loan, he renovated his house, but some parts of the house are still vulnerable to rain, snow, storms, and frosts. He is requesting a loan of MNT 6,000,000 to buy vacuum-insulated windows, hardwood floors, and shingles for the roof. After installing vacuum windows, hardwood floors, and shingles, the heat loss through the windows, floors, and roof will decrease, and the family will begin to burn less coal. This will reduce the pollutant release into the atmosphere. The borrower is a very hardworking person who strives for a better future.

When asked \"How will this loan benefit your family?\" Winny replied that she will educate her children better.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Winny owns a cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure how this loan changes the borrower's standard of living.

They own a small plot of land, where vegetables are grown. Harvested products are used by the family and sold at the local market. \r\nLena requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Lena has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit Lena will start trading clothes from Turkey. She will go there to purchase products at the wholesale price, bring it to her district, and sell with the price markup among the villagers.

She married at age 18, gave birth to her four children at home, and was widowed at age 30. While her husband was alive, she tended to the household chores; however, after he died, she worked outside her home, washing and ironing, so that she could raise her children. \r\n\r\nBeing both mother and father and experiencing the bad luck of having her house destroyed by rains, she decided to apply for a loan. She used the loan to buy clothing to resell as a street vendor, work she has done now for 18 years. She continued renting with her children and slowly saving to build a new house, where she decided to set up a store and sell basic household items. She also sold coconut preserve as she traveled around selling clothing.

Mary owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, which is milked every day to produce cheese. Also they own a plot of land, where haricot and maize are grown. Beka is a very hardworking man and he is trying his best to ensure a proper life for his family. He harvests the products and sells them together with dairy products at the local markets. Their additional income is Beka\u2019s mother-in-law's monthly pension. Also Beka recently opened a metal and plastic doors and windows workshop and earns a small income from it. \r\n\r\nBeka requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Beka has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Beka will purchase raw materials for his newly opened workshop. After having more materials to work on, Beka will be able to get more private orders. He will work hard and long hours to satisfy client needs and try to expand his business. For this he will reinvest part of the profit.  Another part of the profit will used for purchasing all the needed household goods for his family to provide better living conditions for them.

His oldest son is working abroad in Russia. His youngest is still in school, but always helps his parents with household work. \r\n\r\nMalik has been working with Arvand for over three years. When he first approached the Arvand organization, he only had one cow. After receiving a loan, he purchased another cow, a bull, and 10 sheep and goats. Thanks to Arvand, he significantly grew his business and improved his living conditions.\r\n\r\nNow, Malik wants to purchase calves, raise them until winter, and sell them for a profit.

","en":"This is the \"Madres Coraje (Courageous Mothers)\" group, formed of five members. The large majority of them are neighbors in the area and going through their fourth loan cycle. This group has demonstrated honesty and solidarity among the members. Maria Teresa, 33 years old, is separated with one son, who has been her motivation for moving upward and onward. Maria Teresa started selling beauty products with the goal of moving up. Maria Teresa decided to start her new business where she now provides construction materials.\r\n\r\nThe revenues that she earns are used for groceries and for her son's education. With the loan that she requested, she will purchase construction materials such as nails, metals, and paintbrushes. Later, she is thinking of opening a restaurant, and she says she will have better earnings. The Madres Coraje group is grateful for the loan provided because it makes their progress possible. Maria Teresa is the second from the right (in the photo), seen wearing the black sweater and brown polo shirt. We see her accompanied by her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1370504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

Mary has sold tacos for 16 years. She says that she started because a family member of her husband's has a restaurant-bar, but after time left the business, so Mary's husband took over the business of selling the tacos. Mary, such a sweetie, says thanks to the loan, she was able to buy eight pigs to raise and fatten, but she also bought bags of food for her pigs. Mary is very grateful for the loan because she already has her piglets.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty that Mary is facing is that she does not have the money to purchase large quantities of food for her little pigs because she says, \"If the food were cheaper, I would have the same pigs that I had before.\" Mary came to have 60 piglets just for fattening, but the price of the food has gone up by a lot, and she believes she won't be able to care for all of them. The piglets that she bought will grow and get fat in just four months, and after this time, she thinks she will sell them in her fast food stalls as meat tacos. Mary has three taco stands in the town. Mary said that \"Only in this situation, I dream of having my own business in my home where we won't live with such worry,\" because the places where she has her stands are not her own, and she lives worried because some day they will be taken from

He purchases 9 steers at a time, and, after fattening them up for two months, sells them at the market for profit. He uses the money he makes for family expenses.

When harvest time comes around, he hires local labourers and a vehicle to transport his sacks containing dry beans from the countryside to the city, where purchasers of these products pay him good prices.\r\n\r\nHe wishes to work with his characteristic motivation so he can buy his own transport and reduce transportation costs, hoping in this way to increase his earnings. This is his second loan with Kiva and he feels extremely grateful for the financial support he receives to succeed. On this occasion, he wishes to buy 100 nursery plants to replace the old cocoa trees on his land, to ensure a higher yield during the next season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1371216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de plantas de alm\u00e1cigo.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-17T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-17T13:50:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adrian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":102.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":99.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":116.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":122.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":127.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.5,"local_amount":94.66,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":97.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975862},{"amount":38.46,"local_amount":102.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":105.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997134},{"amount":37.2,"local_amount":99.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":101.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864605},{"amount":40.96,"local_amount":109.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":112.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352971},{"amount":40.42,"local_amount":107.81,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":110.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904738},{"amount":43.64,"local_amount":116.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":119.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090742},{"amount":45.06,"local_amount":120.18,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":123.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777390},{"amount":51.09,"local_amount":136.25,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":139.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450597944},{"amount":42.67,"local_amount":113.77,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-15T12:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":116.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147275}],"funded_date":"2013-06-19T22:30:48Z","paid_date":"2014-05-15T12:13:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":571876,"name":"Wily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wily is 41 years old and married with three school-aged children.

He has six children and has been doing this work (farming) for five years.

Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Bois.'\r\n\r\nSigei was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Because of their good grace period.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'It gives loans in groups.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is family expenses.
