At the moment, she lives in an adobe house, which she bought some years ago with the fruits of her hard work. She has made a living in agriculture for over 19 years, on a 19 hectare plot of land on which she grows some of the profitable products such as cocoa, coffee, peanuts, and other items. She is supported by her husband, who works every day on their agricultural land. She has more cocoa plantations because it is a product which only needs to be kept weed-free and its pods fed with organic compost to get a good result.

She is married and has three children.  She was not able to get into a university after completing school due to financial difficulties.  But Firuza has had a love for sewing since childhood.  She liked very much to observe how her grandmother sewed national dresses.  And when Firuza grew up, her grandmother gave her her sewing machine.  Gradually, Firuza learned how to sew national dresses.  Now she is a professional seamstress.  She has a lot of clients.  This is how Firuza earns her living now.  Firuza's sewing machine has gotten old and often breaks down.  This is why she wants to buy a new sewing machine, but she does not have enough money to buy one.  Hence, Firuza decided to come to the Arvand organization for a loan.  She hopes very much that Arvand will help her and offer financial support.\r\n

The group leader is 31 years old and she is engaged to be married soon.\r\n\r\nWith limited career options, due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, she is one of the many Iraqi women who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has three years' experience working with her small, home-based sewing and tailoring business activity. She would like to offer her customers more options and a variety of creative designs to choose from and would like to buy an over-lock machine and an embroidery machine, as well as some nice quality fabrics and raw materials. To be able to make these purchases and make nicer dresses for women and children, she took a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq offers 'group loans' for clients unable to provide a guarantor, thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Her home neighbors Mount Kenya, one of Kenya's main water sources. Like her neighbors, she has been affected by weather changes and a decrease in water supply due to the increasing deforestation around Mount Kenya. Being a farmer this has affected her crop production, which is her main source of income. Sarah uses charcoal and firewood for cooking and kerosene for lighting because there is no electricity connection in her home. Every month she spends approximately $35 without counting the time and energy used to collect firewood. She and her two daughters are also at risk of sexual harassment from forest guards when they go to collect wood. \n\nTo save her from all these challenges, the Visionary Empowerment Programme team encouraged her to construct a biodigester, as she has four cows from which she can get fuel for cooking. VEP also sold her a solar package so she can have sufficient light to enable her four children to study in the evening without limitations. \n\nSerah is now an empowered woman and will educate others in her village to embrace green energy as well. With her savings and income from the sale of milk and maize she will comfortably repay the loan.

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Microfinance is the most convenient way to borrow for low earners.'\r\n\r\nCaroline's highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'how will this loan benefit her family?', Caroline replied 'I will educate my child.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Caroline owns the following: a cow, poultry and a bicycle but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, solar power, running water and a TV but does not have electricity, a sewing machine or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1371074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rabbits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-17T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-17T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.96,"local_amount":2157,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2302.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960589},{"amount":27.68,"local_amount":2214.02,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2363.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820260},{"amount":56.81,"local_amount":4545.08,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4851.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880883},{"amount":59.82,"local_amount":4785.36,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5108.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529506},{"amount":26.1,"local_amount":2088.36,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2229.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449657902},{"amount":35,"local_amount":2799.75,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2988.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343278},{"amount":36.61,"local_amount":2928.81,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3126.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467943843},{"amount":81.5,"local_amount":6519.94,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6960.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859464},{"amount":24.52,"local_amount":1956.78,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2088.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287621}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T21:45:26Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T14:39:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane  Slocombe","image":null}},{"id":572142,"name":"Enriqueta America","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Enriqueta de 43 a\u00f1os de edad es muy amable y trabajadora, vive con su esposo  y sus tres hijos, Ella trabaja muy duro en su propia parcela donde siembra maiz y frijol;

is a single mother of two girls in secondary school living in Kirinyaga county in central Kenya. She has a coffee and tea farm and also practices dairy farming. She has three cows from which she sells around 20 liters of milk per day. \n\nHer farm income is used for her children's school fees and for their daily needs. Because she does not have electricity at home, she uses kerosene for light and firewood and charcoal for cooking. These fuel expenses cost her approximately $57 per month.\n\nTo save her this amount of money, VEP recommended that she install a biodigester at her home. The biodigester will produce gas that she will use for cooking and lighting. After receiving training, she took a loan, and a biodigester is now under construction at her home.\n\nGladys and her family will have a better life free from the drudgery of collecting firewood and using smoky kitchens.

He lives in the small village of Gurjaani District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and grandson. <p>\r\n\r\nOn several occasions, Goderdzi requested loans from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, each time without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nGoderdzi works as an artisan and earns a modest monthly income. His wife works locally as a baker. Their earnings provide hardly enough income to purchase food for the family. According to Credo estimates, their family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nGoderdzi requested a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Goderdzi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with lenient conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

Her loan requests were rejected every time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is her husband's and son's monthly salaries. Both of them work as salesmen. But their earnings provide hardly enough income to put food on the table for the family. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Nino has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with lenient conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high-risk borrowers because of their low incomes. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan proceeds that she is requesting, Nino would like to begin trading used clothing. Specifically, she plans to purchase used clothing from the wholesalers in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, and to then re-sell such clothing in Gurjaani at higher prices.  She believes that, by doing so, she will increase her family's income. And in this way, she feels that the new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1371127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to begin buying and selling used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gurjaani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-17T21:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-17T21:40:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nino","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":37.3},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":39.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.7,"local_amount":29.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":29.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613749},{"amount":33.47,"local_amount":33.47,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":33.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857461},{"amount":34.33,"local_amount":34.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":34.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134111},{"amount":35.51,"local_amount":35.51,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107698},{"amount":36.14,"local_amount":36.14,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255236},{"amount":280.85,"local_amount":280.85,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":280.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019372}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T01:09:21Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":571438,"name":"Camilo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Camilo de 48 a\u00f1os de edad, habita al sur de la ciudad con su c\u00f3nyuge y su hija de 24 a\u00f1os.

He lives in a secluded area, blessed with beautiful landscapes as well as rich soils. He started his path on agriculture since he was very young, taking advantage of the good quality if the lands. He presently counts on a 5-years\u2019 experience in planting broad beans, peas, potatoes and corn; he cares for his crops constantly because they need the proper nourishment to obtain good quality products. Being able to watch products growth on his land is what he mostly likes about his job; what he doesn't like are the constant changes in market prices, as at times he doesn\u2019t know whether he will earn a good income. However, this does not discourage him because on top of counting on fixed customers in the wholesalers\u2019 market of his town, he has also started breeding small animals such as pigs and chickens, which he sells for a good price after having fattened them. F\u00e9lix will invest the 2500 PEN in the purchase of manure to feed his crops.

He later worked as a salesman for some years; he saved his salary and used it to establish a boutique business which he has now changed to a bar.  Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,585,000 every month from this business. Inadequate capital is his major challenge. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan of Le 4,000,000. Ibrahim would use the loan to buy different kinds of drinks - soft, energy and hard drinks. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Ibrahim plans to develop the bar into a guest house, educate his children, and build a house.  This house will help achieve some of his future plans.  \r\n\r\nHe thanks you for your support, and for financing his business.

His father farmed South Texas land. Gerardo ventured off to try other work, but came back to the family business. While Gerardo\u2019s father worked for other farmers, Gerardo wanted to be his own boss. \n\n\u201cI had a little money saved up and I started buying equipment little by little,\u201d Gerardo said. \u201cEvery year, I would get equipment and make payments on my equipment. It\u2019s been a struggle in the past few years, though.\u201d \n\nTo sustain his family and himself, Gerardo works full-time in an office, but he farms when he\u2019s not working in the office. Gerardo currently has a crop of alfalfa. In the past, he grew livestock grass. And before the drought, one of his most profitable crops was chili peppers.  \n\nAt the start of the recession, Gerardo did well investing in a versatile and powerful John Deere tractor that could plow, chisel and level land. Small farmers passing by his 52-acre plot saw him leveling land with ease and asked him to do the same with their land. There were so many requests that leveling land became a significant source of income for his company, A. Custom Work. \n\nBut when Texas got hit with the worst single year drought in history in 2011, Gerardo said as land in South Texas cracked and parched up, his business dried up too. And when the drought continued in 2012 and was sustained through 2013, Gerardo said he faced losing his tractor.\n \nWhile attending a workshop with the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension in El Paso, Gerardo met a loan officer from Accion Texas Inc., who advised him on how to refinance the loan into smaller more affordable payments. Using his John Deere swather as collateral, Gerardo obtained a $5,625 loan from Accion to pay off his tractor.\n\n\u201cI probably would have lost my tractor if I hadn\u2019t gotten this loan from Accion Texas,\u201d Gerardo said. \n\nGerardo is toughing out the drought because farming is a way of life and a family tradition. When the drought clears up, he hopes to start growing chili again.\n\n\u201cMy plan is to learn ways to improve myself,\u201d Gerardo said. \u201cWe are all hoping the water situation improves, too.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5404.19,"image":{"id":1365669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

 A Vietnam and Desert Storm veteran who retired from the military in 2004, Charley taught in the Houston school district when he returned home and soon after began working for large construction companies and as an independent contractor. \r\n\r\nCharley later moved to Dallas to continue to serve his country, working for L-3, a company that works to enhance government intelligence and security. Charley works overnight specifically with black boxes, which hold recorded information about airplane performance parameters. During the day, Charley continues what he learned from his father as a carpenter creating wooden furniture to sell.  He plans on using the funds to help him with start-up costs, lumber purchases and to cover the costs of a specialty woodworking course.\r\n\r\nBefore getting a loan from Accion Texas Inc., Charley had already invested more than $1,500 for a banner, tools and equipment that he needs for his business, and he has secured a site to sell at the First Monday Market Place in Canton, Texas. To improve the amount of items he has to offer, Charley is using his loan to take that specialty class with his wife, who will cover the stand while he is working. The class will also provide Charley and his wife with additional equipment and wood to jumpstart his business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5226.2,"image":{"id":1371374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

facilities as a side job. Born and raised in Carrollton, Texas, just northwest of Dallas, Jose is familiar with the hustle and bustle of city life and excited about officially working as owner of his self-titled cleaning business.\r\n\r\nWhile listening to the radio one day, he learned about Accion Texas Inc. and all the organization can do to help him start his own business.  He quickly inquired about applying for a loan, and after he submitted his application, was approved for a loan. Jose understands that his Accion loan will provide more business as the van he purchased with it will help expand his clientele. He works alone at the moment but would like to hire a full-time and one part-time employee in the near future.  \r\n\r\nWithout the Accion loan, Jose could not have started his cleaning business as quickly.  He continues to work with his current clients and plans to obtain other clients to increase

","en":"Diana, 38, has a sewing business and sells pijamas, hats, scarves and gloves.  She lives in the beautiful capital city of Colombia, Bogot\u00e1, with her husband and 13-year-old son.  For four years she has been making pijamas in response to the demand by customers who, when visiting her business, would ask if she sold pijamas.  Diana saw an opportunity to expand business, increase her income and contribute more to the household economy in an effort to improve the family's lifestyle.\r\n\r\nHer manufacturing process begins with the purchase of fabric and supplies such as buttons and thread; then she designs, cuts, sews, packages and puts her products up for sale.

In this way, he can sell his hogs for a greater price enabling him to support his children's education, improve their standard of living and save some of their income for future use.

She sells dyed bazin for cash and on credit, both from home and as a travelling vendor, to her customers in the local neighbourhood, the majority of whom are women. \r\n\r\nRokia hopes that with this loan she can make an average of 40 000 CFA francs per month, which she will use to reinvest in the business and buy additional food supplies for her household. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1371878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy bazin cloth and dyes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-06-18T09:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia                           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa   Moumouni               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":308.33,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":151457.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678666},{"amount":308.34,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":151457.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924280},{"amount":308.33,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":151457.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207469},{"amount":308.33,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":151457.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972137},{"amount":308.34,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":151457.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972138},{"amount":308.33,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":151457.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624734}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T12:05:35Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lucy  Knight","image":null}},{"id":572308,"name":"Cheourn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cheourn is 61 years old and married.

After she completed her MBA program, she knew this was exactly the kind of product she wanted to create, and Real Natural Beauty was born with a mission to provide quality mineral and organic makeup designed for the multicultural woman.  \r\n\r\nDenise\u2019s primary goal for her business is to create a change in how we see ourselves and others. She believes strongly in the importance of self-confidence and strives to empower young women through her volunteer work and her business. As a volunteer with several middle school after-school and Young Life programs, Denise inspires and motivates young girls to realize their natural beauty, helping them discover that true beauty comes from within. \r\n\r\nStarting her business just last January, Denise has already experienced and overcome several challenges. One major challenge was finding local chemists, or makeup mixers, that could produce the unique color combinations needed to match and enhance the skin tones of her target market.  Through this whole process she has tried to work locally in every part of her manufacturing process, as partnering with local businesses is intrinsic to Denise\u2019s business model.\r\n\r\nHer $8,500 Kiva loan will enable Denise to pay for her start-up inventory and strategic marketing. Your help will also enable Denise to continue reaching out and empowering women to embrace their unique natural beauty.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Denise hopes to develop innovative initiatives to empower women internationally, working with local and international organizations geared towards women and child development.

He needs additional capital for the growth of his business. For that his wife, Razia, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. With the loan money, her husband can buy a variety of goods for his general store like flour, sugar, pulses and detergent to satisfy his clients more professionally, as well as to increase his net income.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNodari works as a fitter at a local cable TV company, and his mother works as a baker locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNodari requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Nodari has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Nodari will open a bakery. After the bakery is opened, they will be able to bake Georgian bread for selling. As his mother has a rich experience in this field, Nodari thinks that the business will be profitable. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Channy is a first cycle client with VisionFund. She is leading her group of five to apply for a loan of 170,000 KHR each. As the leader, Channy will use her portion to buy materials to build a decent latrine, including a latrine bowl, tile draining and sewage. She hopes this loan will enable the family to have a healthy latrine, so as to improve the family's standard of

He is well-known in the area where he lives because of his humility and his dedication to his work. He has never allowed himself to be defeated and he has always moved forward with his difficulties. With effort and dedication, he has a store in which he sells basic goods, like basic grains, milk, eggs, and rice, among other things. He is very dedicated to his work and very attentive when he sells. This is why he has customers who seek him out and prefer him because of his products. He needs to stock his store a little more due to increased demand and he doesn't have the capital to do it. This is why the client is applying for a loan to buy more products like basic grains, instant goods, candies, drinks, etc. He trusts in God that the help he has asked for will be delivered soon, and he will not have any more worries about bringing home the daily bread."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1371440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her husband wants to purchase a variety of ready-made dresses for his business so that he can increase his income. Due to a lack of finances, he finds this difficult. Therefore Kousar has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase ready-made garments such as jeans, shirts, pants, belts, etc. for her husband's shop. She is hopeful that the loan will be a productive one for the business. With the profits expected from this loan, Kousar intends to buy a new refrigerator for food preservation.

His biggest challenge is 'controlling  pests.' Animals on the farm have been given no names.\r\n\r\nSammy was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'they support farmers.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'saving money.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is transportation costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Sammy replied, 'he will be able to supply his produce on time.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Sammy owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, electricity, solar power, TV' but does not have 'running water, sewing machine, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

Through this work she is able to support her family and give them everything they need, so that they don't have to experience any privations such as those she had to experience. \r\n\r\nShe is applying for this loan in order to buy thread, needles, and other supplies so that she can continue making her hammocks and other crafts. She is grateful for the help that she and her friends are receiving, as it will allow each of them to grow in their respective businesses.

She is a dekhan farmer, who grows potatoes and then sells the harvest and earns a good income.  She has her own land for planting potatoes; the size of the land is 1 hectare.  Zulfira's husband helps her with this business.  When it is time to gather and sell the harvest, he organizes this work.  They also raise livestock to earn additional income.  They have several heads of livestock.  Zulfira milks the cow by herself in the mornings and sells the milk to her neighbors.  At the present time, Zulfira and her husband want to increase their income because they dream of having a child in the near future and need to set up favorable conditions in their home.  This is why they want to increase the volume of their harvest and need money to purchase seeds for planting potatoes.

Mongolia. They reside in their own house on a plot of land. She has been working as a noodle packer at a noodle factory since 2011. Her son goes to high school and is currently in seventh grade. She divorced her husband seven years ago. The house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and needs some serious repair. She is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, fiberglass, foam, and planks. As a result, she and her son can live in a comfortable and warm house after repairing and insulating their house using those materials. The renovated house will reduce their coal consumption and release fewer pollutants into the air, contributing to efforts to reduce air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.
