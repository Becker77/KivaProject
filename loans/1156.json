Soledad was accepted into Escuela Superior Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and now with the chance to achieve her dream is concerned about affording tuition fees. She expects to graduate in December 2014, but without a loan is unsure how she will be able to continue affording her education. Her alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until she could return. It is important to her to graduate on time so she can enter into the job market as soon as possible.\n\nWith the loan, Soledad plans on purchasing much needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Soledad feels she will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. With a degree in business she expects to earn $10 a day. With one younger sister, Soledad hopes to be a role model for her younger siblings by being the first in her family to graduate from university.\n\nThis loan is administered by Vittana's partner Banco

is Rahiema, 33, a resident of Taguig, Philippines. She is single and lives with her parents, helping them manage their household. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRahiema operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php16,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRahiema hopes that her variety store becomes a grocery store.

He lives in a small village, Tkemlovana, in Chiatura district, with his retired parents and two children (13 and 15 years old). Several times, Koba requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nKoba's family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have milk cows, bulls, two pigs, and a plot of land where haricot and maize are grown. The cows are milked every day to produce dairy products. Harvested products, along with the dairy products, are sold among the villagers. Koba also has a small grocery shop and he earns a daily income.  The family's additional income is from Koba\u2019s parents' monthly pensions. \r\n\r\nKoba requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Koba has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Koba will purchase a mini-bus. He wants to start trading in fruits and vegetables. Since his village is far from the city center and it\u2019s hard for the locals to access certain products, Koba, with his mini bus, will go to the big market in Chiatura district, purchase fruits, vegetables, and other products, and bring them to his village to resell to the villagers. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Koba will help his villagers and will also have increased the income of his family.

Givi lives in Gardabani district with his wife, his 26-year-old son and 22-year-old daughter. Givi has requested for a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. Givi works at the local furniture workshop as a security guard and his son works at the Tbilisi National Airport as a cleaner. They both earn small monthly salaries, and this is the only source of living for their family.\r\n\r\nGivi requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Givi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Givi will pay the customs fees for his car. Givi wants to start trading in cheese. He will purchase the products at a wholesale price and resell with a price markup. He will earn a good profit with his new business and will be able to improve the family living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1371739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to pay the customs fees for his car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Sartichala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-18T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-18T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Givi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":111.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":119.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":123.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":126.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":130.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":134.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":138.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.39,"local_amount":111.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":114.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613753},{"amount":72.6,"local_amount":116.16,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":120.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857465},{"amount":74.72,"local_amount":119.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":123.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134115},{"amount":408.29,"local_amount":653.26,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":676.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107702}],"funded_date":"2013-06-20T21:11:28Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kavita Shah","image":780734}},{"id":572876,"name":"Roxanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roxanna is 23 years old and married.

began displaying art for the citizens of Knoxville, Tennessee more than seven months ago.  Sherry\u2019s goal was to enable visitors to not only understand the art displayed, but also to generate group discussions about the pieces.  Sherry believes bringing culture into one\u2019s valuable leisure time is both beneficial and supports the initiative of the Nuance gallery\u2014hence her business name, Gallery Nuance. \n\nSherry discovered Accion Texas Inc. at an external workshop and inquired about applying for a loan for the gallery.  After applying and receiving her Accion loan, she was able to replace and purchase updated track lighting for the gallery.  The lighting within the gallery is critical to showcase the art and emphasize its beauty.  Sherry would not have been able to replace the existing track lighting without her Accion loan she says.  \n\nSherry will continue to provide a friendly team environment that together learn about each other and gain access to art and culture.

So, Otgontuya is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials, such as wallpaper, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, she will repair and insulate her own apartment. As a result, the apartment will no longer lose its heat through walls and windows, thus preserving energy. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1371799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

children each. They all live in polygamous families in Bougoula, one of the villages of the Sanankoroba commune (second administrative region of Mali).\r\n\r\nThey have joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to successfully carry out their farming activities during the rainy season. They are on their fifth loan with the institution and their previous loans have been duly repaid.\r\n\r\nThe featured borrower, Aminata, grows okra. In the photo, she is in the sitting row, third from the left. She plans to use her loan to buy agricultural inputs and seeds and to pay for the cost of plowing to cultivate 0.5 hectare (1.23 acre) of land.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest, she sells her crop to both consumers and resellers, in her village and at the Bougoula market.\r\n\r\nShe is expecting to make a profit of 25,000 CFA francs at the end of the season. This profit will allow her to repay her loan and to help her husband cover the daily expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1373018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to cover the cost of plowing and to buy seeds and agricultural inputs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougoula","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-06-19T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-19T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata   D         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                 Bakary               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayouma            T                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam            Soliba                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata   Bakary                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou                                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata  B                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":715000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":715000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1475,"local_amount":715000,"processed_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":725828.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850754}],"funded_date":"2013-06-20T17:58:20Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":573357,"name":"Las Manzanas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ten very sympathetic and cheerful women belong to the \"Las Manzanas\" (the apples) group. They are located in a small neighborhood called Panim\u00e1, which is in Totonicapan, Guatemala. They describe their community as: \"Totonicap\u00e1n, land of apples, pines, and beautiful women.\" Totonicap\u00e1n is one of the leading producers of popular Guatemalan crafts, which are in high demand because of their variety and quality. \r\n\r\nLas Manzanas is in its sixth loan cycle. Some of its members have stayed with the group and others are relatively new. \r\n\r\nAn enthusiastic member of the group is Mrs. Santos. Her name is derived from the fact that she was born on Holy Thursday, a holy week in Guatemala. She is 62 years old and has nine children, three girls and six boys. Her business involves dying yarn. She purchases raw yarn, makes a variety of dyes. and produces finished yarn in different colors and in large quantities. She started her business 24 years ago when she learned it from her husband\u2019s family. She has now taught her children the technique. \r\n\r\nSantos will use the loan to buy raw materials in bulk because the price is favorable. She has a good demand for her products. One of her main customers wants to have orders delivered every 15 to 20 days. This request is for a customer 3\u00bd hours away from Santos's home. The demand makes Santos very happy because there are currently three people working for her business but if she has higher demand it might be a possible to employ more people. \r\n\r\nSantos is very thankful to all Kiva lenders for providing her with the opportunity to improve her business.  The loans are not only helping the women because the profit that they make will also benefit their children.  \r\n\r\nLas Manzanas is grateful to Kiva investors for the loans they are giving. Thanks to these microloans they can move forward. They are aware that the economic situation in the country and around the world is difficult and are thankful that people trust them and are allowing them to boost rural development.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5925,"image":{"id":1369002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

During the previous loan cycle, the women successfully made their monthly payments on time. In addition, they participated during their monthly training sessions and learned about women\u2019s health, children\u2019s rights and business administration. The trainings were taught by the staff of Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we reported about Gladys, one of the hardworking women who supports herself, her two daughters and her sick father. Gladys had a convenience store and connected well with her customers with her great personality and cheerful demeanor. With her previous loan, Gladys was also able to purchase pigs to fatten up and sell. Recently, she got a one-year job as a cleaning lady from an organization in her community. Because of this, she closed her store but continues to sell food and snacks called \u201crefacciones\u201d in the front yard of her home to local residents every weekend. At the current time, Gladys has requested an additional loan, which she will use to purchase additional ingredients to make snacks. She also plans to buy a bull to fatten up and sell.\r\n\r\nGladys is the secretary of the Board of Directors of the Trust Bank. She is hopeful that Kiva investors will decide to show their confidence in the group by providing the funds for a new loan cycle. She knows that the women in her group will act responsibly by making their monthly payments on time as they did in the previous loan cycle. She states, \"On behalf of the group, I thank the many people around the world who have placed their trust in each of us. We appreciate the trust that they have in us and their thoughtfulness in saving some money to invest in our businesses. We know that we face a better and more prosperous future because of this.

These hardworking women are engaged in various businesses including the manufacture and sale of traditional clothing, or the sale of embroidery thread used for the beautiful and traditional textiles of the region. Others are the owners of storefronts or involved with animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nAna is one of the new members of the Trust Bank. She is the 35-year-old mother of five children. She proudly tells us that four of them are in school. Since Ana became widowed two years ago, she has the sole responsibility of providing the basic needs to her children who range in age from 7 to 17.\r\n\r\nAna raises animals and currently has two dozen chickens and three pigs. She is able to generate an income for her family but wishes to grow her business. She is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to buy more chickens and four more pigs. With the loan, she will be able to purchase feed for fattening up the animals, which she will sell in the nearest market, 20 minutes from her community.\r\n\r\nAna says that this loan means a lot to her since it is the first time she has been able to secure a loan. She has learned a lot about effective business practices including how to budget and manage working capital so that she can make a profit and grow her business. She appreciates the encouragement and support of the other women in her Trust Bank.\r\n\r\nIn her own words, \u201cI dream of a better future and I understand that it will not come along by itself. We need to work hard to make our dreams come true. I dreamed of having a business but I did not have enough capital. Now that I have a loan, I can work hard, earn an income, keep my children in school and have a better future.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":1373431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

The loan will be used to buy more fresh food such as raw bananas for selling, and will help Jesca to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young siblings. Jesca hopes that in the future, she will be able to improve on her family's standards of living. \r\n\r\nJesca is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The loan will be used to buy more drinks such as sodas and snacks to resell as well as will help Martha to generate greater profits and have a better life. Martha hopes that, in the future, she will be able to expand into a retail shop. \r\n\r\nMartha is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale as well as will help Angella to generate greater profits and improve her family standards of living. Angella hopes that, in the future, she will be able to build rental houses. \r\n\r\nAngella is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is single and has one child who is currently in school. For the past one year, Hafisa has been working hard to manage her clothes store, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hafisa has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more clothes for selling, and will help Hafisa to generate greater profits and improve her family's standards of living. Hafisa hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand her clothes business into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nHafisa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past 3 years, Betty has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soft drinks, sodas and snacks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Betty has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more drinks, such as soda, and snacks to sell. This will help Betty to generate greater profits and take care of herself. Betty hopes that in the future she will be able to become a powerful business woman in town. \r\n\r\nBetty is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Jane has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soft drinks, sodas and snacks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jane has asked for a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy snacks and more drinks such as sodas to sell in her shop. This will help Jane to make bigger profits, and buy another fridge for the business. Jane hopes that in the future she will be able to educate her children up to university. \r\n\r\nJane is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1373222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

They live close to each other and have strong friendship bonds. Their difficult living conditions made them join hands and form the group in order to acquire a group loan from Al Majmoua. Maha is the leader and featured member of this group. She is a 40-year-old married mother of two children, standing in the center of the picture. Her husband owns a small business where he makes and sells pastry, and she works there in order to help him with the baking and to maximize the profit. However, because they live in a small village, their revenue is limited to the number of customers. They earn barely enough to provide for their children, especially since they are both enrolled in private schools, which means that the schooling fees are somewhat of a burden. She decided to acquire a loan in order to purchase ingredients and machines that would facilitate the baking process.\r\n\r\nInes is a 30-year-old married mother of two children, standing on the left in the picture. She owns a hairdressing salon in the village. Her husband owns a pick-up and earns his living my fulfilling requests.

Faridah is 22 years old and lives in the town of Seeta in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has two children, one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Faridah has been working hard to manage her small market business selling raw bananas. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Faridah has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more raw food such as matooke, Irish potatoes and sweet potatoes, and will help Faridah to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Faridah hopes that in the future, she will be able to become a powerful businesswoman in town. \r\n\r\nFaridah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1374241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is single and has one child. For the past two years, Irene has been working hard to manage her brick business, which does brick laying. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Irene has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy firewood and also to pay her workers, and will help Irene to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Irene hopes that in the future she will be able to become a powerful businesswoman in town. \r\n\r\nIrene is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

He saw a market for solar lights that can help people living in areas with limited access to electricity, and for water filters for people who usually drink straight from rain water because clean water is very hard to get, and for clean, fuel-efficient cookstoves for households who still use three-stone stoves which produce a lot of harmful smoke.\n\nHe will use the loan to purchase these technologies and set up a technology kiosk, the first on Nusa Penida selling life-changing, eco-friendly technologies.

Raphael is a farmer, which is why he owns a two-hectare plot of land where he grows cacao and fruit trees, which he tries to always keep in good condition.

This time he wants to have 1,000 nuevos soles to hire local workers to harvest the fruit of his cacao trees."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1372090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire local workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-19T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-19T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raphael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":95.03},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":103.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":103.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":110.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.57,"local_amount":81.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":83.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997146},{"amount":31.37,"local_amount":83.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":85.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864616},{"amount":35.31,"local_amount":94.14,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":96.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352983},{"amount":36.46,"local_amount":97.24,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":99.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904749},{"amount":35.64,"local_amount":95.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":97.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090754},{"amount":38.83,"local_amount":103.56,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":106.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777402},{"amount":38.72,"local_amount":103.24,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":105.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450597956},{"amount":41.39,"local_amount":110.37,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-15T12:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":113.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147286},{"amount":42.75,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-09T09:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":116.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240518},{"amount":43.96,"local_amount":117.24,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-01T11:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":120.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258090}],"funded_date":"2013-06-20T21:23:29Z","paid_date":"2015-01-01T11:11:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":574618,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is married and has two children.

It has 8 members led by a governing board presided over by Delia.  The communal bank members are in a variety of businesses among which are: skirt sewing, fruit sales, book binding and food sales.\r\n\r\nThe loan they\u2019ll take out will benefit small micro businesswomen like Delia.  She indicates that she\u2019s been in Pro Mujer for a year and a half having joined thanks to an invitation from one of the institution\u2019s advisers that came to visit her at home.  She currently has a business selling fruit, a business she started on her mother\u2019s initiative since she helped her sell said product.  Later on she decided to start her own business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019ll take out is to increase capital.  She will buy fruit from wholesalers in the city of El Alto and then resell it in her sales space.  This way of working allows her to generate income to support her home since she\u2019s single and has two children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the credit and sharing with her fellow members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5425,"image":{"id":1375162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Tatyana needs a loan in the amount of 22,000 hryvnia to purchase bags, jars, lids and other household goods for canning berries, fruits and vegetables.

He previously worked as a miner.  Sergei is involved in growing berries and vegetables in a garden in the summer.

He is in agriculture for a living because as a child he grew up in the countryside together with his parents who relied on him for small tasks cultivating cocoa and coffee to obtain income and maintain themselves economically. When he grew up, he began to work a lot because he had a family and needed to get ahead in life. His parents decided to help him, gifting him a small plot of land with fields of cocoa that helped him start independently. Today he says he has a hectare of crops where he also has fruit trees. To improve the quality of his products he usually uses organic fertilizer because he thinks using artificial fertilizers deteriorates the quality of his soil.

He works buying and selling frozen fish, an activity that he has been doing for 6 years along with 2 associates who help him select, transport, and sell the fish.  With this business, he is able to support his family, giving them a tranquil life where their needs are provided for.  His constant desire to achieve led him to start up this business, and over time it is becoming well known, because he sells the freshest and tastiest fish in the market.  At first it was very complicated for him to adapt to this routine, because he didn't know the business well.  But over time, he has grown the business.  What he likes most about his work is talking to his customers.  What he considers most difficult is putting up with the intense smell that emanates from the fish, because this impregnates his clothing and his body.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of this, he hopes in the future to have a vehicle that he can set up to transport his products and keep them fresh for much longer.  This will be his 6th loan with Kiva, and he is grateful for this opportunity and for the trust being provided to him so that he can get ahead.  For this reason, he promises to make his payments on time.  With the sum of 2,500 Peruvian soles that he requests, he will buy a variety of different fish of the best sizes, so that he can continue to sell them.

She is pictured on the extreme left with her hand raised. All the members of the group live in a village which is in Manipur, one of the northeastern states of India.\r\n\r\nVanlalngak and her husband work side by side to manage the family expenses. Her husband is a contractual driver for big wheels, and his income entirely depends on the number of days he works\/drives. Therefore, his income is unreliable and meager. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the financial condition, Vanlalngak started raising pigs. At the initial stages of her piggery business, she built a sty with the help of her husband at the back of their house, and purchased two piglets. She said she already tried her hand in various income-generating businesses like selling charcoal, selling vegetables, and weaving. But she failed because she cannot combine her outdoor business with the household chores.\r\n\r\nVanlalngak chose to raise pigs, and she is doing great with her piggery farm. She raised pigs in a very economical way by collecting leftover foods from neighbours and also from the neighbouring villages. She also searches for edible grass in the nearby fields and farms for pig feed. The foods are then cooked with powdered rice grain. The rice grain is bought from the rice mill at a cheaper rate. Once the pigs are fully grown and ready to be sold, she usually sells them in the village and neighbouring villages. She also bought a used two-wheeler Scooty (scooter) from the income that she generated from selling pigs. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she is planning to purchase chicks and start raising poultry besides raising pigs. She said her huge backyard should be utilized, and it should be of good use for raising poultry, too. Her interest in raising chicks started because pigs can be sold only once in a year, and if she can raise chickens, she can sell them after a time period of three months. She speculates she can sell poultry four times in a year, and is hopeful to be successful with her poultry.\r\n\r\nShe thanked WSDS strongly and says her husband\u2019s love and respect grows more with the ability to share family financial issues. \u201cThe bond is stronger and the family\u2019s burden is lighter with both of us sharing.\u201d She thanked Kiva and WSDS once again for all the support and assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1370839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase chicks, raise them, and sell them for profit when fully grown.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-06-20T00:40:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-20T00:40:19Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nengtinlam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikhohat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimthenhat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoilenmawi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanlalngak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkhol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neklomkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-20T16:29:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":572625,"name":"Farolitos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento FAROLITOS est\u00e1  compuesto por ocho  integrantes todas mujeres,  la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main source of the family is Shalva\u2019s monthly salary. He works at the Georgian bread bakery. Their additional income is Shalva\u2019s grandfather\u2019s monthly pension. The total amount is 500 GEL and it\u2019s rarely enough to cover food expenses. \r\n\r\nShalva requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Shalva has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Shalva will start trading with vegetables. He will buy at the wholesale price to resell with a price mark-up among the villagers and at the local markets. Shalva is very hard working man.
