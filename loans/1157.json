Wesley owns the following: 'cow, poultry, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, electricity, TV, DVD' but does not have 'solar power, running water, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1371970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-20T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-20T06:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wesley","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3594.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3689.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3787.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3887.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3990.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4095.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4204.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4315.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4429.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4546.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4666.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4789.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.14},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":179.52,"local_amount":14960.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":15340.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980860},{"amount":48.55,"local_amount":4045.84,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4148.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449657909},{"amount":48.86,"local_amount":4071.49,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4174.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467943850},{"amount":51.18,"local_amount":4264.62,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4372.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479164824},{"amount":40.57,"local_amount":3381.11,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3466.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859469},{"amount":53.89,"local_amount":4490.45,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4604.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287010},{"amount":177.43,"local_amount":14754.66,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":15129.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517571035}],"funded_date":"2013-06-29T11:44:57Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T13:24:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Natalie Eslick","image":1085366}},{"id":572582,"name":"Manushak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manushak is 40 years old.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit Manushak will begin selling bed linen.

and individual response in their aftermath. More than that, he has studied how to respond, taken several government-sponsored natural disaster response classes, and became certified to teach emergency preparedness. \r\n\r\nHe is so passionate about educating others about how to be prepared for natural disasters and other emergencies that he decided to he would establish his own company, called Continuity Man. He offers emergency preparedness training to schools and businesses, and offers free advice through his radio show on 550 KTSA Radio, which broadcasts throughout South Texas.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a huge disconnect between government programs out there and the average citizen,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHomeland Security through FEMA, they have a wide-reaching public awareness campaign, but still the connection between emergency responders, police, fire,  EMS and FEMA in the more serious disasters, what first responders do and what they are able to produce and what the average citizen understands is their responsibility.\u201d\r\n \r\nRiley said most people don\u2019t understand that the scope of assistance that the federal government can offer is limited.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were many lessons from Hurricane Katrina that weren\u2019t learned that should have been common knowledge,\u201d Riley said.  \u201cAnd while Homeland Security through FEMA has a wide-reaching public awareness campaign, there is still a disconnect in people\u2019s understanding.

City of San Antonio's small business liaison.\r\n\r\nRiley is using his $5,450 loan to fund advertising, to hire professionals to help him produce a high quality radio program, and to pay for air time. \r\n\r\nHe said he is having success in acquiring clients and in building his show. \r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been going really well,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWithout Accion Texas, I would not have

Upon exiting the military in 2010, they felt a deep responsibility to contribute to social change and provide a way of saying \u201cThank you\u201d to veterans.  Thus the idea of repurposing real bullets into bottle openers was created, with a goal to raise funds for veteran-focused groups.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Bullets2Bandages is to provide simple ways for every American to show their support and gratitude for veterans.  They donate 15% of all their profits to veteran-focused groups, including the The Travis Manion Foundation.  Cole and Erik believe strongly in the power of social responsibility and social innovation.  Together they strive to create a company that is responsible in its business practices and always has a cause.  Within their company they try to hire veterans, helping them transition into the civilian workforce.  \r\n\r\nTwo years after starting out, their business has grown into a dedicated warehouse and employs seven full-time employees.  However, what is most remarkable about their business is the strong community they\u2019ve built on social media.  Their Facebook page has over 130,000 followers who are all passionate about supporting veterans!\r\n\r\nCole and Erik\u2019s $10,000 Kiva loan will be used to streamline their business processes and fund new product development.  With your help, Cole and Evan can continue to give back to veterans and their families in need of support.\r\n\r\nA message from Cole and Erik: \u201cThank you to everyone in the Kiva community.  The support that each of you gives inspires entrepreneurs to succeed across the world and changes people\u2019s lives.  In the future, we plan to come back to Kiva and invest in other business ventures and to continue to be a part of the Kiva community.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more information on Bullets2Bandages, visit their

She started business for the daily survival of her family.\r\n \r\nMbalu runs a food-stand business. She sells chicken and fish within a busy market area. She has been running this business since 2006. She works at the business nine hours per day, seven days per week.   Mbalu says that the main challenges to her business are transportation problems and price fluctuations.\r\n\r\nMbalu has requested a loan in order to buy food commodities for resale, like cooking oil and packaged chicken. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mbalu plans to have a permanent business residence.

This is her story.\nI am Rose from Malindi, Kenya, a town along the Indian Ocean. I come from a needy family of four headed by a father who is a waiter in a tourist Hotel. I live in a society where education is highly degraded and traditions given first priority. This is characterized by early marriages of girls at premature ages, high rate of HIV\/AIDS and drug and substance abuse. This is very disheartening as the society continues to lag behind as many young people succumb to the vices. Coming from such a society gives me the strong will to make it in life and give back to my society. However, this will be only a dream because of the financial status of my family, thus I result in turning to KIVA for a loan that will enable me to successfully acquire university education at Strathmore University. Upon the completion of my education I intend to give back to my society by starting an organisation that will strive to highlight the need to eradicate early marriages. Secondly I intend through the organization to educate the society on the negatives of drug and substance abuse, thus creating a difference in the society. I trust that the KIVA loan will make my dream a reality. It is my commitment that I will comply with the terms and conditions governing the Kiva loan for the betterment of the organisation at large."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":11650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":292.39,"image":{"id":1368778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is his story.\nMy name is Josphat. I am from a family of four children; I am the eldest. My parents have no stable income and rely on our small piece of land to cater for our needs education included. The  sales from our single dairy cow and the farm products is not enough and have led to my parents struggle much to raise us. The situation was made worse by them spending a lot on my treatment. They are also paying for my brother who is in secondary and the other will be joining secondary next year.\n I was born with leg problems and was forced to stay at a disabled children\u2019s home undergoing treatment for 2 years when I was young. Despite the challenges I have worked hard and devoted to give my all to ensure their efforts are paid. I have also been involved in community based groups where we have been helping the needy in the society such as the elderly. I really need financial assistance so that I can see my dream come true and also be able to help others in the society. I look forward for your assistance and thanks in advance.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":11650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":11650,"image":{"id":1374845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story.\nMy name is Naomi; I have one brother and one sister who are in Primary and Secondary schools respectively. I would like to study the course of Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management at Strathmore University. I am doing so, so as to achieve my long life dream of becoming a CEO in an International Hotel and thereby assisting my parents in catering for my siblings' future expenses.  My father is currently not in a formal employment but is engaged in part time jobs while my mother is in a small scale business locally; selling 2nd hand clothes. I plan to commit myself in community service in the Campus Kiva, by joining the Red Cross projects as I am certified in the area. I will also participate in other community work projects for the needy, such as the 'Marter Hospital Heart run'. In future I plan to also lend money to other deserving students, through Kiva to ensure continuity and a bright future for

This is her story.\nMy name is Brenda Mwendwa. I would like to undertake a Bachelor of Business Science in Financial Economics in Strathmore University. I have one elder sibling, a sister.  I applied for the course at Strathmore University because of its good quality of educational services and facilities.  Upon graduation, I would like to become a financial analyst in a bank. This will enable me to give investment suggestions to clients and evaluate the economic outlook on different sectors and industries.\nThe reason why I applied for Kiva loan is because my parents could not be able to afford the fees for the whole course. My sister also depends on my parents for financial support though she is self-employed. The Kiva loan will also ensure that I study well without any financial setbacks. In studying the course at the university, I am planning to join the Campus Kiva Club that will help me build my professional skills and participate in community service projects. I also plan to become a lender in the Kiva Organisation once I get a stable job so that I can help other needy students to acquire financial support and achieve their dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":15525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4972.16,"image":{"id":1367949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story.\nMy name is Totona and I come from Narok county,  from a polygamous family. My father has nine wives. Currently living with my mother and  three brothers. Given this opportunity, I will be the first to join University while the other two are in primary school and another in secondary school. I chose to study at Strathmore University because of its quality education and high moral conduct among students. I want to study Bachelor of Science in telecommunications and work for a senior manager for one of the telecommunications companies after my graduation. I hope that one day I will be a role model for the community that I come from. In Narok, most young men and boys spend days and nights moving herds of cows from area to another looking for pasture. In future, I will also lend on KIVA site.

This is his story.\nMy name is Jackson. I hail from a humble background. I was born alone before the passing of my mother while I was 10 years of age. As a result, I was left under care of my aunt. She had a son and 2 daughters. With so much financial problems and assistance from USAID APHIA PLUS and well wishers we managed to complete secondary education for me and my male cousin. I was the only one who managed to get an admission in public university after passing my National Exam.\nI have applied for KIVA loan for assistance since I found it difficult in paying tuition fees and would like to pursue my degree in Bachelor of Commerce. Upon completion of my education, I intend to give back to the society by starting an organization that will help other needy, orphans and potential individuals through their education to make their dream true.\nI believe that KIVA  will make my dream a reality by enabling me to pursue my career course at Strathmore University where I will obtain quality education from skilled lecturers. It also has an enabling environment for learning with high standards of discipline.\nI promise to comply with terms and conditions governing the KIVA loan for the betterment of the organization at large.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":11650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1371731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is his story.\nMy name is George; a first born in a family of three. My mother passed away in 2004.\nI have always wanted to study information technology and become an expert in that area - but I do not have the means to afford university education to pursue a degree course. My father, who is a painter, depends on casual labour to take care of the family and with his meager earnings which is hand to mouth and there is nothing to save for my university education.\nI am glad to have been selected for KIVA loan, which will finance my studies at Strathmore University so that I can realize my dreams of becoming an Information Technology specialist.  There was no other way that I could have pursued my University education were it not for KIVA loan. I feel like I have stepped into my dream. While at Strathmore I will take part in Campus KIVA activities and bring positive change to the lives of other. In Future I also intend to give to KIVA by being a lender on KIVA website.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":14625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1373041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Both of my siblings are in schools, one in high school four and the other in primary. My parents work as peasant farmers in the dry lands of Kitui County. In my district there are only a few who have managed to study up to the University Level, mainly due to lack of financial capabilities. I completed secondary education in 2012 emerging as the second best in the K.C.S.E Exams in my school. I want to study Bachelor of Commerce (BCOM) as I dream of becoming an accountant. In future, am willing to help other needy people in the society without favor irrespective of the community they emerge from. In future, I am ready to hold hands with the Strathmore Fraternity through the KIVA Loan Scheme, to help more students benefit from this noble

This is her story.\nI am Stella from in Bungoma County. I come from a family of three and I am the second born. My father works with Water Resources Management Authority while my mother teaches at Teachers Training College. Payment of school fees has been challenging for us with my parents struggling to make ends meet despite my father's sick condition which has proven costly too. I aspire to be a professional actuary and a key volunteer in community projects. I would like to engage in other projects like KIVA with an aim of reducing dependency ratio in the society. I would like to see my dreams become a reality and therefore I requested KIVA lenders to grant me financial aid through a loan to be able to study Actuarial Science at Strathmore University, engage in community service projects and acquire skills in profession building. This loan will enable me fulfill my dreams. I pledge to comply with KIVA terms and conditions and on completion of my studies pay back the loan and be able to aid my family and other needy people in the society.

Tufaniso wants to repair her house because it needs updating, but she does not have enough money for this.  After seeking advice from relatives, she decided to obtain a loan from Arvand.  Tufaniso plans to use this loan to buy construction materials for fixing up the rooms.  She hopes that she will be financially supported at Arvand and helped with realizing her plans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1370131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

name is Hellen,I come from Turkana County.I went to Turkana Girls\u2019 Secondary where I managed to get a grade of a B plain. I am the first born of the family of six and I live with my uncle who is a pastor in Lodwar.My  parents divorced when I was only 5years old and because my mother could not provide for me , I had to stay with  my uncle.\r\nWhile at secondary school I could not raise my school fees but because of my commitment to church activities, the church raised my school fees. On completing my secondary level, I had to use the Business skills I got from school to start a small business so that I can help my family. I would buy fish from the fishermen at the shores of lake Turkana, fry them and sell to raise money for my family.\r\nActually after getting my grade I thought my dream of becoming an accountant was shuttered because of lack of money to proceed with my education and also join Strathmore which was the school of my dream. I thank God that though a 2012 KIVA Full tuition beneficiary of KIVA , I got the information that I can follow my dream by getting the loan.\r\nI came to know about Strathmore University through newspapers and magazines. As result and I become so much interested  with  the  high quality of education it gives and I also believed that it is the only place I could achieve my dream of becoming an accountant and also it could be a place that I could acquire life skill and this all is only possible because of KIVA.\r\nI am sure that if I get the KIVA Loan my mind will settle and I will be working very hard at school so that I will get good grades that I can get a good job that will help me give back to my community, help my sibling and also eradicate poverty from Turkana

name is Rebecca from Turkana County, I am a second born in a family of six siblings. I have one sister and four brothers. I have been living with my uncle since I was 7 years, after my parents separated, because I had no one else to take care of me.\r\nI went through my secondary education in Turkana Girls\u2019 Secondary School and I managed to score a mean grade of B+. My school fees were met by Mama Mzungu Foundation, which only offers help to secondary school students only. I was introduced to a KIVA beneficiary from Turkana; she received her full tuition last year and is now an exemplary student at Strathmore. \r\nI chose Strathmore University because it is one of the leading universities in Kenya, offering quality education, and produces the best professionals in the country.  I am interested in pursuing a Bachelor of  Business Information Technology. \r\nGiven the loan to take me through my entire 4-year course, I promise to work very hard to get good grades and after graduating, get a good job, which will empower me to clear the KIVA loan. I also look forward to giving back to the society especially in my home area, Turkana, which is faced by many challenges because it is situated in the arid parts of Kenya.\r\n  \r\n

after both of my parents died when I was still at a tender age as well as my twin brother who also passed away earlier than expected making me to remain  a single child in the family to date.\r\n\r\nI hail from a society where education is highly degraded and traditions set in the forefront. This is as characterized by early marriages of girls at premature ages as well as boys due to increased intake of drug substances resulting to their education being held at stake.\r\n\r\nThis is very disheartening and sends a lot of concerns to me as the society continue to derail as young people succumb from the vices. Coming from such a society gives me power and strength that I will prove my critics wrong and give back to the society. I am turning to KIVA for a loan that will enable me  to successfully acquire university education at Strathmore university. Upon completion of my education I strongly believe in giving back to the society by providing moral authority and setting up institutions that will be able to curb such vices amicably and streamline the society.\r\n\r\nI trust that KIVA will make my ambitions come true and will comply with the terms and conditions governing the KIVA loan for the betterment of the institution at large."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":11650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1375842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

is a student at Strathmore. This is his story.\nMy name is Moses, a second born in a family of five. I am resident of Uasin Gishu County; where my parents live. My father and my mother practice small scale farming with one acre; planting farm and three cattle (one cow and 2 heifers).\nWhen I showed my academic capability my parents were assisted with well wishers and managed to get bursaries that enabled to finance my school fees. While at secondary school, I portrayed leadership skills where I was a church captain for 3 years and hockey assistant captain where we lead our team to play at provincial level thrice. I believe given an opportunity at Strathmore will manage to do better in such similar fields. It has always been my dream to be an Actuary and help to foster development in our society, by enabling companies and diverse institutions in our growing economy to realise their strengths and weaknesses and thus explore their opportunities and curb their risks. I have wished to pursue my degree in Actuarial Science at Strathmore University but my family financial status does not allow me hence leaving me with KIVA as my only option. I am so pleased about KIVA and I thank the founders. After my studies I will a lender via

He leaves from his house very early every day and collects a considerable amount of material and then he takes it to the city Acaparadores. \r\n  \r\nThe loan requested will be invested in the construction of metal doors for his house. Currently, the doors are made of wood and when he leaves with his wife the house is vulnerable to being broken into and robbed of the few goods they have. To date, he has built a roof and he also has a plastic carpet and today in the rainy season everything is wet and he fears that the wooden doors will deteriorate.     \r\n\r\nHis life will improve with the repairs made to the house with more secure windows and doors and his pick up won't be exposed to the elements during the rainy season. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he plans to add onto his home and to install electricity since he currently lights his home with a gas light.

At first she sewed women's clothing, but switched to selling groceries because of the higher demand for food than for clothing. She sells canned goods, pasta, sugar, bread, and laundry detergents. She wants to expand her business and has asked for a loan of 3000 somoni to buy more grocery products and increase her working capital. She awaits your kindness.

Eight years ago, she decided to start her own business selling beauty products and medicinal products in order to help pay her family's household expenses. She started out by working with some beauty suppliers and attending their meetings. In time, Mary began to diversify her merchandise and offer a bigger variety of products, responding to the orders her customers put in. Mary allows her customers to purchase items with cash or on credit. She sells principally to her neighbors and friends. Also, each day she gets referred to new customers for the relaxing massage services she offers. Mary owns her own massage bed to complement her beauty product sales.\r\n\r\nMary has already received two loans through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which have helped her to gradually strengthen her business. She has increased her working capital as well as her earnings. This has helped her to support her children and pay for them to receive a higher education. Mary's personal goals include seeing her children graduate from college. Her business goals include one day opening a well-equipped store and further improving her sales. Challenges she faces in reaching this goal are gaining greater competency with her beauty products and marketing her massage services. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Mary is applying for a Kiva loan in order to buy perfume, capillary creams, disposable towels, and other supplies she needs in order to improve the services she offers and increase her earnings. This will make her loan a successful investment.

This increased his profits and the loan was also enough for him to buy a cooler in order to increase his sales of drinks and soft drinks. Since he received his Kiva loan he has been supporting his family, since he has involved them in his two activities and they are generating incomes by helping him out. He is very happy about this. Manuel tells his Kiva lenders the following: 'Thank you so much for this loan and for the opportunity to make my business grow'.\r\n\r\nHe is now applying for a new Kiva loan, which he will use to buy sacks made out of synthetic thread and of fique, both of which are in high demand at his market, and he will also invest in soft drinks, an activity that generates incomes and complements the profits made from selling sacks. He is efficiently investing his Kiva loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1373442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Matlub is a cheerful man, age 52.  He is married and has three children.  He lives with his family in rural area.  Two of his sons are grown and help him with his work. To have a stable income, Matlub works with livestock.  His wife helps him and takes care of the cows while they are being fattened.  She also sells the dairy products provided by the cows' milk.  Matlub not only works with animals, he is also the head of a cooperative farm in his village.  He receives good profits from his business.  Now, the family's expenses are increasing since his sons have their own wives and children that need to be provided for.  Together with his sons, Matlub wants to expand his business to increase their income enough to provide for the large family.  He has turned to Arvand to take a loan to buy a few head of cattle.  He hopes for a positive outcome and is grateful for Arvand's support.

Esta pareja de esposos que ya no tiene hijos a su cargo viven en Latacunga un lugar que cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos para turistas nacionales y extranjeros principalmente por el Centro Hist\u00f3rico de la ciudad que ha sido considerado Patrimonio Cultural del Ecuador desde hace casi 30 a\u00f1os. Capital de una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador; Cotopaxi y que los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera.

","en":"Judith is a 51-year-old woman. Due to a lack of economic resources, her parents were only able to support her through primary school. Since she was little she has contributed to the household chores, and she was very young when she married. Her husband Nelson, 53, works as a professional chauffeur. The couple do not have any children living at home. They live in Latacunga, a place which has a number of attractions for national and international tourists, including the city's historical centre, which has been considered part of Ecuador's cultural heritage for nearly 30 years and is capital of one of the provinces of Ecuador's Sierra region, and the Cotopaxi volcano. In recent years, the city has developed considerably and is now considered one of the most important in the region, thanks to the flower, mineral, metal, agriculture and farming industries. There are also several businesses generating significant revenue, helping to convert the city into a commercial centre with opportunities for people to get ahead. Despite a poverty rate of over 50%, people have looked for a way to move forward and to make their ideas a reality.\r\n\r\nFor 20 years, Judith has run a convenience store which is open from very early in the morning to the evening, for 10 hours or more every day. When she has free time in her shop, she makes extra money by sewing. Judith wants to stock up her shop with new products which will generate a better income and attract more customers. Her biggest difficulty has been bureaucracy; financial institutions have put various obstacles in the way of her getting the loan she wants to use to expand her business to sell first aid products and sweets. Therefore, Judith has asked for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, with whom she found the reliability, flexibility and openness she had been looking for. She is thankful to Kiva for enabling people around the world to be part of her dream. Judith hopes that she will be able to use the additional income to support her children, who at times struggle economically, and she would also like to reinvest in her business by buying new merchandise.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1373463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock up her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-20T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-20T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1635.76,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":124.44},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":127.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":130.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":132.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":136.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":138.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":141.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":145.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":147.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":151.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":154.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Brown","image":560642}},{"id":572850,"name":"Mahmoud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mhamoud is 25 years old from Gaza.

recibi\u00f3 el apoyo para culminar la escuela primaria, luego le impartieron el emp\u00edrico conocimiento del trabajo con todo lo relacionado con la agricultura. Actualmente est\u00e1 casado con Mar\u00eda quien tiene 43 a\u00f1os y trabaja como ama de casa y tambi\u00e9n ayudando a Julio en las labores del campo. Viven solos en el Cant\u00f3n de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. Los productos agr\u00edcolas m\u00e1s comercializados son granos como arveja, fr\u00e9jol, lenteja, haba y tambi\u00e9n varias frutas y verduras. La producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados abastece la distribuci\u00f3n interna y el excedente se env\u00eda a la Regi\u00f3n Costa en productos ya procesados. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nJulio aprendi\u00f3 las labores del campo desde que era un ni\u00f1o y luego las convirti\u00f3 en su trabajo habitual para poder llevar siempre el sustento a casa. Ya lleva 30 a\u00f1os en la labor de sembrar, cosechar y comercializar papas y chochos, adem\u00e1s de criar ganado para la producci\u00f3n de leche o para la posterior venta de los animales. Su esposa es de gran ayuda en esta actividad, pues las ocasiones que Julio sale a vender, ella alimenta a los animales o prepara la tierra en donde est\u00e1n los cultivos. Julio invierte al menos 6 horas a su negocio y cada vez tiene la expectativa de verlo crecer, sin embargo la dificultad de obtener cr\u00e9ditos para capitalizar el negocio, ha sido muy grande y no ha podido acceder a los cr\u00e9ditos de financieras comunes. Gracias al apoyo, credibilidad, agilidad y confianza que le brindaron en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, Julio ha decidido solicitar un cr\u00e9dito el cual lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de ganado para la producci\u00f3n de leche y adem\u00e1s la posterior venta de los animales. Julio est\u00e1 entusiasmado porque al fin tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de ver crecer a su negocio y con esto generar mayor utilidades que le permitan brindar un mejor estilo de vida a su esposa y a \u00e9l y adem\u00e1s les permita tener un ahorro para solventar gastos futuros de salud y falta de trabajo que puedan presentarse con la edad avanzada. Julio agradece a todos quienes a trav\u00e9s de la gesti\u00f3n de Kiva puedan ser parte de este crecimiento en su vida y les motiva a seguir apoyando los emprendimientos y microempresas de las personas que como \u00e9l sue\u00f1an con tener calidad de vida en sus hogares.","en":"Julio is a man of 56. He grew up in a country household where he received the support to complete his primary school. Later, they imparted to him the practical knowledge of work in everything related to agriculture. Currently he is married to Maria, who is 43 and works as a housewife and also helps Julio with the farmwork. They live alone in Salcedo canton, located in the eastern part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces in the Ecuadorian highlands. \r\n\r\nIn Salcedo there are various tourist attractions such as lakes and beach resorts which offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists. However the main activity that is carried on in this town is agriculture, and it to a lesser extent cattle raising. The most important agricultural products are staples such as  peas, beans, lentils, lima beans and also various fruits and vegetables. The production of milk and its byproducts supplies internal distribution and the excess is sent to the coastal region as processed products. Cattle raising is also well-suited to this area because of the pleasant climate which is enjoyed in the canton. \r\n\r\nIn spite of these productive activities, there are very worrisome indices of illiteracy and poverty, due unsatisfied basic needs such as sewage systems, which only 25% of the households have. \r\n\r\nJulio learned farmwork from the time he was a child and later made it his everyday work so as to always be able to support his household. He has been 30 years sowing, harvesting and selling potatoes and chochos (a food legume)  besides raising cattle for milk production. His wife is a great help in this activity as on the occasions when Julio goes out to sell, she feeds the animals or prepares the land where the crops are. \r\n\r\nJulio spends at least six hours in his business and each time has the hope of seeing it grow. However the difficulty of obtaining credit for capitalizing the business has been very great and he has not been able to access loans from regular banks. \r\n\r\nThanks to the support, credibility, expeditious service and trust they offer at Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, Julio has decided to request a loan which he will invest in the purchase of cattle for producing milk and for subsequent sale. Julio is enthusiastic because he will have the opportunity to see his business grow and with this generate greater profits which will allow him to offer him and his wife a better standard of living. In addition, it will allow them to have savings for meeting future health expenses and lack of work, both of which needs can arise with advanced age. \r\n\r\nJulio is grateful to those who through Kiva can be part of this growth in his life, and encourages them to continue supporting the business ventures of people, who like him, dream of having a better quality of life in their households."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1373412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Tres ni\u00f1os a\u00fan se encuentran estudiando. Do\u00f1a Andrea se dedica a la engorda y venta de borregos desde hace 10 a\u00f1os. Esta vez esta solicitando el credito para comprar mas borregos y pastura, los compra medianos solo para engordarlos por un tiempo para despu\u00e9s venderlos, comenta como inicio su actividad. Desde peque\u00f1a, Andrea que perdi\u00f3 a su madre, ayudaba a cuidar los borregos de su padre porque mientras \u00e9l trabaja tambi\u00e9n se dedicaba a la cr\u00eda de borregos para su venta y as\u00ed obtener un ingreso mas para solventar los gastos de sus hermanos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os. \"Cuando me case  yo tambi\u00e9n quer\u00eda ayudar a mi esposo con los gastos de mis hijos y gracias al cr\u00e9dito he podido hacer crecer el numero de mis borregos. La cria de los borregos es muy buena porque muchas veces cuando no tenemos dinero podemos vender nuestros borreguitos y as\u00ed salir del apuro econ\u00f3mico\". Durante los diez a\u00f1os la \u00fanica dificultad de Do\u00f1a Andrea es cuando sus animalitos enferman y llegan a morir para Do\u00f1a Andrea son perdidas de ganancias e inversi\u00f3n, aunque trata de cuidarlos mucho cada dos o tres meses su veterinario los revisa, Do\u00f1a Andrea trabaja mucho en la cr\u00eda de sus borregos para darle educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos su sue\u00f1o es que uno de sus hijos tenga alguna carrera profesional. Las integrantes del grupo al igual que Do\u00f1a Andrea est\u00e1n muy contentas y agradecidas con KIVA y Vision Fund porque podr\u00e1n invertir en sus negocios como Do\u00f1a Leonarda, Aurelia, Maxima invertir\u00e1 en Borregos, Martha invertir\u00e1 en Pastura para sus animalitos, Ofelia invertir\u00e1 pastura para sus becerros que tiene en casa.","en":"The \"Colonia Zapata\" group is from a very beautiful community known for its cornfields but above all for the unfailing kindness of its people. The group consists of six very hard-working women who place the welfare of their families above all else. One of the members, Do\u00f1a Andrea, noted, \"It was our choice because there is another group in the community with a very similar name.\"  She is 42 and married to Germ\u00e1n, a construction worker. They have four children who are all still dependents, three of whom are in school. For ten years, Do\u00f1a Andrea has raised sheep and sold them. She buys the sheep young for the sole purpose of fattening and selling them. She is requesting this loan to purchase more sheep and feed. Do\u00f1a Andrea began to help care for her father's sheep when she was a young girl and her mother died. She helped her father increase the family's income to meet the expenses of her raising her younger siblings. \"When I got married, I also wanted to help my husband with the cost of raising our children. A loan helped me raise more sheep. Raising sheep is very good because many times we can sell them when we don't have money, which gets us through tough times. The only problem Do\u00f1a Andrea has had in the past ten years has been when her sheep become sick and die. Sheep deaths represent losses of both income and investments to Do\u00f1a Andrea. She therefore tries to take excellent care of them and has a veterinarian examine them every two to three months. Do\u00f1a Andrea works long hours caring for her sheep so she can provide her children an education. Her dream is for one of the children to have a professional career. The other members of the \"Colonia Zapata\" group are very happy and grateful to KIVA and Vision Fund because they'll be able to invest in their businesses. Do\u00f1a Leonarda, Aurelia, and Maxima will purchase sheep, Martha will purchase feed for her animals, and Ofelia will buy feed for the calves she keeps at her home.

Members of this community have remained loyal to their customs and traditions, one of the most important being the Mazahua language. The group members decided on their name because they all make embroidered handicrafts. Do\u00f1a Alejandra, a new member of the group, is 51 and has for 28 years been married to Marcos. They have four children who are all independent. Do\u00f1a Alejandra has made handicrafts for forty years, having learned embroidery very young because her mother was also an embroiderer. Do\u00f1a Alejandra explained, \"Knowing how to embroider is a tradition. If someone here doesn't know how to embroider, it's as if that person didn't live in the community because this  skill is a part of our customs.\" Do\u00f1a Alejandra sells handicrafts from her home and has no difficulty making them. She is seeking this loan to purchase materials such as needles, yarn, wool thread, etc. \"The loan will help me greatly because it will allow me to purchase materials more easily.\" Do\u00f1a Alejandra's challenge is the lack of a market where she can sell her handicrafts. It's difficult to earn a good income in her community and surrounding towns. \"I'd like to find a way to help us identify a good market or some other way to offer our crafts,\" she explained. Do\u00f1a Alejandra and the other group members share the goal of improving their families' quality of life. They each strive diligently to earn a better income so they can meet their household expenses: children's education, clothing, shoes, and more food.

Esta familia esforzada vive en Latacunga capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador y que los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. \nMary se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de bloques de cemento desde hace 9 a\u00f1os aunque ya conoc\u00eda sobre esta actividad de toda su vida, pues en su familia tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a lo mismo. Ella junto a su esposo dedican al menos 9 horas cada d\u00eda a la preparaci\u00f3n de materiales, mezcla, forma y terminado de los bloques. En los \u00faltimos d\u00edas la demanda ha incrementado y la falta de material no le permite cumplir con todos sus clientes, mucho m\u00e1s cuando en \u00e9poca de lluvia los bloques tardan m\u00e1s tiempo con el proceso de secado. Es por esto que Mary ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que le permita comprar quintales de cemento y arena al por mayor para conseguir a mejor precio y as\u00ed incrementar la producci\u00f3n lo que por ende, le generar\u00e1 mayores utilidades para un d\u00eda poder hacer realidad su sue\u00f1o de comprar un cami\u00f3n para poder hacer entregas a domicilio. Mary agradece la apertura y confianza que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa ha tenido con ella, ya que muchas veces se le dificult\u00f3 la obtenci\u00f3n de un cr\u00e9dito en otras entidades financieras. Mary env\u00eda mucha gratitud a quienes alrededor del mundo y a trav\u00e9s de Kiva, est\u00e1n aportando para que la calidad de vida de su familia mejore. ","en":"Mary is a 28 year old young woman.  She went to school through primary school.  She got married when she was very young to Byron who is now 29 years old and the co-owner of the family business.  He also works in transportation, traveling outside the city to the coastal region of Ecuador.  They have two children, Kevin, who is 10 years old, and Britany, who is 2. Kevin studies at the public school in the city and Britany stays at home with her mother.  \r\n\r\nThe family lives in Latacunga, the capital of the Cotopaxi province, which is one of the provinces that forms part of the Sierra region of Ecuador.  In the last few years it has developed and is considered one of the most important in the region thanks to the flower, mineral, metallurgy, agro-industry, farming, and livestock industries.  In addition, there are businesses that generate interesting income that make it a commercial city with various opportunities to get ahead.\r\n\r\nMary has worked for nine years making cement blocks.  She has known this activity all her life since all of her family work doing the same thing.  Together with her husband, she works at least nine hours a day preparing the materials, mixing, forming, and finishing the blocks.  Recently, demand has increased and a lack of materials prevents her from serving all of her customers.  In addition, in the rainy season, the blocks take more time to dry.  This has led Mary to request a loan to purchase 46 kilogram sacks of cement and sand at wholesale so that she gets a better price.  This will allow her to increase production so that she will generate higher profits.  One day she hopes to realize her dream of purchasing a truck to be able to make deliveries to her customers' homes.  Mary appreciates the openness and trust that Fundacion Alternativa has in her since many times it has been difficult to obtain a loan from other financial entities.  Mary sends much gratitude to everyone around the world that is making her family's quality of life improve through Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1373507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials and tools to increase her production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-21T01:10:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-21T01:10:23Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Jeaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1060.54,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":172.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":176.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":180.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":183.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":187.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.29,"local_amount":160.11,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":162.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565409},{"amount":174.75,"local_amount":172.4,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":174.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814447},{"amount":178.51,"local_amount":176.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":178.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320620},{"amount":182.74,"local_amount":180.28,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":182.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856310},{"amount":376.71,"local_amount":371.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":376.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059885}],"funded_date":"2013-06-22T14:53:37Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":573455,"name":"Carlos Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos Luis es un joven dedicado a su familia y a su trabajo, labora vendiendo perfumes a domicilio desde hace seis meses, ya tiene su zona de clientes y quiere extenderse a otras comunidades ya que es necesario incremnetar sus ingresos, \u00e9l necesita un cr\u00e9dito por seiscientos sesenta mil colones (\u00a2660.000), con este dinero comprar\u00e1 perfumes y aguas refrescantes para ofrecer a su clientela.","en":"Carlos Luis is a young man who is dedicated to his family and to his work.

econ\u00f3micos, siempre le apoyaron, pero solo pudieron pagarle la escuela primaria, con cuyos conocimientos sali\u00f3 adelante y se defiende en su \u00e1rea. Est\u00e1 casado con Rosa de 30 a\u00f1os que trabaja realizando los quehaceres dom\u00e9sticos de su hogar, tienen 2 hijos de 13 y 11 a\u00f1os que se encuentran estudiando en un colegio p\u00fablico, y a quienes esperan darles la oportunidad de estudiar que ellos no tuvieron. Jaime con su familia viven en Latacunga capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador y que los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. Aunque hay un alto \u00edndice de pobreza el esp\u00edritu emprendedor de sus habitantes ha hecho que la  ciudad sobresalga. En el sector rural y urbano se puede encontrar familias destacando sus talentos para emprender con alguna idea que les pueda generar rentabilidad para conseguir el sustento diario. \nJaime desde hace 6 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con su carpinter\u00eda que juntamente con su esposa la atienden y a la que dedica entre 6 y 8 horas diarias, con el paso del tiempo ha logrado conseguir clientes que siempre le buscan por entregar un producto terminado de calidad, sin embargo cuando empez\u00f3 su negocio fue dif\u00edcil  que confiaran en \u00e9l por ser muy joven. Jaime sue\u00f1a con tener un d\u00eda su propia f\u00e1brica de muebles, es por esto que cada d\u00eda se esfuerza m\u00e1s para mejorar su trabajo y as\u00ed conseguir m\u00e1s clientes y tambi\u00e9n m\u00e1s experiencia pero uno de los obst\u00e1culos que ha atravesado es la dificultad para conseguir un cr\u00e9dito que le permita adquirir la madera necesaria y las herramientas para trabajar al por mayor, es por eso que ahora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo el cual lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de madera y materiales de carpinter\u00eda que le permitan producir m\u00e1s y mejores productos con mayor eficacia y as\u00ed lograr reconocimiento por su trabajo. Jaime agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por abrirle las puertas con confianza y adem\u00e1s capacitaci\u00f3n para poder dar este de crecimiento en su negocio y adem\u00e1s motiva a quienes a trav\u00e9s de Kiva est\u00e1n aportando para que sus sue\u00f1os se cumplan y as\u00ed \u00e9l pueda brindar a su familia un mejor estilo de vida.","en":"Jaime is 32 years old and grew up in a home with few financial resources.  They always supported him but he was only able to pay for primary school.  With that knowledge, he was able to get ahead and succeed in his field.  He is married to Rosa, who is 30 years old, and takes cares of their home.  They have two children who are 13 and 11 years old who are studying at the public high school.  They hope to give them the opportunity to study that they did not have.  \r\n\r\nJaime and his family live in Latacunga, the capital of the Cotopaxi province, which is one of the provinces that form part of the Sierra region in Ecuador.   In the last few years it has developed and is considered one of the most important in the region thanks to the flower, mineral, metallurgy, agro-industry, farming, and livestock industries. In addition, there are businesses that generate interesting income that make it a commercial city with various opportunities to get ahead.  Although there is a high level of poverty, the entrepreneurial spirit of the inhabitants have made it a city that stands out.  In the rural and urban areas, it is possible to find families using their talents to undertake an idea that can generate profits to support their daily expenses.  \r\n\r\nJaime has worked for six years as a carpenter.  Together with his wife, they attend the business and work between six and eight hours a day.  With the passage of time, he has succeeded in finding customers who always look for a well-finished product.  When he started his business, it was difficult to trust him since he was very young.  Jaime dreams of having his own furniture factory.  Every day he makes an effort to improve his work so that he can gain more customers and more experience.  One of the obstacles he has overcome is the difficulty in obtaining a loan that will allow him to acquire the necessary wood and working tools at wholesale.  This is why he has requested a loan to purchase wood and carpentry materials that will allow him to produce more and better products with more efficiency so that he can become well-known for his work.\r\n\r\nJaime is grateful to Fundacion Alternativa for opening their doors with trust and training so that he can grow his business.  He is encouraged by the people who are supporting him through Kiva so that he can achieve his dreams and provide his family with a better way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1373588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

Juntos viven actualmente en Latacunga, la capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador. En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os Latacunga se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. En esta ciudad muchas de las fiestas conservan un profundo arraigo y pureza muy cercanos a los or\u00edgenes hist\u00f3ricos o de la tradici\u00f3n ancestral.\nRosa al ver la necesidad econ\u00f3mica en su hogar, decidi\u00f3 desde hace un a\u00f1o, aportar con los gastos del hogar, dando el paso de emprender en un negocio de comercializaci\u00f3n de frutas y verduras, ubicado en un lugar estrat\u00e9gico de la ciudad en donde la mayor\u00eda de sus clientes son amas de casa. Rosa permanece en el local que es rentado atendiendo la demanda de sus clientes durante 10 horas cada d\u00eda, con la esperanza de que todos sus productos se vendan, pues al ser productos perecibles, se deterioran al poco tiempo y no es conveniente arriesgarse a perder sus clientes por no vender productos frescos, lo cual en el caso de ventas bajas significa una p\u00e9rdida. Desde el establecimiento de su negocio, Rosa ha intentado adquirir un pr\u00e9stamo en varias instituciones financieras, lo cual no ha sido posible por no cumplir con todos los requisitos que all\u00ed le piden y adem\u00e1s porque lleva poco tiempo con su negocio. Ahora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar frutas de temporada al por mayor como por ejemplo mandarina, naranja, lim\u00f3n, pera, mel\u00f3n, sand\u00eda  y uva.

She completed elementary school and has lived with her partner Luis since she was very young. They have lived together for many years and have three children who are 21, 20 and 12 years old, presently students, who they hope to see become excellent professionals. They currently live together in Latacunga, the capital of Cotopaxi province, one of the provinces that make up part of Ecuador's mountainous region. In recent years Latacunga has developed markedly in such a way that it is considered one of the most important towns of the region due to its industries, such as flower growing, mining, metallurgy, agroindustry, farming and livestock raising. In addition, there are business establishments that produce significant revenue which makes it a commercial city with many opportunities to get ahead. In this city many of the festivals maintain deep roots and a purity that is very close to the historical origins and the ancestral tradition.\r\n\r\nRosa could see the economic need in her household so one year ago she decided to contribute to the costs of the home, taking the step of beginning a business selling fruit and vegetables. It is located in a strategic part of the city where the majority of her clients are housewives. Rosa is present in the rented premises filling the requests of her customers for 10 hours a day, with the hope that all her products will sell, since being perishable products they will deteriorate in a short time. It is not a good idea to take the chance of losing her customers by not selling fresh products, so if her sales are low she sustains a loss. From the time her business was established, Rosa has been trying to obtain a loan from various financial institutions but this has not been possible because she cannot fill all their requirements and because her business has only been open for a short time.

It is comprised of eight members whose management board is led by Laura, the president.  The different businesses carried out by the group members include: a neighborhood store, transport, hardware store, sale of slippers, sale of popcorn, macram\u00e9 weaving, sale of vegetables and sale of baby clothing.\r\n\r\nThe loan will benefit the group of small business owners which Laura belongs to.  She says that she has been a member of Pro Mujer for four years and joined after being invited by a friend who is also a member of the institution.  She currently runs a business selling underwear, which she learned from her mother when they worked together.  Later she decided to branch out on her own.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to increase her stock (buying more clothing) which she will acquire wholesale at stores in the city of La Paz.  Afterwards, she will sell the goods at her stall.  This means of income allows her to generate enough resources to maintain her household where she is single and has a son.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says she enjoys the health area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3800,"image":{"id":1373550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He has five children and has lived in this community for about four years. He built his house on asphalt. It is the property of the government and they enjoy right of possession. Like many others, Don Herminio grew up in the country and learnt how to do many activities pertaining to agriculture and caring for livestock by working as a day labourer and from his own experience in growing subsistence crops. He later married and he and his family got ahead by working together. It was due to social security problems and health problems that he migrated from his birthplace. He later adapted to the ways of life of his new community. Breaking stones and traditional small-scale fishing in Laguna El Jocotal are the activities the majority of families do for a living. Now he makes a living by producing staple grains, especially corn, which he is going to grow in a plot of land he has leased on the outskirts of the community for the rainy season since there is no farming land where he lives as they practically live on a layer of solidified lava.\r\n\r\nHe buys the supplies for his crops from a supplier in the area since it is better to buy them in his own community because of his age and because of the additional costs incurred if he were to buy them elsewhere. He then carries them on his back with the help of his wife and one of his children for approximately 1.5 kilometres. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to fertilize 0.85 square kilometres of land ready to plant corn and he will also prepare the rest of the land for planting in the second season beginning on August 15. By doing this, he will not have to buy corn at expensive prices for his family to eat, which is good as he sometimes does not have enough money to buy what he needs due to the sporadic nature of his work as a day labourer.\r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to work with his own capital and repurchase some calved cows he had before. He had to sell them when he had kidney problems. Now he is healthy but he lacks the resources to guarantee an income for his family and paid studies for his children.

She has been working from home ever since she got married over 15 years ago.  After having her first child the household expenses began to increase and the income from her husband's work as a bricklayer was not enough to cover all the family's needs.  She was initially able to see a business opportunity in running a Nixtamal mill.  Then she bought a grill to make pupusas (stuffed tortillas) which she sold on the week ends.  On the other days she was able to sell tortillas.  She gets up very early every morning to prepare what she needs to make the tortillas.  Her first customers begin arriving at 7:00 a.m. and before that she has to get the children dressed and off to school.  The youngest two are in 1st and 6th grade and the oldest goes off to another community to study 9th grade.\r\n\r\nCorn is the main raw material for Mirna and she buys it from the producers in the area.  She buys her other supplies in the city with is 15 kilometers away so she either takes the only available bus or rides in a pick-up truck that covers the route.\r\n  \r\nThe loan she is requesting through Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy corn and have enough inventory for the rainy season.  She also will buy other products such as coffee, dairy products, sausage, beans, rice, sugar, etc. to sell to her customers when they come for the tortillas.  She also wants to plant seven acres of corn crop.\r\n\r\nWith this investment she hopes to expand and grow her business because the opportunity is there and she believes her expenses will increase as her children advance in school.  Her oldest daughter has to continue high school in the city and Mirna wants all her children to continue their education.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she and her husband want to build a new brick house on a lot they received from the government.  Now they live in an adobe house with a cement wall that they built on land that belonged to a ranch but was abandoned.  Several families with low incomes have built their houses there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1374260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is secretary to the group \"LAS GARDENIAS\", which is made up of 6 hard working borrowers who have already been through 11 loan cycles.\n\nElizabeth has worked as a street trader selling food for 15 years. In her spare time she provides laundry services. This is how she helps her husband with the household costs.

They all live in traditional families in N'Tjila, one of the villages of Niena in the rural commune of Wateni, Sikasso, the third administrative region in Mali. They are working with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to carry out their farming during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe group is on their fifth loan with the institution, and all of their previous loans have been repaid.\r\n\r\nNassira, standing in the middle of the photo, grows ground nuts and corn.

In particular, his family has a plot of agricultural land where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested nuts locally at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nGenadi requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Genadi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Genadi will purchase a milking cow. After purchasing a milking cow, he will produce cheese to sell. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

With new structure, she hopes the quality and quantity of her pigs will increase. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to the group members for the support, and thanks the Kiva lenders for partnering with them despite being in a very remote area.\r\n\r\nIn the picture are 25 members who all signed the waiver form because they all belong to the group; some are not taking loans this cycle, but intend to take loans during the next cycle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":1372014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials to build an improved pig sty.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-06-21T15:10:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-21T15:10:21Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celesensio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lauben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vereriyano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gastone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Denis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doreen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jonan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":941666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":941666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":941667,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":942489.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689653},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":941666,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":942488.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480784},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":941667.01,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":942489.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879936},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":941666.99,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":942489.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983594},{"amount":344.03,"local_amount":893686,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":894466.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635708},{"amount":380.97,"local_amount":989647,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":990510.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863162}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T18:35:17Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:59:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":573002,"name":"Tasleem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A loan of 40,000 PKR would help Tasleem  to meet the  cost of repairing her home.

He purchases a variety of fresh vegetables from the field and sells them at a profitable price. \r\n\r\nPresently he is interested to offer more variety to his customers which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However due to lack of funds, he finds it difficult. Therefore his wife, Bashiran, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to purchase onions, potatoes, tomatoes and carrots from the field and sell them at a profitable price. With the profit her husband wants to grow his business in the future.
