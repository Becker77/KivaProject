At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nYolanda operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from round palm sized ones to the much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, they are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler as you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. \r\n\r\nYolanda hopes to expand her business and dreams to have their own house and lot. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

invest in supplies and tools to enlarge the sheds where he raises his pigs and to acquire more animals to increase his sales which will make it possible for him to continue with his studies without

Como a su compa\u00f1ero de vida le daban un d\u00eda de descanso, aprovecharon ese d\u00eda y lo destinaban a destazar, manifiesta que hacen esta actividad cada 15 d\u00edas y que gracias a Dios le genera ingresos adicionales para su familia     \n\nellos compran los animales para destazo en la misma comunidad la mayor\u00eda de veces con productores de la zona y algunas veces le toca que ir a las plazas mas comunes de semovientes en la ciudad  generando gastos adicionales ya que paga transporte para que le lleven el animal hasta la casa.\n\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para cancelar un saldo pendiente con la instituci\u00f3n  y el resto sera invertido en la compra de ganado bovino para destazo ya que visualizan una oportunidad de negocio en esta actividad; ya que muchos de sus clientes les preguntan por carnes y otros cortes derivados de reses pocas veces lo han hecho por que es mas dif\u00edcil comprar una res ya que es mas cara que un cerdo.\n\n\nCon la inversi\u00f3n,  aumentara el negocio es cierto sera mas trabajo pero haciendo buenas compras se puede sacar ganancias y generar mas ingresos que garanticen primero la estabilidad econ\u00f3mica de la familia, que garantize la satisfacci\u00f3n y retencion de los clientes y que se viva de diferente manera, para su familia por que hoy que tienen ya dos hijas el salario no ajusta para cubrir los gastos de la canasta b\u00e1sica alimentaria como cuando eran solo ellos dos ahora deben mandar a la escuela a la ni\u00f1a mayor y bueno ya pronto la otra ni\u00f1a tendr\u00e1 la edad y deber\u00e1 ir a la escuela \n\n\nEn un futuro esperan que el negocio  siga mejorando y ya no hacerlo cada 15 d\u00edas; si no una vez por semana que las ni\u00f1as estudien y salgan adelante y lleguen a tener una carrera profesional,  hacer mejoras a la casa y porque no hacerla de ladrillo o de bloque ya que ahora la casa es de lamina y bahareque    \n","en":"Ana is 41 years old, she has a partner and two daughters who are 4 and 10 years old. She learned her butchering skills because she she needed to earn money for her family, since her partner's income as a day laborer were not enough to cover household expenses. Since her partner got at least one day off of work, they took advantage of this day and dedicated it to developing butchering skills. She has been doing this every 15 days and thanks to God she has been able to generate additional income for her family. \r\n\r\nThey buy animals to butcher from their local community, most of the time from local producers and other times she goes to the livestock plazas in the city, but this costs her extra money because she has to pay for transportation so that she can get the animals back to her house. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for from Fundacion Campo is to pay the balance with another institution and the rest she will use to purchase livestock for her butcher shop because a good opportunity has presented itself to her. Many of her customers are asking her for her cuts of meat and other cuts that she doesn't have as often because it is difficult to purchase a cow because it is much more expensive than a pig. \r\n\r\nWith this investment, her business will grow, and there will surely be more work but by making smart purchases she will be able to earn higher profits and to generate a higher income that will help her to guarantee economic stability for her family. It will also guarantee the satisfaction and retention of her customers and that she is able to live in a different way.  Today, their current income doesn't allow them to purchase even enough of the basic necessities for herself and her two daughters and her older daughter is going to school now and has school costs, and the younger daughter will also have school costs soon and they want her to go to school. \r\n\r\nIn the future, they hope that their business continues to improve and they can do it more than every 15 days, but rather, once a week so that their daughters can study and continue to get ahead in life and to have a professional career, as well as make improvements to her house because they would like a house made of brick but currently it is made of laminate. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1374309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase cattle.

He lives in Senaki District with his 35-year-old wife and 10-year-old daughter. Roman requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is out of a source of income at the moment.\r\n\r\nRoman requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Roman will start trading with fruits and vegetables. He has a car. He will purchase the products at the wholesale price and resell them among the villagers and in the nearby village with a price markup. This will give him an opportunity to earn some income for the family. Roman will reinvest part of the profit. Another part will be used for ensuring a better life for his young daughter.

Elba's farm is certified with the Fair Trade seal, which proves it's compliance with economic, worker, and environmental criteria that this certification requires, in addition to a contribution to the economic development of her community.\r\n\r\nIn the last three cycles she has harvested 70, 120, and 48 quintals [approximately 3,220, 5,520, and 2,208 kilograms respectively] of pergamino coffee. The diminished harvest of her farm in the 2012-2013 cycle was due to the spread of the roya fungus [coffee-leaf rust] in the country. This is disease has a great impact on coffee agriculture. This diminished harvest together with the fall in price in this sector has diminished her liquidity. This is why she has decided to request a loan to take on a comprehensive management plan of her farm.\r\n\r\nWith these resources, this entrepreneur will be able to invest in the purchase of preventative and restorative fungicides as well as supplies to fertilize her coffee farm in order to achieve stability in her harvest production.

He is married and has one child, aged 12 years old. He has one additional dependent living with him.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Daramy established his tailoring business. He began his business because he wanted to improve himself and his family. Working six days a week and ten hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,500,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan of SLL 5,000,000. Daramy requires this loan to buy an industrial tailoring machine, which produces different tailoring designs.

Arsen requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nArsen\u2019s mother is working at the local social department; his sisters are working at the local kindergarten as a teacher and at the beauty salon, respectively. They all earn small monthly salaries, which is rarely enough to cover the monthly expenses and raise two children. \r\n\r\nArsen requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Arsen has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Arsen will open a Georgian bread bakery. He will renovate the area that he has, purchase all the needed equipment and raw materials and start baking the bread. \r\n\r\nArsen used to work as a distributor before, and he knows most of the shops around his district. He already has agreed with the owners that he will distribute his bread to them. Arsen will have a good number of clients and earn good profit for his family. With the increased income, Arsen will be able to ensure a better life for his children and improve the family's living conditions.

She has an elementary school education.  Along with her partner, she cultivates corn, beans, and coffee.  Her three children are still small and attend elementary school, but they help with some of the household activities and with some of the farming tasks, such as clearing the land.  Thanks to her father, Maria learned to work the land, because both she and her partner come from farming families.  Maria and her partner work land that they own, thanks to the effort and dedication that they have put into their work for many years.  The land is located one kilometer from their house.  Maria and her partner sell the products that they cultivate in the local market, and also to some buyers that come to the area to buy products.\r\n\r\nNow, Maria is requesting a loan from COMIXMUL to buy certified corn seeds and fertilizers, because the land is ready for planting, and she will use these supplies to plant and care for the crops.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Maria plans to continue to cultivate a variety of crops so that she can offer more to her customers and to others who come to her property to buy, and also sell more in the local market.

Ararat requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from trading in vegetables and greens. They have a counter at the local market and sell the products themselves. Their additional income is Ararat\u2019s son\u2019s monthly salary; he is working at the local beer factory.\r\n\r\nArarat requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ararat has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Ararat will start trading in clothes. He will purchase clothes at wholesale prices and resell them from his counter at the local market.

sons and a daughter. All of his children are going to school. Vaginak requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow and calf. The cow is milked every day to produce dairy products. The family also owns a plot of agricultural land where potatoes, barley and wheat are grown. The entire harvested product and the dairy products are sold at the local markets.\r\n\r\nVaginak requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Vaginak has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Vaginak will start trading fruits and vegetables. He has a mini-bus that will be used for trading. Vaginak will purchase stocks of products and sell them among the villagers and at the local markets. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will give Vaginak an opportunity to significantly increase the family income, improve the living conditions and also insure future studying for his children.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1373061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Mamia will purchase stocks of groceries to open a grocery shop.

Zimbabwe. She is married with one child. She also cares for one other dependent.\r\n\r\nMarjorie runs a retail business selling butternuts, oranges and bananas. The business has been in operation for 13 years. She says the main challenge being faced is that of some competitors who reduce prices thereby triggering price wars.

dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles. Christian reside en Chillogallo un barrio ubicado en el sector sur de la ciudad, un sector con una alta actividad comercial que es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y que aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios como es el caso de Christian, un hombre 27 a\u00f1os que al haber terminado la secundaria se dedic\u00f3 al comercio primero como empleado y luego independientemente. Christian est\u00e1 casado con Mar\u00eda una mujer de su misma edad dedicada los quehaceres del hogar y con quien tiene el privilegio de haber concebido un par de gemelas que en la actualidad tienen un poco m\u00e1s de 2 a\u00f1os y el d\u00eda de su nacimiento fue muy especial pues al nacer prematuras permanecieron un tiempo den incubadora pero salieron sanas y sin mayores inconvenientes; esto motiv\u00f3 a\u00fan m\u00e1s a Christian para seguir adelante. \nChristian trabajaba como vendedor en una empresa privada, sin embargo sus clientes siempre le recomendaban independizarse, pues \u00e9l conoc\u00eda muy bien sobre los productos que vend\u00eda, por lo que hace un a\u00f1o Christian decidi\u00f3 emprender con su propia microempresa de comercio de productos desechables como platos, cucharas, fundas, tarrinas, etc. en todos los tama\u00f1os para satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes que cada vez son m\u00e1s; pues en un inicio, \u00e9l hab\u00eda comenzado a vender y entregar su producto en las tiendas de las escuelas y colegios y luego fue ampliando poco a poco su negocio hasta tener su propio local donde puede vender otro tipo de art\u00edculos. Christian invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en el desempe\u00f1o de su trabajo, desde que se levanta para distribuir y clasificar los pedidos hasta que termina la tarde contabilizando las cuentas por cobrar y las cuentas que le pagaron en el d\u00eda. Ahora que este joven padre ha ganado experiencia y tiene pleno conocimiento de su mercado, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo con nuevos productos como son los pa\u00f1ales y art\u00edculos para beb\u00e9 y de esta forma amplia su cartera de productos y clientes para ofrecer a su familia un mejor estilo de vida con estabilidad laboral y econ\u00f3mica. Christian agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por creer en sus sue\u00f1os y brindarle la confianza y asesor\u00eda que necesita para saber administrar su negocio y cumplir sus sue\u00f1os y los de su familia.","en":"Not long ago, the southern sector of the city of Quito was not considered one of the stronger economic sectors of the capital of the Republic of Ecuador. Now, this sector is considered a strength of the city's economy. In this place, you can find families who have fought to survive. Between indigenous people and migrants from other cities and countries, it has been a meeting point for inhabitants of various provinces and it has been reconstructed with extensive streets. \r\n\r\nChristian lives in Chillogallo, a neighborhood located in the southern sector of the city, a sector with a high amount of commercial activity that is becoming stronger and stronger, and that contributes greatly to the economic growth of the city. In this sector, there are many parks with large green spaces in which many families spend their weekends. Many different services are available, and the people who live there are businesspeople like Christian who take advantage of every opportunity to establish new businesses. \r\n\r\nChristian, a 27-year-old high school graduate, worked in the commercial sector first as an employee and later independently. He is married to Maria, who is the same age and who completes the household tasks. They have the privilege of having twin girls who are now a little over two years old. The day of their birth was a very special day because they were born prematurely and needed to remain in an incubator for a while. They are now healthy and without major health issues. This further motivates Christian to move forward.\r\n\r\nChristian worked as a salesman in a private business, but his clients always encouraged him to become independent since he knew the products that he was selling very well. A year ago, Christian decided to launch his own small business selling disposable goods like plates, spoons, cases, tubs, etc. in all sizes to satisfy the demands of his growing number of clients. In the beginning, he sold and delivered his products in school stores and later increased his business until he now has his own storefront where he can sell other types of items. \r\n\r\nChristian spends at least 8 hours each day performing his job, from the time he wakes up to distribute and classify the orders until he finishes in the afternoon adding up the bills to charge and the bills that were paid that day. \r\n\r\nNow that this young father has gained experience and has full knowledge of his market, he seeks a loan to invest in new products like diapers and items for babies, and increase his portfolio of products and clients in order to offer a better quality of life to his family with economic stability. Christian thanks Fundacion Alternativa for believing in his dreams and giving him the confidence and advice that he needs to know how to manage his business and achieve his and his families' dreams."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1374501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

He lives in a small village in Bolnisi District with his wife, son and daughter-in-law. In the past, Badri has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start-up a family business but without any success. His loan requests have been rejected all the time due to  low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBadri\u2019s wife has a retirement pension and his daughter-in-law works as a teacher at local school. Badri has a plot of agricultural land where cucumbers are grown. He does all the agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. He sells the harvested cucumbers at local markets at a good price. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBadri has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Badri has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

She previously accessed an 8,000 PHP loan that she used for purchasing materials and products needed in manicure and pedicure, like nail polish, nail polish remover, cuticle remover, nail cutter, nail file and other products. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and in their personal, household and business expenditures. She also sells street foods for additional income.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another loan, this time for 10,000 PHP, to buy new equipment and materials needed for her barber shop. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children.

She is married to Abelardo and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGenalen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells fish, pork and vegetables. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nGenalen hopes to expand her business.

Fredis vive con su familia en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nFredis emprendi\u00f3 con la actividad de agricultura desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, espec\u00edficamente con el cacao que es un fruto muy demandado a nivel de empresas exportadoras y tambi\u00e9n fabricantes de chocolates, es por esto que Fredis se dedica con mucho cuidado al mantenimiento de los cultivos lo que le lleva al menos 6 horas todos los d\u00edas, pues al menor descuido, las plantaciones quedar\u00edan arruinados y habr\u00eda mucha p\u00e9rdida.

","en":"Fredis is a 32-year-old man. He was educated up to the end of secondary school and began to work to provide for his household, which is made up of his wife Mercy, who is 33 years old, and their three children. The children attend public school and he hopes to support them until they earn their professional degrees. Fredis lives with his family in Quinind\u00e9, a canton of the province of Esmeraldas, which supplies many cities in Ecuador with products like bananas, cacao, coffee, palm oil, and lumber. In addition, the majority of the inhabitants work in commerce every day in order to make a living, especially since the roads to this canton have been expanded, allowing for a great deal of commercial traffic. Especially on weekends, all kinds of vendors come out to offer their products to potential customers, who are usually from the rural areas, in the outdoor market. Tourism is also an important contribution to this canton, since the natural ecosystem has a large variety of places to visit\u2014waterfalls, freshwater rivers, forests\u2014that have flowers and animals that adorn this city.\r\n\r\nFredis began his farming business ten years ago, specifically with cacao, a crop that is very much in demand by export companies and chocolate makers. For this reason, Fredis carefully works at maintaining his crops, which takes at least six hours a day, as a moment's neglect would mean the plantings would be ruined and there would be great losses. With the experience that Fredis has gained in these years of business, he is sure that he is ready to increase his production volume. That's why he is requesting a loan to purchase seeds and fertilizers to properly sow new crops in the plots of land that he has already prepared. Fredis is sure that with this increase, he will be able to fill the large orders that he gets and thereby obtain greater earnings, enabling his business continue to grow and be recognized in the area by wholesale buyers of cacao. Fredis has always had trouble meeting the requirements that financial institutions demand in order to grant loans; however, Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa presented the Kiva product, with which it is possible to get the support of various people around the world who want to him to grow in his business venture.

luego se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar para mantener a su familia, ya que desde muy joven decidi\u00f3 establecer un hogar con su pareja Elena que actualmente tiene 34 a\u00f1os y con quien tiene 4 hijos de los cuales 2 est\u00e1n ya estudiando en la escuela primaria en una instituci\u00f3n p\u00fablica. Wilson vive con su familia en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nWilson se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de cacao desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, la falta de empleo lo llev\u00f3 a especializarse en esta fruta para la posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, invierte varias horas todos los d\u00edas a esta labor heredada de varios familiares que tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a la misma actividad. Wilson sue\u00f1a con ver a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales ya que \u00e9l no pudo lograrlo; es por esto que cada d\u00eda se esfuerza para que nunca les falte lo necesario para cumplir con sus estudios. Con la experiencia que ha ganado tanto en la producci\u00f3n como en la comercializaci\u00f3n, Wilson desea ampliar el terreno de cultivos para lo cual requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 semillas, abonos y adem\u00e1s algunas herramientas para mantener en perfecto estado sus cultivos. Wilson espera que con esta inversi\u00f3n sus ganancias se incrementen y as\u00ed poder ofrecer a su familia un estilo de vida c\u00f3modo y de calidad. Este hombre responsable agradece la asesor\u00eda y credibilidad de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y motiva a los inversionistas de Kiva a siempre dejar ese grano de arena que tanto necesitan los emprendedores como \u00e9l, pues muchas veces el estancamiento se da por la falta de capital que en ocasiones se torna imposible conseguir.","en":"Wilson is a man of 31 who graduated high school and then decided to work to support his family.  He had decided when he was very young to settle down with his partner, Elena, 34, with whom he has four children, two of whom are in public grade school.  Wilson lives with his family in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in Esmeraldas Province that provides products like bananas, cacao, coffee, African palm and forest products to various cities in Ecuador, accounting for the livelihood of most of its inhabitants, who work in related business to get ahead.  The area has allowed for a great deal of commercial activity as still more people travel here, especially on weekends, when all manner businesspeople offer their products at markets to potential clients, most of whom tend to be rural farmers.   The natural ecosystem is widely varied throughout the area, so tourism is also a significant to this canton, where people come to see waterfalls, freshwater rivers, and forests with animals and flowers that grace the city.  \r\n\r\nWilson has earned his living producing cacao for ten years.  Lack of work drove him to specialize in growing this crop to sell.  He devotes several hours a day to his profession, which he came by from various relatives who also work in the same business.  Wilson dreams of seeing his children have professions, since he was never able to.  That's why he endeavors every day, so that they lack for nothing they need to finish school. \r\n\r\nUsing his experience both in production and sales Wilson would like to expand his crop fields, so he needs a loan to buy seeds, fertilizer and some tools to keep his crops in perfect condition.  He hopes that with this investment his profits will increase and he can offer his family a life of quality and comfort.  He is a responsible man.  He appreciates Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa's advice and financing, and encourages Kiva lenders to always put in their grain of sand; it's so needed by businesspeople like him who are frequently impeded by lack of capital, which at times makes it impossible for them to succeed.

The women from this community are still in the habit of dressing in their traditional outfits.  These colorful outfits are made by the women themselves.  The traditional fabric with which they make the outfits is called satin.  Also, for accessories they wear a large necklace around their neck, and one cannot miss their earrings.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this community make a living by raising animals and growing corn.  The group \"Rancher\u00eda\" is made up of four members, all of whom are hard-working and responsible women.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Luisa is 64 years old, has been married to Se\u00f1or Francisco for 16 years, and together they form a family with 12 children; 8 men and 4 women. \r\nDo\u00f1a Luisa has made a living by raising, fattening, and selling lambs for 30 years.  Do\u00f1a Luisa buys medium-sized lambs, then raises and fattens them. Later, she sells the lambs to the those who barbecue; the larger and fatter the lamb, the better the pay.  This time she is asking for the loan to buy more lambs.  She does not know the exact quantity because she does not have the prices, but with the extra money she plans to buy feed.  \r\n\r\nShe tells how she began this work: \"My mom also had lambs when I was very young.  Since then I have known how to care for these little animals.  When I started to live with my husband, I wanted to help with the household expenses and education costs.  Since my children were young and I could not go out to work, I dedicated myself to raising lambs.  It was the best option because that way I was keeping an eye on my children.\"\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Luisa's lambs are a very good source of income because her husband is sick and cannot work.  Thus, when they need money she only has to sell her lambs so that they don't suffer financial problems.  However, the trouble that Do\u00f1a Luisa faces is the lack of a good farmyard because without it her little lambs can get sick and die in lower temperatures. Nevertheless, Do\u00f1a Luisa wishes to have more lambs so that she and her husband Francisco can live with peace of mind, and also to pay for Don Francisco's treatment.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Se\u00f1oras Yolanda, Mar\u00eda Luisa, and Manuela are asking for the loan to be able to buy more lambs to raise, fatten, and sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1373561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Rancheria, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":3875,"lender_count":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7430.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7713.69},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8088.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8524.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":8897.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9344.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":597.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":626.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":660.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":689.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":724.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":575.87,"local_amount":7430.64,"processed_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":7436.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698618},{"amount":597.82,"local_amount":7714.08,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":7720.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944829},{"amount":626.89,"local_amount":8089.19,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8095.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227903},{"amount":660.65,"local_amount":8524.76,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8531.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991755},{"amount":689.54,"local_amount":8897.51,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":8904.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644420},{"amount":724.23,"local_amount":9343.82,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9351.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877893}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T01:08:29Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:26:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":573492,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer is married with two children.

padres, donde pudo terminar la escuela primaria, se mud\u00f3 siendo muy joven en busca de mejores oportunidades y se cas\u00f3 con  Mar\u00eda una mujer trabajadora que ahora tiene 54 a\u00f1os y con quien Miguel tuvo 3 hijos quienes son independientes y cada uno ya form\u00f3 su familia. Ahora Miguel vive con su esposa en su casa en Quito la capital de los ecuatorianos, en el barrio llamado \u201cChillogallo\u201d ubicado al sur de la ciudad, sector que hasta hace pocos a\u00f1os no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles, un sector en el cual su alta actividad comercial es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios.\nMiguel aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres la actividad de la agricultura, labor a la que se dedica desde hace 6 a\u00f1os, ya que hab\u00eda falta de empleo en la empresa privada y la necesidad cada vez era m\u00e1s grande; Miguel invierte varias horas todos los d\u00edas incluidos los fines de semana en el peque\u00f1o terreno que en su gran mayor\u00eda tiene cultivos de papas, las cuales comercializa en los principales mercados de la ciudad y del pueblo y tambi\u00e9n recibe ayuda de su esposa quien adem\u00e1s se ocupa de los quehaceres del hogar. Miguel desea incrementar la producci\u00f3n de sus cultivos para lo cual ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de semillas y fertilizantes para el cuidado de la tierra y los cultivos. Con este incremento sus utilidades ser\u00e1n mejores y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 llevar el sustento a su casa y adem\u00e1s mejorar la calidad de vida con su esposa. Miguel es consciente de que con el paso de los a\u00f1os sus fuerzas se debilitar\u00e1n y luego se le dificultar\u00e1 realizar el trabajo que realiza, pero mientras eso suceda, \u00e9l pondr\u00e1 mucho empe\u00f1o en generar utilidades con su negocio y prever\u00e1 un ahorro para las necesidades de salud y sustento que pueda tener en el futuro. Miguel est\u00e1 agradecido por la oportunidad de obtener el cr\u00e9dito con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, quienes adem\u00e1s han demostrado estar preocupados por su crecimiento personal y estabilidad laboral. ","en":"Miguel is a 50 year-old man who grew up living with his parents in a town in the countryside, where he was able to finish elementary school.  He moved when he was very young in search of better opportunities, and he married Maria, a hardworking woman, who is now 54 years old and with whom Miguel has 3 children.  His children are now independent, each one having formed their own family.  Now Miguel lives with his wife in their home in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, in a neighborhood called \"Chillogallo,\" located in the southern part of the city.  This is an area that, until just a few years ago, was not considered to be one of the economic strongholds of the capital of the Republic of Ecuador.  But now this area is considered a force in the economy of the city.  Here, there are enterprising families who have fought to get ahead.  Between the natives, and migrants from other cities and countries, this area has been a meeting place for residents from various provinces.  The area has been rebuilt with extensive streets, and is a neighborhood with a high level of commercial activity that keeps on getting more active, and supports the economic growth of the city in an important way.  This area is outstanding because of its parks and extensive green areas, where families get together on the weekends.  A large variety of services are accessible here, and the residents are entrepreneurs who take advantage of every opportunity that presents itself by launching new businesses.\r\n\r\nMiguel learned to farm from his parents, and he's been doing this work for 6 years because there was no work available in private companies, and his needs were growing over time.  Miguel spends a number of hours each day, including on weekends, working on his small plot of land where he mostly grows potatoes.  He sells his crops in the main markets in the city and town.  He is assisted by his wife, who also carries out the household chores.  \r\n\r\nMiguel wants to increase his production of crops.  To do this, he is requesting a loan to invest in seeds and in fertilizer to care for the crops and the land.  With this increased production his profits will increase, and so he will be able to support his household and also improve his family's quality of life.  Miguel is aware that over time, his strength will diminish and it will become difficult for him to continue to farm, so he is putting a lot of effort into generating profits from his business and he expects to save for his future needs for health and support.

The variety of shawls that she sells, are liked by everyone.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the stock of her shawls is almost finished. Therefore, she is interested in purchasing a variety of products, in different colors, for her business. For that purpose she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. The enlarged inventory will help her to increase her net income, and her savings for the future. She will use the profit for the better education of her children. She is feeling very confident and satisfied after taking this loan, because the profit will help her to manage the household expenses and to meet her children's education

los escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos que en su familia exist\u00edan ya no pudieron apoyarle para continuar sus estudios, por lo que ayudaba a sus padres en las labores de campo y luego se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar para mantener a su familia, ya que desde muy joven decidi\u00f3 establecer un hogar con su pareja Marcia que actualmente tiene 25 a\u00f1os y con quien tiene 2 hijos estudiando en la escuela primaria en una instituci\u00f3n p\u00fablica. Roberto vive con su familia en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nRoberto se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de cacao desde hace 20 a\u00f1os, la falta de empleo lo llev\u00f3 a especializarse en esta fruta para la posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, la aprendi\u00f3 de su familia desde que era un ni\u00f1o e invierte varias horas todos los d\u00edas a esta labor heredada de varios familiares que tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a la misma actividad. Roberto sue\u00f1a con ver a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales ya que \u00e9l no pudo lograrlo; es por esto que cada d\u00eda se esfuerza para que nunca les falte lo necesario para cumplir con sus estudios. Con la experiencia que ha ganado tanto en la producci\u00f3n como en la comercializaci\u00f3n, Roberto desea ampliar el terreno de cultivos para lo cual requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 semillas, fertilizantes y adem\u00e1s algunas herramientas para mantener en perfecto estado sus cultivos. Roberto espera que con esta inversi\u00f3n sus ganancias se incrementen y as\u00ed poder ofrecer a su familia un estilo de vida c\u00f3modo y de calidad. Este hombre responsable agradece la asesor\u00eda y credibilidad de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y motiva a los inversionistas de Kiva a siempre dejar ese grano de arena que tanto necesitan los emprendedores como \u00e9l, pues muchas veces el estancamiento se da por la falta de capital que en ocasiones se torna imposible conseguir.","en":"Roberto, 32, has a primary school education. Due to his family's lack of financial resources, they could not support him to continue his studies, so he helped his parents with the farm labor. He later worked to support his own family, because at a young age he decided to establish a home with his partner, Marcia, 25. They have two children together, who are studying in a public primary school.\r\n\r\nRoberto lives with his family in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in the province of Esmeraldas which provides products such as bananas, cocoa, coffee, African palm, and forest products to various cities in Ecuador. Commerce makes up the daily work for the majority of the canton's inhabitants, allowing them to move ahead. This is especially true now that the routes to the canton have increased, allowing for a great volume of trade movement, particularly on the weekends when all kinds of traders come out to the fairs to offer products to potential clients, who are often farmers. Tourism is also a very important contribution to the canton, because its natural ecosystem offers a great variety of places to visit such as waterfalls, freshwater rivers, forests, and the flowers and animals that one can see in the city.\r\n\r\nRoberto has worked in cocoa production for 20 years. The lack of employment led him to specialize in this fruit, which he later trades. He learned about the business from his family when he was a child. He invests many hours every day in this labor, which he inherited from several relatives who worked in the same business. \r\n\r\nRoberto dreams of seeing his children become professionals, because he was not able to do so. Therefore, he works hard every day so that they lack nothing for their studies. With the experience he has gained in production as well as trade, Roberto would like to expand his farmlands. Therefore, he needs this loan to buy seeds, fertilizer, and some tools to maintain his crops in perfect condition. This responsible man is grateful for the advice and credibility of the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, and he motivates the Kiva lenders to leave that grain of sand which entrepreneurs like him need so badly. Many times, stagnation results from a lack of capital which is sometimes impossible to achieve.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1375094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

Sadia has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase crockery items, like glasses, plates, spoons, forks, etc. for her shop, so that she can offer more variety of goods to her clients. As a result, she hopes to increase her net income in the future. She dreams of opening a new shop for her other two sons. She is hopeful that her business will grow more in the future. She wants to thank all the BRAC staff for being so cooperative."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1373769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

He currently needs to care for his crops, which are two hectares of corn and two of beans.  As a goal, he is planning on generating the maximum harvest from his land.  This way he will have more income when he sells it.  This will help with stability and improved well-being.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan he has received from FUDECOSUR.  He has not previously had other loans with state banks.  FUDECOSUR gave the loan with better terms and a much lower interest rate.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":666.67,"image":{"id":1375179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy supplies to care for his corn and bean crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"El Progreso, Pejibaye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.7,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dagoberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.97,"local_amount":25485.52,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T10:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":25587.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059298},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":3.8,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-20T08:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467916171},{"amount":281.32,"local_amount":141509.39,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":142075.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.7,"payment_id":490830840},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":2.71,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579564243},{"amount":0.06,"local_amount":30.26,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636217095},{"amount":332.6,"local_amount":166301.66,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":166967.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991858}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T06:49:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":573534,"name":"Hadisamo","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0425\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e 43-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u0425\u0430\u0442\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0442\u044e\u0431\u0435 (\u044d\u0442\u043e \u044e\u0433 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b). \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435 24 \u0438 22 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438, \u0430 \u043c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0435. \u0412\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430 -

En varios sectores  de esta provincia, residen familias que se dedican a la agricultura, y muchas veces su esfuerzo no es valorado, pues las empresas pagan costos muy bajos por los frutos que sus tierras producen, sin embargo, el sustento siempre est\u00e1 presente.\nAngel se ha dedicado al comercio en varias \u00e1reas y ha trabajado por siempre dar a sus hijos lo que necesitaban, hace 6 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 emprender independientemente con un negocio de venta de art\u00edculos para uso personal, como vinchas, cepillo y pastas dentales, shampoo, rinse, gel, etc. Este negocio lo ha establecido en un peque\u00f1o pasillo de su casa en el centro de la ciudad e invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en su local y sus clientes son cada vez m\u00e1s con el paso del tiempo, aunque como en todo negocio existen temporadas en las que las ventas son muy bajas. Angel afirma que en este negocio es muy importante contar con la variedad de productos, pues as\u00ed los clientes podr\u00e1n encontrar todo lo que necesitan en el mismo lugar. Este hombre que se ha convertido en un experto por la experiencia y conociiento emp\u00edricos a lo largo de los a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 preparado para crecer con su negocio para lo cual solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la adquisici\u00f3n de perfumes variados para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os que es un producto de alta demanda y con el que hasta el momento no lo ha tenido en su negocio. Angel espera que con este incremento de surtido, sus clientes sean m\u00e1s y por lo tanto sus utilidades se incrementen para de esta forma un d\u00eda poder mejorar la infraestructura de su negocio y ampliar el local.","en":"Angel is a responsible and entrepreneurial person. He is 58 years old, and in spite of only finishing primary school, he has always worked to improve his standard of living. He is single. He has 4 children, all of whom are economically independent and have their own families, but still visit their father periodically. Angel lives alone in Quinind\u00e9, a cant\u00f3n of the province of Esmeraldas, which provides various cities in Ecuador with products such as banana, cacao, coffee, African palm, and forest products. Commerce is the daily work of the majority of the area\u2019s inhabitants. This increased when the roads to the cant\u00f3n were improved, allowing greater commercial movement, especially on the weekends when merchants of all sorts come out to offer their products in the markets to their potential customers, who usually are rural farmers. Tourism is also an important source of income for this cant\u00f3n because its natural ecosystem has a great variety of places to visit, such as waterfalls, rivers, and forests which have flowers and animals that adorn this city. In several areas of the province, families dedicate themselves to agriculture. Many times their effort is not appreciated and business pay very low prices for the products their lands produce. Even so, this way of life is always present.\r\n\r\nAngel has worked in commerce in various places and he always worked to give his children what they needed. Six years ago, he decided to start his own business selling personal products, such as headbands, brushes, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, hair gel, etc. He established his business in a small corridor in his house in the center of the city, and he spends at least 8 hours per day in his store. He has more and more customers as time goes by, though, as with all businesses, there are periods when sales are slow. Angel explains that in this business it is very important to have a good variety of products so that the customers can find everything they need in one place. He has become an expert through experience and empirical knowledge  through the years, and now he is prepared to grow his business. In order to do this he is requesting a loan that he will use to buy a variety of perfumes for women, men, and children, which is a product that is in high demand and which, until now, he has not had in his business. Angel hopes that with this addition to his inventory his number of customers will grow and that his income will also grow so that one day he will be able to improve his business\u2019s infrastructure and expand the store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1375138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfumes for women, men, and children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quinind\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel Ramiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":652.73,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":102.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":105.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":107.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":109.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":112.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":114.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":215.7,"local_amount":208.58,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":215.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565418},{"amount":111.14,"local_amount":107.48,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":111.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814456},{"amount":111.65,"local_amount":107.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":111.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320629},{"amount":118.19,"local_amount":114.29,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":118.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856319},{"amount":118.32,"local_amount":114.41,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":118.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059894}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T11:50:10Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":573565,"name":"Joint Effort For Rural Dev't Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yeremiya is a member of  the above-mentioned group, in which each one guarantees the other in accessing a loan.

She had the opportunity to complete secondary school and then began to work for herself. She lives in the parish of R\u00edo Verde, a historical place in Santo Domingo, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, an Ecuadorean province that in the last few years has had a high, sustained amount of growth. Its capital is a city where the most attractive and notable thing is its delicious fruit and the gastronomy available there. It also has a considerable amount of trade, since it has become a terrestrial port of exchange between the mountainous and coastal regions of the country. It also has various tourist attractions that, accompanied by its warm climate, are very busy with national and foreign tourists. It is for this reason that the majority of its inhabitants have started some kind of commercial or service activity for locals and tourists.\r\n\r\nMaritza always helped her mother making athletic clothing, and she learned a lot about this work. She has worked with her mother, earning part of her income, and through it covering her necessities. Four years ago, she decided to go independent, looking for new customers and making clothing. Nevertheless, she had to go to her mother to use her sewing machine. Now Maritza is asking for a loan to acquire her own sewing machine and dedicate herself full time to making athletic clothing. With her sewing machine it will be easier to allocate her time waiting on customers, producing, and designing. Since it is her first loan, she had difficulty getting support from financial institutions until someone recommended Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to her.

In particular, she has a plot of land where nut trees are grown.  In addition, she has an agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNatela requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business.  Natela has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.  These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.  With this credit Natela will purchase a milking cow.  After the milking cow is purchased she will be able to produce dairy products for sale.

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan along her husband and three daughters.  Her husband is a government employee but his income is insufficient to meet the household expenses.  All of her daughters are studying in government schools. \r\n\r\nNageena is an efficient beautician by profession.  Since 2006 she has been operating her own beauty salon.  Currently the beauty stock of the salon is almost depleted, therefore Nageena wants to purchase cosmetic products to continue her business.  For that, as a member of a 2-person borrower group she has requested for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase beauty products like facial creams, lipsticks, scrubs, makeup kits, hair colors and some other variety of products.  She would also buy some new chairs for her salon. \r\n\r\nWith the profits, she will extend her business more by opening one more beauty salon.  She dreams to live a happy healthy and peaceful life with her family. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their support. \r\n\r\nNote: In the picture Nageena is the one raising her

Este joven realiza dos actividades productivas; la primera pero no la menos importante es la crianza de aves de corral  (pollos de engorde), la segunda es la crianza de ganado como son: vacas, chivas, terneras y toros, estas actividades las ejerce en un terreno que se encuentra anexo a su casa de habitaci\u00f3n. Este terreno cuenta con todos las condiciones para la crianza de pollos y ganado bovino, por la ma\u00f1ana limpia los comederos de los pollos y del ganado. Luego les da su alimento, en el trascurso del d\u00eda, cuida que todo se encuentre en perfectas condiciones ya que los pollos requieren de mucho cuidado ya que son unas aves muy delicadas. Cuenta aproximadamente con un promedio de 3 a\u00f1os de ejercer esta actividad. Tambi\u00e9n cabe mencionar que su mama desde hace mas de 30 a\u00f1os ha ejercido esta actividad y es ella quien lo orienta para que todo le salga muy bien. Antes de dedicarse a esta actividad estaba estudiando; pero por problemas econ\u00f3micos ya no sigui\u00f3 los estudios universitarios.      \n\nLos pollos de engorde, los compra a los proveedores de productos que son los especialistas en la crianza de pollos, ellos prestan un servicio agregado que son las revisiones semanales o quincenales para ver c\u00f3mo va el crecimiento de los pollos. Estos los compran en la ciudad, que se encuentra a una distancia de 1 kil\u00f3metro de su casa de habitaci\u00f3n.\nEl ganado bovino es comprado en el tiangue de la misma ciudad que tambi\u00e9n se encuentra en la misma distancia anteriormente dicha.    \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo,  es para comprar 300 pollos de engorde.\n2 vacas lecheras, 2 terneras, el resto del financiamiento ser\u00e1 invertido en el arreglo de la maya cicl\u00f3n de donde se encuentran los pollos ya que est\u00e1 en mal estado.  \n\n      Con el cr\u00e9dito incrementara su hato de ganado y la crianza de 300 pollos de engorde ya que actualmente cuenda con otros 300 que ya est\u00e1n listos para la venta. Al comprar todos estos pollos y el ganado incrementaran sus inventarios y por ende la ventas ser\u00e1n mayores y por supuesto sus ganancias tambi\u00e9n y de esta manera podr\u00e1 hacer otras inversiones que tiene pensado.  \n\nSus prop\u00f3sitos, en primer lugar quiere construir una galera m\u00e1s para la crianza de los pollos debido a que la que tiene actualmente es muy peque\u00f1a y est\u00e1 bastante en mal estado, tambi\u00e9n la construcci\u00f3n de comederos y bebederos para el ganado. Y por \u00faltimo quiere seguir estudiando una carrera universitaria.   \n","en":"Rudy is 21 years old. He is single. This young man engages in two kinds of productive work: the first, but not least important, is raising poultry (broiler chickens). The second is raising livestock such as cows, goats, calves, and bulls. He does both of these on a piece of land attached to his house. This land has everything necessary to raise chickens and cows. In the morning, he cleans the troughs of the chickens and cows. Then he feeds them. Throughout the day, he maintains everything he encounters in perfect condition, since the chickens require a lot of care because they are very delicate birds. He has been doing this work for an average of approximately 3 years. It is also worth mentioning that his mother has done this work for more than 30 years, and it is she who points him in the right direction so everything goes very well for him. Before starting this work, he was studying, but due to financial problems he is no longer pursuing university studies.\r\n\r\nHe buys the broiler chickens from the providers who specialize in raising chickens. They provide an added service of weekly or bimonthly checks to see how the chickens\u2019 growth is going. He buys these in the city, which is 1 kilometer from his house.\r\n\r\nHe buys the cows at the small market in the same city that is the same distance away as mentioned previously.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 300 broiler chickens, 2 milk cows, and 2 calves. The rest of the financing will be used to repair the chain-link fence where the chickens are, since it is in bad shape.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, he will increase his herd of cattle and raise 300 broiler chickens, since he currently has 300 others that are ready for sale. His inventory will increase on buying all these chickens and therefore his sales will be larger and of course his earnings as well. In this way, he will be able to make other investments he is thinking of.\r\n\r\nHis goals are: first, he wants to build one more coop to raise the chickens, since the one he currently has is very small and is in pretty bad shape. He also wants to build feed and water troughs for the cattle. And finally, he wants to continue studying for a university degree.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1375155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 300 broiler chickens, 2 milk cows, and 2 calves.

She then sorts them by species and size, and finally she puts them up for sale by the kilo, often tripling her initial investment. She works alone, and she sells the fish after obtaining them from already established providers. Her customers vary between casual customers and fish traders from the city. Her main tool to gain customers is her great charisma and eloquence. She has been doing this work for 10 years, and she has learned a lot about the management of fish and its seasons. Because of this, she has become an excellent administrator of her business, and she always receives a good profit from her work. She likes what she does, and she has a good income, although her only irritation is not to have a fixed place to sell. For this reason, she has to sell in the same place where she acquires the fish, which depends on the fishing day.

Specifically, they have three milking cows whose milk is used to make cheese products. In addition, they have a vineyard with 1200 wine trees. They pick grapes seasonally and produce wine to sell. They sell wine and cheese locally at a good price. However, there is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIvane has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business and he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high risk borrowers because of their low income. With his credit, Ivane will purchase a minibus and will begin trade with groceries. He will transport groceries to sell with his minibus to different villages.  This will be an additional source of income for his large family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.
