She is married to Reynaldo and is a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nMelencia maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business.\r\n\r\nMelencia hopes to grow her business and have more branches. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1373879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional supplies and merchandise products like clothing, footwear, undergarments and cosmetics needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381670266},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2859.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534800},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784195},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1143.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771188}],"funded_date":"2013-06-23T05:04:16Z","paid_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":573638,"name":"Norol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norol is 48 years old, married and has eight children, four of whom are in school.

For 10 years she has been working in business, selling women\u2019s dresses, footwear, perfume, and toiletries.  The idea to start a business came to her at a very young age because she liked having her own income and managing her own money. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why as an adult, when she saw that as a business woman one of her friends was successful and able to support her family with her income, Diana decided to do the same.  At first, her cousin lent her money.  She bought merchandise and sold it to several different customers.  In a matter of 3 months, she was able to pay her cousin back and make a profit. \r\n\r\nThese days, she works selling her main products which are clothing, women\u2019s footwear, and other miscellaneous items.  Her business is going very well.  She is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first time financing through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to purchase personal orders at special discounts for her best customers.  She will buy footwear, facial powders, creams, and perfumes which are featured in her catalogues.  Such an investment will impact her customers\u2019 pockets because she will be able to offer good prices.

Imeda has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard and a plot of land, where maize is grown. They sell the harvested maize and wine locally at a good price. It is hardly enough for the family's food expenses. According to Credo estimations, his family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\nImeda has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Imeda has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Imeda will begin trading with fruits and vegetables. He plans to purchase a stock of fruits and vegetables, which will be transported by his minibus for resale at higher prices. This will help to increase the income of his family. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of Imeda's family.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day. She is requesting a Php10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. Erlinda hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams to have good health. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Zurab has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Zurab will purchase a car to drive it as a taxi.

He lives in the small village of Lagodekhi District with his wife, brother and pensioner parents. Gocha has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of the family's income is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where they grow tomatoes, watermelons and eggplants. They sell the harvested products at local markets. Besides this, Gocha has a tractor which is rented out seasonally. It is hardly enough for the family's food expenses. According to Credo estimations, his family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\nGocha has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Gocha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Gocha will purchase a minibus. After the minibus is purchased, he will be able to begin trading with fruits and vegetables. This will help increase the income of their family. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of Gocha's family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1373924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a minibus for trading fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tsisplistskaro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T06:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T06:10:01Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gocha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":289.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":301.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":308.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":316.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":321.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":330.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":335.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":343.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":353.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":358.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":366.64},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":373.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":321.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":330.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":335.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.18},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Devashini Satiananden","image":401253}},{"id":573671,"name":"Gulfam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulfam is a 54-years-old hardworking and diligent woman.

","en":"Abdukudus is a man of 49. He is a punctual and very active person. He is married with four children. The older sons help him in his business. His wife works at home, taking care of the younger children. They have a large and happy family. Previously, they lived in the village, but when the kids were grown, they bought a house in the city and relocated. In the city, Abdukudus began his own business. He has a small stall in the local market. He trades food products (candy, biscuits, sweets). Abdukudus really likes this type of work because from it he receives a good income.\r\n \r\nAt the moment, he wants to expand his activities and to buy an assortment of different sweets. Abdukudus decided to apply for a loan and approached Arvand, because he doesn't have enough cash on hand. He very much hopes that Arvand will help and support him in difficult

They are working with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso with the goal of better organizing their activities at the start of the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThey grow, among other things, ground nuts, millet, and beans. They are on their third loan with the institution. \r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Karia, the first person seated on the left, plans to buy farm inputs, small pieces of equipment and to pay for the cost of labor to maintain about 2 hectares of millet and ground nuts. \r\n\r\nAfter the harvest, the crops are sold in the town of Beleco to customers who are men and women. Karia hopes to earn about 110,000 francs CFA per

He lives in Kesalo village, Gardabani district with his 50 year old wife, 27 year old son and retired mother in-law.  Viladin requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success.  His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 milk cows.  The cows are milked everyday to produce dairy products.  The products are sold at the local markets and among the villagers.  The family has additional income from Viladin\u2019s mother in-law\u2019s monthly pension. \r\n\r\nViladin requested loan from Credo to start up a family business.  Viladin has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.  These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Viladin will purchase a mini-bus.  Kesalo is a small village and the nearest market is in Gardabani district.  It\u2019s hard for the local people to travel there to buy the daily products as there are not many transports going in that direction.  Viladin will drive the bus to transport his villagers to Gardabani center, where they can purchase all the needed products.  Viladin will start earning additional income for the family and also will help his villagers to have better access to the city.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

","en":"Toir is a 20 years old young man. He is single and lives with his parents, sister and brother in the city of Dushanbe. Toir is a herdsman. He helps his father with breeding cattle. He also has a dairy cow with a calf, which he looks after himself. Every morning his mother milks the cow, and sells the five liters of milk to her customers. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Toir would like to start his own livestock breeding business, as he has now acquired sufficient experience in this business. He intends to purchase around three heads of cattle per month, and after having fattened them, sell them at the local market with a good profit. \r\n\r\nToir has a starting capital of the amount of around 7,000 somoni (TJS). Nonetheless, he needs to take a loan. For the loan amount and the savings, Toir would like to purchase three bulls and their fodder, and also expand the cowshed and carry out repair work there. He will appreciate the support very much. Thanks to the loan he will finally have his own business and expand it in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1374703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

To get income for her family, Kuldar works with livestock breeding and growing of agricultural crops - beans, peppers and wheat. She started this business with the purchase of two cows. Thanks to persistent work, Kuldar currently has two heads of cattle with offspring, 15 sheep and goats and 1.80 hectares of rented land on her farm.

With the 1000 nuevos soles requested, she will buy kitchenware such as pots, plates, glasses, and more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1375343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy kitchenware such as pots, plates, glasses, and more","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":156.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":151.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":165.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":177.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":182.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.66,"local_amount":156.43,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":161.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975877},{"amount":56.83,"local_amount":151.55,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":156.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997196},{"amount":61.96,"local_amount":165.21,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":170.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864663},{"amount":62.39,"local_amount":166.37,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":171.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353033},{"amount":66.59,"local_amount":177.58,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":182.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904796},{"amount":68.57,"local_amount":182.86,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":188.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090803}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T20:40:57Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T11:04:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jamie Schau","image":1143325}},{"id":573791,"name":"Evelynline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelynline lives in Kakata Town, the capital city of Margibi County that is the highest producing rubber plantation in Liberia.

","en":"Dilorom is a young woman of the age of 33 years. She was born and grew up in the city of Isfara. She is divorced and has one daughter. The daughter is still young and goes to kinder-garden. Dilorom lives together with her parents. They are a large family, and each one has their own business. Therefore she has to make a living for herself. \r\n\r\nAfter her husband left her, Dilorom started looking for work. She got a job as a saleswoman in a small store. Over time, when she had learned to do trade, she started her own business. Dilorom purchases seafood (fish) in the city of Khujand and sells it in the local quarters of Isfara.

They live together in their own home. Mar\u00eda makes her living selling shoes and sandals whether on a fortnightly or a monthly basis, depending on the demand for her products. To obtain her merchandise, Mar\u00eda travels to another city by bus for more than 20 hours, from there, she makes the same journey bringing a large quantity of articles to sell to her relatives, friends and others. The designs that she brings back are the latest style, exclusive and of a high quality, which is why she manages to sell the whole lot in a short amount of time. \r\n\r\nShe sells in the streets, covering the main streets of her city every day in the hunt for customers who want to buy something in her range, or who on occasions make advance orders. Ever since she started this business, it has gone very well for her thanks to her charisma and the quality of each of the items she sells. What she likes most about her job is selling, and she is very happy when her merchandise runs out.

She stitches for the people of her community and uses the income to support her entire family. However, due to lack of availability of funds, she is unable to meet the daily demands of her customers.

colegio p\u00fablico, para Carmen fue muy dif\u00edcil tener que afrontar la responsabilidad de educar sola a sus hijos luego de haberse separado de su esposo con quien comparti\u00f3 muchos a\u00f1os, sin embargo no permiti\u00f3 que las circunstancias negativas afectaran su vida y ha salido adelante con sus hijos y su esfuerzo. Actualmente Carmen vive con sus dos hijos en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nCarmen desde hace 8 a\u00f1os se desempe\u00f1a como agricultora en un terreno que posee en su casa en donde tiene un terreno en el que cultiva cacao un fruto que es considerado como uno de los m\u00e1s significativos s\u00edmbolos del Ecuador, pues es considerado uno de los principales exportadores de cacao. El trabajo que realiza Carmen en sembrar las semillas y cuando \u00e9stas dan fruto entonces clasifica el fruto para venderlo en el mercado y a las familias y las  pepas luego de un per\u00edodo de fermentaci\u00f3n son las que producen el cacao con el que se elabora el m\u00e1s delicioso chocolate que alguien haya probado. Los granos de cacao, una vez secos, se tuestan al fuego en una sart\u00e9n y luego se pelan. A continuaci\u00f3n, dichos granos se muelen, obteniendo as\u00ed el cacao en polvo. Sin embargo antes de todo este proceso, el cuidado de las plantaciones tambi\u00e9n es muy importante, es por esto que Carmen solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar abono con el cual le pueda dar un cuidado de calidad a sus  cultivos y as\u00ed obtener frutos con las caracter\u00edsticas que buscan sus clientes. Para Carmen fue muy complicado obtener un cr\u00e9dito para este fin, sin embargo acudi\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde le brindaron la asesor\u00eda y agilidad correspondientes que ella siempre busc\u00f3, ahora sabe que muchas personas estar\u00e1n involucradas en la obtenci\u00f3n de sus sue\u00f1os de ser una microempresaria exitosa y poder dar a sus hijos la educaci\u00f3n que ella no pudo obtener y verlos convertidos en profesionales de excelencia. ","en":"Carmen, 37, has two children who attend public school.  It was hard for Carmen to have to face the responsibility of educating her children alone after separating from her husband of many years.  Nevertheless, she didn't allow the negative circumstances to affect her life, and she has gotten ahead with her children and her effort.\r\n\r\nCurrently Carmen lives with her two children in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in Esmeralda Province that provides several cities in Ecuador with products such as bananas, cacao, coffee, African palm, and forest products.  In addition, the majority of the residents work in daily commerce so they can get ahead, especially since they have expanded the roads to this canton.  This allows a lot of commercial mobility, particularly on the weekend when all types of merchants come out to sell their products at the fair to potential customers, mainly farmworkers.  Tourism is also a a very important contribution of this canton because its natural ecosystem has a variety of places to visit: waterfalls, fresh water rivers, and forests that have flowers and animals that adorn this city.\r\n\r\nCarmen has farmed a plot of land at her house for eight years.  She grows cacao, a product that's considered one of the most significant symbols of Ecuador, one of the main exporters of cacao.  Carmen's job is planting the seeds, and when they bear fruit she arranges for its sale in the market and to families.  After a period of fermentation, the seeds produce the cacao, which is used to make the most delicious chocolate anyone has eaten.\r\n\r\nOnce dried, the cacao beans are toasted in a frying pan and then peeled.  Next, the beans are ground to a powder.  Nevertheless, before this whole process, farm care is also very important.  This is why Carmen's requesting a loan to buy soil amendments to give her crops quality care and produce a bean with the characteristics her customers are looking for.  It was very complicated for Carmen to obtain a loan for this.  Nevertheless, she went to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa where they gave her the advice and diligence she always sought.\r\n\r\nNow she knows that a lot of people will be involved in realizing her dream of being a successful micro-entrepreneur and being able to give her children the education she wasn't able to have and seeing them become excellent professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1375265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She has five children. One year ago she began a business of selling bedding. She buys bed sheets and covers in bulk from the market, and sells them to the people of her community at reasonable prices. She wants to see her business grow and carry out a new investment, but she needs capital. For this reason, she requested a loan of Rs 50,000.

age 38, is a hard-working married woman. She started her business of buying and selling animals three years ago, to support her household and to provide a better future for her children. She buys animals (baby goats & baby cows) at low prices, brings them up and then sells them out in the market, at higher prices.

working hard and through the many problems that can emerge in an agricultural business. Susanna has a small and well-run farm. She keeps two cows, two bulls, two piglets, 12 sheep and 25 chickens. As a result of working night and day, Susanna manages to sell some meat, dairy products and eggs, right from her house to her loyal customers and neighbors. A plot of land that she owns also brings a little income to her family; from her fruit garden she manages to sell apples and apricots.\r\n\r\nSusanna and her family live in the village Ddmashen, which is in the Gegharkunik area. Susanna\u2019s husband is in the Russian Federation working abroad. From time to time, he helps his family financially. Nonetheless, the couple has not been able to save enough money to care for the needs of their three children and, at the same time, to cover the upkeep of their farm. Among numerous maintenance problems in her farm, Susanna wants to solve the one that is the most urgent now -- she wants to repair the barn for her farm animals. To do this, she needs 800.000 Armenian drams of loan capital, and she also will buy some animal fodder. She thanks beforehand her Kiva lenders, and she anticipates your

One of them is Mrs. Sita, who was selected as their president. The lady standing fifth from right wearing a black sari in the photo is Sita. Sita is 43 years old and is staying with her husband and her three children. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in cultivation for a long time. She got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighborhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. Initially, she started growing only a few vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, and onions but later on, she grew bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumbers, ladyfingers and brinjal (eggplant). She has a very good relationship with her customers as she sells fresh vegetables to her customers. Now she has a new idea to purchase more seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides to enlarge her vegetable cultivation. For this reason, she has requested a loan to purchase land, seeds and fertilizers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1374164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase land, seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Balipatna, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sajani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sulochana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sulochana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pakei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T18:21:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":574727,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La cliente Ana vive en la ciudad de Playas, es una mujer trabajadora que comenz\u00f3 su negocio vendiendo de casa en casa mercader\u00eda como bisuter\u00eda, ropa para mujeres, zapatos etc. Poco a poco mejoro sus ingresos gracias a su desempe\u00f1o de trabajar todos los d\u00edas. \n\nEn la actualidad trabaja desde las 06:00am todos los d\u00edas.

She is married with four children between the ages of 8 years and 18 years, and has two additional dependents who live with her because they are relatives. In 2003, Zainab established her general stock business. She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business every day. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nZainab requires a loan in order to buy more body cream, soap, cigarettes and assorted drinks. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business so she can attract customers and improve her family's standard of living. In the future, Zainab plans to import her goods from a neighboring country. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1374206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy more body cream, soap, cigarettes and assorted drinks.

In order to provide an income for her family, Cholpongul raises livestock and grows crops - beans, peppers, potatoes, starting with the purchase of one cow.  Thanks to her stubborn labor, Cholpongul currently has one cow with offspring, a horse, and 1.85 hectares of leased land. The sale of milk and dairy products provides her with an income of about 5000 somons per month.  In order to further grow her business, Cholpongul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" to ask for a loan of 60,000 somons in order to increase the amount of livestock by purchasing a cash cow and fertilizer for the land.

This is 27-year-old Trueman from Masvingo (his hand is raised). He is married and has three children.  Trueman runs a manufacturing business producing maputi. The business has been in operation for 10 years. He says the main challenge he faces is that of high transport costs of ferrying maize from Chipinge and Chivhu to Save.

","en":"Badriddin is a joyful 34-year-old man. He is married but does not yet have children. He and his wife live in a small house in a rural village. Not having had children yet, they have not lost heart, but continue to hope and wait. In order to have a steady income, Badriddin engages in his business. For more than 3 years, he and his wife have been growing potatoes. Badriddin himself was born into a farming family, and, because of this, he has great experience in this business, since he has been helping his father work the field from childhood. Each year during the season, he receives a good harvest, which he then sells at the market and receives a stable income.  Badriddin uses the income from his business to spend on food and necessities for his family. However, he wants to bring his home to a better condition, and he needs money in order to do this. So, he has been dreaming of becoming a bigger-scale farmer and wants to expand his business and increase the size of his harvest. Increasing the size of his harvest will give him a larger profit, which will help him save up enough money to remodel his home.  For this reason, Badriddin turned to Avrand and hopes to receive a loan in order to buy potato seeds.  He hopes to have a positive outcome and thanks Avrand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1371857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T01:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T01:10:14Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#PowerfulStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Badriddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":297},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":303}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144285}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T13:55:32Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":573927,"name":"Waros Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Zimbabwe!

She is married to Augusto, who has a job and is the father of their 2 children ages 3 and 2. Together, they live comfortably in their own home. Maudy sells regional food dishes, which is why she will set up a stall in front of her house where she happily attends to her customers. These are primarily neighbors and passers-by of the area. She is restarting this business since she previously had to leave it due to personal problems. Now she is getting the necessary items such as plates, pots, and other products. She plans to run it on her own.\r\n\r\nShe believes her business is fairly successful because there is a high demand in the area because she is well-known and popular. Her neighbors were the ones who asked her to reopen the business.

Her mother was the one who prompted her to open the store and helped her get the premises where it operates.  The space does not only function as the workshop where she makes the clothing that she designs, but also as a store where it is exhibited.  She applies the separation plan, which is to pay before taking the product home, which her customers like very much, and she also accepts cash.  She purchases from fabric and accessories vendors over a large area since they offer the best prices.  This is how she can adjust her costs to the needs of her customers.  \r\n\r\nCurrently she is requesting her first loan from Kiva with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo so that she can purchase an industrial sewing machine.  This will improve her production times and increase the quality of her products.  Her goal in the future is to have her own brand and consolidate with the best collections, designed by her.  Meanwhile, her greatest challenge is to succeed in substantially increasing sales and increase her production to have savings.

He began working in the fields with his brother when he was 10 years old as it is the tradition that children learn to farm from a very early age and put food on the table and cover other necessities. He currently grows beans and corn and also raises livestock on a small scale. During the summer, he goes to work in Costa Rica, clearing land and cutting coffee and this enables him to get capital to invest in his crops. He hopes to get good produce to sell and to make an income that will enable him to invest and grow his harvest. He needs the loan to buy manure, fertilizers, and seeds to sow beans. His next goal is to sow 3 hectares of beans and pay back his loan. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1375452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy manure, fertilizers, and seed to sow beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T02:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T02:10:08Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin Antonio \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":389.7,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":194.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":194.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":389.7,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901555}],"funded_date":"2013-07-07T08:49:20Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:52:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":573957,"name":"Aidah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aidah is a widow hailing from Lugazi, in the Mbarara municipality.

She is a very friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic person who puts all her efforts into moving her family ahead as she is both father and mother to her children. Unfortunately, because of a lack of economic resources and because she had to work from a young age, Nilda was not able to study a professional degree. In her free time she likes to watch movies and sometimes to cook a delicious shrimp chowder called Chupe de Camarones to share with her family. \r\nOn her own initiative, and with much effort and dedication, Nilda runs a small clothes store selling underwear such as briefs, panties, stockings, and other things. Nilda works every day for about 10 hours and believes that she is doing well because of her good prices and for the friendly attention that she gives to others. \r\nNilda is very grateful to the Kiva lenders as, thanks to the help they have offered, she will be able to make improvements to her home as she needs to buy construction materials to repair the roof and to enclose the yard. In this way, she and her family will have more security and wellbeing and she will continue working and striving to achieve her great dream of seeing her little ones become good professionals.

lo que pudo educarse hasta terminar la escuela primaria y luego ayudar en los quehaceres del hogar y del campo junto  a sus padres. Se cas\u00f3 muy joven con Efren  que actualmente tiene 57 a\u00f1os y se dedica a la agricultura, con \u00e9l sali\u00f3 de la ciudad en la que creci\u00f3; para ir a una zona con clima c\u00e1lido donde nacieron sus 6 hijos; 5 de los cuales son independientes, trabajan y tienen su familia, el hijo menor est\u00e1 a punto de terminar la escuela primaria y Rosa vive con \u00e9l y su esposo en R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una ciudad que cuenta un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Sus varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros y la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nRosa con el objetivo de aportar en los gastos del hogar, desde hace 7 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con el negocio de crianza de pollos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, actividad que la aprendi\u00f3 de uno de sus parientes quien comparti\u00f3 todos los conocimientos del negocio para que Rosa tambi\u00e9n lo pusiera en pr\u00e1ctica. Rosa invierte todas las ma\u00f1anas en el aseo, alimentaci\u00f3n y cuidado de los pollos y a veces alg\u00fan tiempo en las tardes, paralelamente a esto, ella realiza los quehaceres del hogar para no despreocuparse de las necesidades de su esposo e hijo. Rosa firma que para este negocio siempre es necesario proveerse de capital para comprar \u201cbalanceado\u201d que es el alimento especial que se da a las aves y adem\u00e1s para comprar pollos beb\u00e9 para criarlos y luego venderlos; es por esto que por cuarto a\u00f1o consecutivo, ella ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de algunos pollos adicionales y adem\u00e1s balanceado al por mayor para tener la provisi\u00f3n de alimento necesaria para los pollos que tiene y los que vendr\u00e1n. Rosa ha sido una cliente puntual en sus cuotas y ha continuado trabajando con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa porque el trato que recibe en la oficina y de su ejecutivo de cuenta es motivador. Rosa agradece  a todas las personas alrededor dl mundo que a\u00fan sin conocerla deciden confiar en ella y su microempresa. ","en":"Rosa is 61 years old.  She grew up in a household with limited resources, so she was only able to attend school through primary school and later helped her parents with the household chores and in the fields.  She got married very young to Efren, who is 57 years old and works as a farmer.  With him, she left the city where she was born to go to an area with a warm climate where their six children were born.  Five of them are now independent and have their own families and the youngest is about to finish primary school.  Rosa lives with him and her husband in Rio Verde in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province.  The city has a significant amount of trade since it has become a land port for exchange between the mountain and coastal regions of the country.  Its various tourist attractions, in addition to its warm climate, are frequented by national and international tourists.  The majority of the inhabitants have learned a commercial trade or provide services to the locals and tourists.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago, with the objective of helping with the household expenses, Rosa started a business raising chickens for later sale.  She learned this work from one of her relatives who shared their knowledge of the business so that Rosa could also put it into practice.  Rosa spends her mornings and sometimes afternoons cleaning, feeding, and caring for the chickens.  At the same time, she does the household chores so that she does not have to worry about the needs of her husband and son.  \r\n\r\nRosa says that for her business it is always necessary to have capital to purchase \"balanceado\", which is the special feed that is given to poultry, as well as chicks to raise them and later sell.  This is why for the fourth consecutive year, she has requested a loan to invest in the purchase of additional chickens and feed at wholesale prices.  This allows her to have the necessary feed for the chickens she has and those she will sell.  \r\n\r\nRosa has been a punctual customer with her repayments and has continued working with Fundacion Alternative because of the treatment she receives in the office and her account manager is motivating.  Rosa is grateful to all of the people around the world who decided to trust her and her small business without knowing her.

","en":"Zulfunun is a 36 year old woman. She is a married mother of three beautiful children. Zulfunun was born and grew up in the countryside. She is a cheerful person, who is hardworking, and has many friends. Zulfunun is the kind of person who lends a helping hand. Her hobby is growing flowers. In 2007 Zulfunun began her business. She began to trade perfume. Despite the fact that all of her time was spent at the market, she tries to do housework. Zulfunun's husband is the head of the household. Her husband's work is seasonal and Zulfunun tries to help him every way she can. Zulfunun has been trading for six years already and knows the market economy well. Zulfunun studies what the market is looking for and what is in demand. After analyzing potential income she changes what she trades. At this time Zulfunun sells women's clothing.

He has six siblings, who work and help their parents. Flaminio has been a mechanic for 18 years, saying that he has helped out since he was little. Today he already has a motorcycle repair shop in his parents' home, and he feels very proud of his achievements.

The group members have small-scale businesses selling juice drinks made from hibiscus flowers or ginger, as well as selling condiments (Magie bouillon cubes, garlic, 'soumbala', \u2026) With the goal of increasing their working capital, the group members decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their first solidarity loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMs. Sitan, who is the woman sitting at the far left in the photo, is a major vendor of local juice drinks. She intends to use her loan to purchase a bag of sugar, 100 kg of ginger, 100 kg of hibiscus flowers, and some flavorings. She gets her supplies at the big market in Bamako. \r\n\r\nTo make juice drinks, the ginger is crushed and soaked in water and allowed to settle, and then sugar, flavorings, and water are added. This mixture is apportioned among drums or plastic pouches ready for sale. Sales are made in cash at the market to a customer base composed mostly of women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to make an average monthly profit of 25,000 francs CFA that will be used for reinvesting in business and providing for her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1375720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase the ingredients for making juice drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Djalakorodji","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayama            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marama         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":151383.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819726},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":151383.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678674},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151383.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924285},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":151383.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207474}],"funded_date":"2013-06-24T16:37:59Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":574957,"name":"Mashauri Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Mihako est leader du groupe de cr\u00e9dit \u00ab Mashauri \u00bb, entrepreneur courageuse et exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 44 ans et m\u00e8re de 10 enfants.

She began this business with funds received from her husband. Later, she was granted credit from the Hekima MFI, and has been performing this activity for the past nine years. Insecurity is an issue for her business activity.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy six bales of worn shoes. In the future, she wants to build a home and further her children's education.

She was born and grew up in Kanibadam. She got married early, and she has two children, but after giving birth to the second one her husband left them for another woman. Firuza was very lonely and she decided to go to her parent's house. But she was not happy there either, as her mother died long time ago and her father is very old, and living together with him was hard. Firuza's brother lives with his own family, and they also barely survive and he is not able to help his sister. \r\n\r\nFiruza decided to earn money for living herself and with the last money she had she bought a goby, She started to take care of it and when he grew some, she sold him at a good price and bought two small calves. This way she started growing her business. Now she has been breeding cattle for more than two years. She already has more than five heads of cattle due to this. \r\n\r\nFiruza is very happy with her business as it gives her a good income. After having saved money, she plans to purchase her own house in the future, and live with her children, not dependent on anyone. Currently Firuza would like to purchase more cattle, but she needs financial means. At the advice of an acquaintance, she decided to submit an application for a loan and turned to the organization \"Arvand\". She hopes very much for financial support.\r\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1372879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Actualmente vive con sus 2 hijos en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nGracias al consejo de una amiga, Esnilda emprendi\u00f3 con la compra \u2013 venta de libros nuevos y usados que los distribuye en las zonas rurales donde hay escasez de librer\u00edas que fomenten la cultura y educaci\u00f3n de los ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes. Esnilda trabaja todos los d\u00edas en un horario de 8 horas y lo hace recorriendo las calles de su ciudad comprando los libros que las personas de la ciudad ya no usan pero que podr\u00edan utilizarlos en otros lugares, tambi\u00e9n va a los almacenes que le proveen de libros nuevos que le piden sus clientes de las zonas que visita. Es un trabajo que le gusta mucho realizar pues ella tambi\u00e9n hace uso de los libros para aprender cosas nuevas. En la actualidad y por el mejoramiento de la educaci\u00f3n que se est\u00e1 dando en todas las zonas, hay una demanda considerable de libros de motivaci\u00f3n y liderazgo por lo que Esnilda requiere un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de estos libros para llevar a sus clientes que los solicitan y tambi\u00e9n motivar a todos sus clientes a leer este tipo de libros que pueden ser de mucha ayuda. Con este incremento en la variedad de sus productos, Esnilda est\u00e1 segura que obtendr\u00e1 utilidades adicionales adem\u00e1s de la satisfacci\u00f3n de poder ayudar a las personas a tener un crecimiento personal asegurado. \nEsnilda sue\u00f1a con poder proveer a sus hijos siempre una educaci\u00f3n de calidad hasta verlos convertidos en profesionales de excelencia y que sean un aporte positivo para el pa\u00eds. Ha realizado un par de cr\u00e9ditos anteriormente y sus cuotas siempre han sido puntuales adem\u00e1s que ha asistido a una de las capacitaciones que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa ha prestado a sus clientes y le pareci\u00f3 muy valioso para ponerlo en pr\u00e1ctica. Gracias a esta Fundaci\u00f3n, Esnilda ha podido capitalizar su negocio y ha recibido de ellos un trato agradable que no  encontr\u00f3 en otras instituciones financieras. ","en":"Esnilda, a woman of 44 years, is a courageous single mother who assumed the responsibility of educating her children and getting them ahead in life. They are now finishing with primary school and preparing for secondary school, in spite of the fact that Esnilda only received a primary education. She has always been willing to work and provide for her family.\r\n\r\nShe currently lives with her two children in the R\u00edo Verde Parrish of Santo Domingo. Santo Domingo is the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a province of Ecuador which has sustained high growth over the past number of years. The most attractive and interesting feature of Santo Domingo city is its delicious fruit and the local gastronomy. The level of business carried out here is also considerable as it has become an inland hub for commercial activity between the country\u2019s mountain and coastal regions. Furthermore, its many tourist attractions and warm climate make it a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists. For this reason, most of the city\u2019s inhabitants are involved in some form of commercial activity or service for local residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nThanks to the advice of a friend, Esnilda began buying and selling new and used books that she distributes in rural areas where there is a scarcity of book stores that might encourage culture and the education of children and young people. Esnilda works 8 hours every day, going through the streets of her city buying books that the people of the city don\u2019t want anymore, but that could be used in other places. She also visits warehouses to get books that her customers have requested. She enjoys the work a lot and also uses the books to learn new things. \r\n\r\nCurrently there is considerable demand for motivational and leadership books to improve the education that is being given in all the areas. Esnilda needs a loan to purchase these books to bring out to the customers that have requested them, and also to motivate all her customers to read this genre of books that can be very helpful. With the increase in variety of books, Esnilda is certain that she will enjoy additional profits as well as the satisfaction of helping her customers grow personally. \r\n\r\nEsnilda\u2019s dream is to provide her children with a good education until she can see them become excellent professionals and positive members of the country. \r\n\r\nShe has taken out a couple of loans before and her payments have always been on time. She has also attended one of the trainings that the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa puts on for its customers. She has been very brave in putting the training into practice. Thanks to the foundation, Esnilda has not only been able to capitalize her business, but has also enjoyed good treatment by the foundation, something she has not encountered in other financial institutions.
