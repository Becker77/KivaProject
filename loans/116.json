They have lived in their own home for the past 30 years.  For the past 25 years Dunia has worked in the craft business.  She makes masks out of plaster molds that she fills with sweet dough.  These are in the shape of babies known locally as \u201cTantawawas\u201d o \u201cpanes D. beb\u00e9\u201d (baby breads).  These are normally sold in the month of November during time of \u201cTodos los Santos\u201d (All Saints), when people go to cemeteries to visit the graves of their friends and family.  Dunia makes them year round since she receives orders from many places.  She really likes her job and she works together with her husband.  Sometimes her niece helps paint the masks because it is a lot of painting.  Unfortunately, due to the fragility of the masks, some of them break during the process and that is a loss in Dunia\u2019s production.

Francisco has a business providing taxi service.  He started this business 13 years ago, as he had the need to look for a means through which he could support his family. He began with a very small clientele, and little by little it has increased because each passenger gave him their telephone number, and so his business became much more efficient.   This loan will be invested in the purchase of spare parts for his automobile.  His dream with respect to the business is to improve every day as a person, and also to have another taxi. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":429944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T23:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63.27,"local_amount":1309.07,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1310.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681449},{"amount":57.56,"local_amount":1190.93,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1192.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075977},{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911985},{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130493334},{"amount":60.41,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676102},{"amount":88.77,"local_amount":1836.62,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1839.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710472},{"amount":70.09,"local_amount":1450.2,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045778},{"amount":61.79,"local_amount":1278.39,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1280.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761002},{"amount":61.29,"local_amount":1267.98,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1269.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848015},{"amount":61.52,"local_amount":1272.79,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1274.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256006},{"amount":79.46,"local_amount":1644.02,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1646.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802050}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T08:17:16Z","paid_date":"2010-11-18T11:09:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":158589,"name":"Majed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Majed is a 30-year-old married man.

As part of the family plans to improve their living situation, she has been sewing for 4 years, and one of the main problems she has had has been the lack of financing because of her limited economic potential.  With help from the completion of the last work that her husband had, she was able to start her small sewing shop, but now she needs a greater investment of capital to buy raw materials and a sewing machine that will make her work easier and quicker, so she will be able to fulfill her work orders.  Thus she will be able to gain additional clients and increase her income, improving their social condition.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":486574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase raw materials and a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-12T04:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":921.89,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":965.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874645},{"amount":45.94,"local_amount":918.79,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":962.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604504},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":916.98,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":960.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639975},{"amount":45.11,"local_amount":902.24,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":945.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821765},{"amount":46.37,"local_amount":927.41,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":971.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561774},{"amount":40.64,"local_amount":812.69,"processed_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":851.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770696},{"amount":45.35,"local_amount":907.01,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:08Z","rounded_local_amount":950.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204586},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":916.57,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":960.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330294},{"amount":88.82,"local_amount":1776.42,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1861.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465459}],"funded_date":"2010-02-13T09:32:58Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geoffrey and Susan Gall","image":107956}},{"id":179497,"name":"Juanita Damaris","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Juanita Damaris D. es una clienta con 2 a\u00f1os de experiencia con esta instituci\u00f3n, donde se le ha financiado para la compra de ganado.

The official name of this borrowing group is Wilfredo G.'s group.\r\n\r\nWilfredo is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, he owns and operates a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing vehicle repairs to local community members. Wilfredo has been engaged in his business for over 26 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Wilfredo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. As with his previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI which he has successfully repaid, this new loan of 10,000 PHP will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business.

She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and will use her most recent loan to increase the inventory in her store.  In the future, Nirmala plans to continue and increase her grocery business.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

Pandan is surrounded by verdant mountains and blue ocean that sparkles during the daytime.\r\n\r\nAdela has been practicing her knowledge of dealing with different people by operating a sari-sari (variety) store for the past three years. This has been her business and her source of income. The profit she has made has helped her husband a lot to augment the family income. Her previous loan from ASHI supported her business and her husband's farming ventures. Since she was able to repay her previous loan, she is now qualified to apply for another loan of a higher amount to support her business. Now, she plans to utilize this loan and her future loans in the same business until it grows. She wishes that someday she could set up a mini-grocery store in their village where she can provide her customers with convenient purchases.\r\n\r\nAdela's aspiration is that all her children will graduate from college with degrees and have a good life. This is the reason why she wants her business to succeed. Through business success, Adela hopes to build her own dream house. Her loan from Kiva through ASHI is a very important factor that could lead her towards fulfillment of her

Firstly, they require little start-up capital, you can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising chickens is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but that was as deep as time would allow our analysis to go.<p>I imagine that some, if not all, of these factors encouraged Mboni M. to establish her kuku-raising business in 2005. She now requires a loan of $275 to purchase even more kuku and expand her business. Mboni is married to Henry and has one daughter, Erica, who is 4 years-old.<p>SELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women.<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<p>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from the said client, extending a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":96679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional chickens to raise and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2007-12-13T00:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mboni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-27T02:35:43Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-01-27T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123005},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-02-27T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":143475},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-03-27T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167541},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-04-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":193393},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-05-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:14Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221234},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-06-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250459},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-07-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279065},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-08-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308616},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-11T07:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339755},{"amount":45.08,"local_amount":49181.81,"processed_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52612.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347267},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":26743.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9969887}],"funded_date":"2007-12-13T02:35:43Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":31387,"name":"Titi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Titi, 43, is the mother of 3 children and sells crispy snacks door-to-door earning about US$ 7 a day.

She lives with her mother, whom she loves very much. They both work very hard to get ahead in life. Ruth\u2019s snack shop is located in one of the city of Juliaca\u2019s most important public transportation stations. Her business is much frequented because the drivers always stop by to eat something in between every trip. Her stand is where the majority of passengers purchase something to eat for the road. What Ruth most likes about her job is attending to her customers and conversing with them. She has been in business for 5 years. What she thinks is the most difficult aspect of her job is having to stay in her kiosk all day long, without being able to take a walk around her city. In the future, she would like to have a big grocery store where she can sell her products with greater comfort. <p>\r\nThis is Ruth\u2019s sixth loan with MFP. Just like she did with her previous loans, she intends to make her payments on time because she knows that if she doesn\u2019t, she will cause problems in her communal bank, where she is respected for being so responsible. With this 1,000.00 PEN loan, she will purchase more snacks to restock her kiosk and in so doing offer her customers a greater selection.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":390542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":169.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997545},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":169.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842893},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":169.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842894},{"amount":174.65,"local_amount":499,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":506.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734469}],"funded_date":"2009-09-19T22:02:22Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":142072,"name":"Jojie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"Perseverance and creativity is needed in managing a small business,\" said Jojie.

They live in the city of Cuenca which is renowned for the jewels of its architecture, the four rivers that bathe this beautiful city, and for its delicious gastronomy.  Mrs. Olga M., 27, is a member of the bank.  She lives in greater Cuenca in the Cristo del Consuelo sector.  She is married and the mother of 5 children, who are 10, 8, 7, 5, and 3 years of age.  Her children are students at the V\u00edctor Manuel Albornos school.  Her husband sells chuzos (dishes of grilled meat).  They do not own their home; they rent.  Olga has sold chuzos for the past 12 years from a food stand that she owns in a certain sector of the city.  She relates that she does well, gets along well with the other members of the bank (she is the founding member), and she is in her second loan cycle working with loans from the foundation.  She also tells us that the loans have been helpful for her to succeed at her work.  She will use the new loan that FUNDACI\u00d3N ESPOIR will grant to buy a little vending cart so that her business can expand.  Her greatest wish it to someday have her own house.  Mrs. Mar\u00eda D., 30,  is also a member of the bank and lives in greater Cuenca in the Narancay Alto sector.  She is married and has a 4-month-old son.  Her husband is a carpenter and she lives in her father-in-law\u2019s house.  Mar\u00eda has sold chuzos for the past 2 years and she does well.  She sells her product in her community, gets along well with the other members of the bank, and is in her first loan cycle.  She was motivated to join by a girlfriend who told her about all the benefits of membership.  The financing that FUNDACI\u00d3N ESPOIR  will grant her, will be  invested for the most part in meats and more products for her business and a little for food for her home.  Her goal is to become a seamstress.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Consuelo makes sweatshirts, uniforms, jackets, etc. During the school year, her work increases and she has to hire people in order to fill her clients' orders. \r\n\r\nAs a result of her work, Consuelo was able to help her children with their education and she is now able to help her grandchildren. What she would most like in the future is to be able to own a home where she can have her own sewing workshop because she is currently renting her home. Consuelo would like to specialize in making lingerie. She would use this loan to purchase materials and to make a pending trip.  EDAPROSPO is a big help to her and her fellow members of \"OBRAS\" as they have all prospered in their small businesses and there is a lot of enthusiasm and support between them. \r\n\r\n*Consuelo is pictured standing fourth from the left.

She is now requesting a new loan of 1,500,000 IDR which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her second loan from MUK. Ni Ketut T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.

She\u2019s 52 years old, married and has five children who are no longer in her care because they support themselves.\r\n\r\nMaril\u00fa always helped her husband with household expenses selling groceries at home.  She helped pay for her children\u2019s schooling and they are all now professionals.  She left the business due to economic reasons.  For the last three years since joining the communal bank she decided to start a new business to earn her own income.  This is how she used her the first loan she got to buy lumber.  Her husband helped her to manufacture chairs, stands and tables that she\u2019d sell.  She doubled her profits.  This helped her buy a sewing machine that she used to make dresses that she\u2019d go out to sell.

Located in the traditional fishing village of Yoff, <i>Sant ak Koolut\u00e9<\/i> has long specialized in producing the batiks and other vibrant hand-dyed fabrics that are used to make traditional clothing here in Senegal.  In addition to their main occupation of cloth-dyeing, the members of <i>Sant ak Koolut\u00e9 group<\/i> collaborate in a wide variety of modest income-generating activities, from raising chickens and vegetable gardening to sewing and crafting artisanal dolls.  The funding from this loan will be used to expand the <i>Sant ak Koolut\u00e9<\/i> cloth-dyeing business, including the purchase of a greater variety of blank fabrics and dye colors. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the <i>Sant ak Koolut\u00e9 group<\/i> group's second Kiva loan.  They have recently reimbursed their previous loan in full and have applied for a larger loan to continue to expand their cloth-dyeing business.  Check out this group's <A HREF=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=710\"> previous journal entries<\/A>.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Background:<\/b>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as <i>tontines<\/i>. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the <i>tontines<\/i> provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.

He saved money and bought a swivel chair, clippers, a table and three plain chairs.  He began with a small shop at his house.  After a few months his client base grew so he needed more space and he changed to a bigger shop.  He now has a swivel chair, a fixed chair, two pairs of clippers, two mirrors, five normal chairs and one employee that helps him cut hair.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis dream is to have another shop, tools, and another employee to continue expanding his client base and be better off economically.  He also dreams of having his own house and a family.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe is requesting this loan to buy tools, such as clippers, two mirrors, five plastic chairs, and an apron.  Perhaps in the future he will ask for another loan to buy another swivel chair and more clippers.

She also knows how to store her products for times of shortage.  She works hardest in the field during the time of planting.  Now Zenaida plans to focus on the transport of her products.  After long years of hard work, she has been able to buy a small bus, which has a pending application of authorization for circulation.

She hopes this will increase her income to afford her children's education.  This is her fourth time taking a loan with MFP.  As part of a communal bank, she has always promoted unity to be able to carry out together a harmonious job.  The amount she is requesting will be used to buy sacks that will allow her to pack her harvested crops and to help pay for the application for her vehicle insurance policy, which will be ready in the next few days.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":270931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business by increasing quantity of items and varieties of items in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Abia A.

She is 51 years old and married with 3 adult children. Emerita owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, to the local community. Emerita has been involved in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 36 PHP per month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Emerita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emerita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI, which she used to to purchase additional products to sell. Emerita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which she will invest in expanding the business. This loan will be Emerita's 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to poor households in Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in her own home with her husband and 4 children. For 30 years she has sold china and general clothing based on the season. She tries to increase and diversify her products. She is constantly working, buying and selling, in her informal sales stall which she is constantly moving, since she does not have a fixed location. Her oldest daughter helps her with this work. When they can't work, they go shopping. With the passing of time, she has become familiar with her sales points. She has very good prices, and so she has more customers. For Maria it is important to continue with her business and get a fixed sales location where she can do her work with more peace of mind. This is her seventh loan with MFP, and she promises again to be responsible with the payment of her quotas. She thinks this loan will be very useful in the progress of her business. With the requested loan, she will invest in the purchase of more lingerie and casual clothing for the weather of the new year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":680167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more lingerie and casual clothing to fill her customers' orders.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-28T16:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":147.84},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":154.72},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":165.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":168.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":178.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":184.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.44},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.02},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.29},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.97},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.44,"local_amount":147.84,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":155.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463703},{"amount":58.02,"local_amount":154.72,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":162.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887086},{"amount":61.92,"local_amount":165.12,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":173.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327447},{"amount":63.29,"local_amount":168.78,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":177.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195994},{"amount":66.97,"local_amount":178.57,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":187.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269678},{"amount":69.36,"local_amount":184.97,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":194.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549680}],"funded_date":"2010-12-28T20:01:47Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":265799,"name":"Jacqueline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacqueline is 32 years old.

People visit the region because of its tropical climate, its fields of flowers, and the wide variety of fruit grown there.\r\nThe Community Bank is made up of fourteen members. They are all very friendly and lively, get on well together, and are good neighbours. They work at different jobs, some in their homes and some out in the community. Here are some examples:\r\nGloria lives in La Estancia, a community located just a few minutes outside of Paute. She is 29 years old, married, and lives with her husband. They have a good marriage and get on well together. They have three children, aged 10, 9, and 8, who attend the local school. They don\u2019t own their own home so they live in a part of the house owned by her parents. Her husband works as a driver and is a mainstay of the household.\r\nGloria is a businesswoman selling clothing from her own stall in the San Jos\u00e9 de Paute market and from her home too. She\u2019s had this business for four years and works from 9am to 5pm every day of the week. As she serves customers from her home too, she works in the evenings or whenever her customers arrive to buy items. She carries a wide variety of clothing for men, women and children.\r\nThis is her second loan and her business has benefited greatly from the money. She says that all is going well with the members both within the bank and within the community. The loan she is asking for today will be used to buy more clothes such as sweaters and jackets which she sells from her market stall. In order to get a greater variety of clothing, Gloria travels to Cuenca to buy at the Feria Libre. In the future she would like to build a house and expand her business.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda lives in La Estancia which is located a few minutes outside the canton of Paute. She is 39 years old and has been a widow for 17 years. She has never remarried. She has three children aged 16, 9, and 5. Her oldest son is in the fourth year of secondary school. The second is in fifth grade of primary school, and the third is in the local kindergarten. The children are not recognised by their father, and they have kept their mother\u2019s last name.  They do have a house of their own but it is in poor condition and on the point of falling down.  They live in another house which they take care of.\r\nMar\u00eda works as a farmer growing all sorts of vegetables. She also raises guinea pigs and chickens. She works from 8am to 5pm every day as she has to water her crops, cut grass for the guinea pigs, or care for the chickens. This is her second loan and all is going well with her colleagues at the bank. She is one of the most lively and entertaining members of the group. This loan will be used to expand the guinea pig and chicken farm. In the future her goal is to have a nice home where she can live proudly.\r\n\r\nZoila lives in the parish of El Cabo, in the neighbourhood of La Estancia. She is 29 years old and has lived with her partner for many years. He helps a great deal in the home. They have a daughter aged 12 who is in first year of high school. They do not own their own home but live in another house which they take care of. Zoila earns her living by raising animals such as guinea pigs, chickens, and pigs. She also grows vegetables which she sells in the Paute and Gualaceo markets.\r\nZoila has worked for herself for the last six months and has had no problem raising the animals. She says that working independently has many advantages, as she doesn\u2019t neglect her domestic duties, or her husband, and she has more time to spend with her daughter. \r\nThis is her third loan with Kiva partner, Fundacion Espoir, and Zoila is very grateful as she has learned to cope by herself and become an independent businesswoman. She plans to use this loan to expand her farm, buy food for the animals and seeds for her vegetable garden.\r\nHer dream is to continue working so that she can give her daughter a good education and never want for anything.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

She sells bread and soft drinks from a store established in her house.  Do\u00f1a Sabina needs a loan to invest in her convenience store and purchase handmade bread in C\u00f3rdoba (located two hours away).  Bread is not available in her community, but there different types of bread sold in C\u00f3rdoba.  Her customers are residents of her own community, so they will buy just about anything she orders.  Sabina tells us that almost everything she brings back from C\u00f3rdoba is sold.  She has been in business for 10 years and is requesting this loan to keep it growing by obtaining a location separate from her house.  In addition, she will purchase more products.  Sabina also works on her farm when necessary, but she hopes in the future she can focus solely on her business since it requires less effort.\r\n<p>\r\nThe other 10 members are:\r\n<p>\r\nDelfina V.

He is 32 years old. Gildo is the group leader of a 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGildo is single. To make a living, Gildo owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Gildo has been engaged in his business for over a year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gildo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gildo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Gildo is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Eugenia y su pareja son el pilar de su familia, desde muy ni\u00f1a sus padres le ense\u00f1aron a trabajar en la chacra, posee su propia parcela de 15 hect\u00e1reas en donde cultiva cacao, pl\u00e1tano y man\u00ed. Han transcurrido 23 a\u00f1os trabajando en esta actividad y considera que le gusta recolectar los frutos; pues de esa manera recibe la recompensa gracias al esfuerzo que dio a sus plantas, sin embargo lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos desde la chacra hasta los centros de acopio de la ciudad de san francisco, lugar donde le ofrecen mejores precios por su cosecha. \nDurante la temporada de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de sus hijos, adem\u00e1s de los jornaleros que contrata, para as\u00ed poder recolectar en menor tiempo sus productos. Por otro lado, Eugenia menciona que hay momentos que no tiene suficiente capital para invertir en su trabajo y pagar a los jornaleros por adelantado para que le ayuden en esta actividad que demanda mucho esfuerzo, es por ello que acude a los pr\u00e9stamos que facilita la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Pero ahora lo que m\u00e1s prioriza es sembrar m\u00e1s plantaciones de cacao porque cuenta con espacio suficiente en su parcela. Este es su 12avo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, siempre ha sido muy puntual en sus pagos y espera serlo ahora tambi\u00e9n. En su banco comunal es una socia responsable, motivo por el cual es muy querida. Con los 2,000 nuevos soles, contratar\u00e1 jornaleros para que le brinden el apoyo en la recolecci\u00f3n de frutos.\n\n","en":"Eugenia is 50 years old and a native of Kimbiri.  She is married to 57 year old Pedro and they live together in their own home in the Villa Quintiarina settlement of the Kimbiri district, along with their five children.\r\n\r\nEugenia and her husband are the pillars of their family.  Her parents taught her how to work the land when she was a little girl and now she has 15 hectares of her own, where she raises cacao, banana, and peanuts.  She\u2019s been doing this for 23 years and enjoys collecting the fruits of her labor.  In this way she receives the reward, thanks to the effort she puts into her crops.  Never the less, the most difficult part is transporting her products to their point of sale in the city of San Francisco, where she can sell her harvest for better prices.\r\n\r\nDuring the harvest season, she\u2019s able to get some help from her children, and also hires field hands, in order to be able to collect the crops quicker.  She also tells us that there are times when she doesn\u2019t have enough capital to invest into her work and pay the field hands in advance, so that they will help with this hard work.  This is why she has seen fit to request this loan though MFP.\r\n\r\nAt this time her biggest priority is to plant her cacao crops, because she has enough space in her fields.  This will be her 12th loan through MFP and she has always been on time with her payments.  She expects to be on time this time as well.  The will use the 2,000 PEN from this loan to hire field hands to help her collect her fruits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":760286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire field hands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-30T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2049.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385296}],"funded_date":"2011-04-30T20:11:50Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She is a farmer who owns 1.5-hectares (3.75-acres) of land on which she cultivates rice to support her family living. Her husband, Mr. Saroeun Chhon, is a palm juice collector.\r\n\r\nIn the rice field, this family has a problem because their rice field has infertile soil.

Azagra, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by buying and selling rice.  Her husband, Rico, who is 52 years old, works as a laborer to earn a living.  They have five children, who are between the ages of 18 and 30 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nLucena joined Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of 16 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her own hard work, Lucena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her last loan in the amount of 10,000 PHP enabled her to earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, which helped to improve her family's standard of living.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is seeking to borrow 10,000 PHP ($225), which she intends to use to purchase additional fertilizer and rice. In turn, she hopes to continue to save up so that she can purchase a tricycle and perform home repairs. Lucena A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, NWTF is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").  Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 per day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.  They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, which is a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

With the loan he\u2019ll purchase the spare parts for his microbus. With your support, Amin will continue to progress. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He tries to conduct his business to provide a minimum hassle experience. Sergey has a talent for making every customer feel valued and appreciated, even after the sales process is complete.

First of all, he is planning to do some electrical improvements to his vending facility. Secondly, he would like to get a better supply of spare parts to sell, such as radiators, crankshafts, generators and starters for different types of vehicles.

Joining TYM, she made the first loan of 1,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to invest in retailing, whose revenue was about 500,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. For 5 years of hard-working and constant studying, she and her husband have become experienced and used the loan more effectively. At the moment, they are buying poultries from local farms and selling them to restaurants, or local customers. This business brings in 2,000,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. Besides, they also raise pigs and chickens at home, so the family\u2019s income is increasing securely. They plan to borrow 10,000,000 Vietnamese Dong for raising and the

The loan she is requesting from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir will go toward the purchase of fabric, thread, zippers, and all kinds of accessories to decorate dresses. She has three sewing machines, one for embroidering and the other for straight stitch and zigzag. She employs one person who is in charge of gem embroidery for wedding and quincea\u00f1era gowns. One wedding gown is worth 300 dollars, depending on what she has to invest in each one. Blanca's dream is to have a much bigger shop of operations, like purchasing a machine that makes bathing suits, which is something she lacks, in order to provide a better service and attract more customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":428870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fabric, thread, zippers, and all kinds of accessories to decorate the dresses she makes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T04:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Enith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":440,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789471},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679974},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679975},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679976},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074511},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074512},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910507},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910508}],"funded_date":"2009-11-19T06:51:16Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":158671,"name":"Roman","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roman, trabaja como procurador realizando tramites legales de todo tipo.\nVive en la zona de miraflores de la Ciudad de La Paz, en casa alquilada.\nEl cr\u00e9dito ser\u00e1 destinado para educaci\u00f3n (pago de tutor, elaboraci\u00f3n de tesis, tramites en el ministerio de educaci\u00f3n y universidad, para obtener su titulo de abogado)\nEs la primera vez que solicita un cr\u00e9dito en Impro, las ganas de superarse le dan la oportunidad de obtener este cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Roman works as a lawyer doing legal procedures of all kinds.
