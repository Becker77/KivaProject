He sells his produce in the municipality's marketplace.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is the training ground for many of Kenya's Olympic runners. She has 2 children and has been farming for 3 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated that milking her cows is her favorite activity on the her farm. Her biggest challenge is feeding her cow. An animal on the farm has been given the names of Cheboit.\r\n\r\nRuth was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"credit management.\"  During Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, she learned that the organization has agricultural products.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. She said that the loan will help her family by helping her generate profit to pay school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Ruth owns a cow and some poultry, but does not own a pig, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a mosquito net and a TV in her house, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, or a DVD player.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

They are, on average, 49 years old and have, on average, six children each.\r\nThey know one another as they live close together and also all have income generating activities in the Banconi-Farada market.

Its four members are all women belonging to Balangir town of Odisha, India. \r\n\r\nAmong the four members, one of the group members is Padmini. The lady sitting in extreme right raising her hand is Padmini. She is 45 years old and lives with her husband, two sons, two daughters, daughter in-law and two grandchildren. \r\n\r\nPadmini is running a multifarious business with the help of her husband and sons. Her son is running a snacks, sweets, gram, popcorn making\/processing and supply business at her house. He also supplies dry foods like biscuits, chocolate, chips etc., to the traders of the town on a daily basis. Apart from this, he also covers 50 shops outside the town. Her husband takes order of assembling CFL (compact florescent light) bulbs from electrical goods wholesellers. She has also a tailoring machine for stitching ladies' garments. Padmini initially started her business in a low profile with two or three items. With the support from Mahashakti foundation, the business slowly expanded in to many activities. \r\n\r\nHer families spends almost 12 hours a day making snacks and making packets for selling and assembling electrical bulbs. In this process her family earns a monthly profit of 6,000 INR. According to Padmini this amount is not sufficient to manage her business as well as the family expenses. Therefore, she wants to buy a stock of raw materials like cooking oil, sugar, dough and dry food items so that they have enough stock to carry on their business regularly without any intervention and earn some extra profit. So Padmini has planned to use the present loan to buy cooking oil, sugar, dough and dry food items in bulk. Thereby she will save transportation cost and get the cash discount. She hopes to purchase a leaf plate pressing machine in the near future to start another business. She also dreams to construct a house building and provide better education to her grandchildren.\r\n \r\nThe other three members of the group named Tapaswini, Urmila and Jayanti are involved in businesses like wholesale fruits, general grocery shop and milk.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1374427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of cooking oil, sugar, dough and dry food items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tapaswini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urmila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":132000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":132000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T17:52:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":574240,"name":"Tukolerewamu Farmers &traders Grp Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stephen, a single father of five children, is an agriculturalist growing crops on a small farm and also raising pigs, goats, chickens and fish.

The women average 46 years of age and six children each; they all live in the Sabalibougou neighborhood, in Commune V, in the Bamako District. They know one another through ties of community and their revenue-generating businesses at the Sabalibougou market. The group members work in the small-scale commerce of vegetables (eggplant, chili peppers, tomatoes, celery), fresh fish, charcoal, and 'pagnes' (the colorful cloth of western Africa). To increase their working capital the group members decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their first solidarity loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMs. Maimouna (the first woman sitting at the far right) is a major vendor of plastic footwear for all ages and of several models at the Sabalibougou market.

She is divorced, but she lives comfortably in her own house with her last son, age 21.  Enith sells replacement parts for vehicles.  In order to do so, she has a warehouse at her ex-husband\u2019s house.  He is the father of her son, and she maintains a commercial relationship with him.  She gets the tools from another city in order to later sell them to the local shops or directly to customers who have vehicles.  \r\n\r\nShe has been working in this business activity for seven years, and she does so with help from another person.  What she likes about her business activity is the income she gets, which she uses to pay the household expenses.  She also pays the university expenses for her son, whom she loves very much.  Additionally, she has managed to use the income to buy some appliances, and she has been able to make repairs to her house.

He lives in the small village of Sagarejo District with his parents, who are provided with a retirement pension.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNowadays the family does not have a good source of income.  According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGivi requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business.  Givi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

He resides with his wife and their children in a large traditional family in Wayerma I, a working-class district in Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). After having run many businesses without success, Mr. Dramane became familiar with the buying and selling of white damask cloth, caustic soda, dyes, etc. about four years ago. He runs his business in Wayerma I, where he has a shop. He is much in demand by his customers for the quality of his products. \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying his burgeoning customer base, he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.

He and his father would go out to buy pigs in places like El Tiangue at the houses of people who work raising pigs.  Today, he works selling them because his father no longer works due to a broken foot that happened in an accident and now he takes care of his father and his wife by means of the pig sales.  Williams supports his home and buys his father\u2019s medicine too.  He buys the pigs in places far from his house at a distance of about 10 kilometers which makes transporting them difficult.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy more pigs because the price of pigs is good now to generate a higher profit margin because the ones he has now are already sold and he wants to buy more to sell to sell to his customers.  His business has a large turnover and he does not want to disappoint his customers; he needs the money to buy more because the money he has is insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe loan will improve his life because he works selling pigs and the money he earns from the sales, his profits, will be used to buy more pigs and his household income will increase at the same time so he can buy his father\u2019s medicine and improve his wife\u2019s living condition.  In future, he plans to improve the installations where he keeps his pigs and to build his own house.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1376085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T18:20:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Williams Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":61.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":61.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":67.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":68.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":86.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":92.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":94.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":98.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":102.32},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":120.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.69},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":574302,"name":"Zyonnie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zyonnie is a 31-year-old, single woman.

He\u2019s been a livestock merchant for about 10 years and comments that he does very well.  Occasionally when he gets sick he\u2019s unable to go out to work because he lives alone at home because his wife\u2019s abroad.  All of the children he\u2019s had are already married but one of his daughters is always watching over him.\r\n\r\nIn addition to buying and selling animals, he also grows sugarcane.

is 25 years old. She lives in the Khelvachauri District with husband Ucha and 5-year-old son Nikoloz. Irina requested loan from local financial institutions several times for her family business start-up without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nIrina\u2019s husband Ucha is an artisan. He works on house construction and renovations for private orders to earn a small monthly salary, which is the only source of the income for the family. \r\nIrina requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Irina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Irina will open a shoe shop. She has already rented a commercial space in a very populous area and now wants to fill it up with shoes. Irina will work in the shop as a seller herself in order to decrease expenses and increase her income. She will reinvest part of the profit in the same field and purchase more varieties of shoes to satisfy client needs more. Another part of the profit will be used to improve the family's living conditions and insure a better life for her son.

He lives in Marneuli district, with his 48-year-old wife and 27-year-old son. Sakhib requested loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nSakhib has a car, and he drives it as a taxi, transporting local people. His wife is a tailor, working on private orders. They both earn small monthly salaries, which is rarely enough to cover their food expenses.\r\n \r\nSakhib requested a loan from Credo to start-up family business. Sakhib has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit Sakhib will start a business, trading in shoes.

She will use the 1,500 soles to buy meat and other ingredients to prepare the dishes.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1374411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy meat and other ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Bellavista","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":159.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":170.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":182.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":192.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":198.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":209.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":219.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.42,"local_amount":159.32,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":160.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997222},{"amount":61.17,"local_amount":166.84,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864689},{"amount":62.68,"local_amount":170.94,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":171.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353059},{"amount":67.02,"local_amount":182.78,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:00:24Z","rounded_local_amount":183.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904822},{"amount":70.67,"local_amount":192.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":193.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090829},{"amount":72.78,"local_amount":198.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":199.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777440},{"amount":76.95,"local_amount":209.87,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":211.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450597988},{"amount":80.31,"local_amount":219.02,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-03T09:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":220.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147312}],"funded_date":"2013-06-29T16:24:04Z","paid_date":"2014-07-03T09:49:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":575101,"name":"Sigibekolasa Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"SIGIBEKOLASA est un regroupement de 7 hommes mari\u00e9s ayant en moyenne 33  ans, 4 enfants et vivant  dans des familles traditionnelles dans le village de Farala, un des villages de la commune urbaine de Bougouni (3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali). \nIls sont \u00e0 leur quatri\u00e8me collaboration avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso.

following this saying,\" giggled Nengjadim. She is one of the members with \u201cLily\u201d Group. She is pictured with her hand raised, and she is the featured borrower member for the group. She is hardworking and determined in whatever she does. Both she and her husband earn for the family, and her husband is a daily wage-earner. \n\nThe group members were all inspired through the teamwork and collaboration shown through \"Nisopah Group\". They are active members with WSDS, and the secretary of the group conveyed the benefits of the formation of Self-Help groups to \"Lily Group\". \n\nNengjadim raises livestock like cows, sheep and buffaloes.  She generates income after selling the milk that the cow produces and also makes money by offering the buffaloes for farming purposes on a hiring basis during the ploughing seasons. She makes good money because modern farming machines are unaffordable for the village cultivators. She also raises sheep and sells them when they are fully grown. \n\nShe makes a good income, but it is completely unreliable. The source of income for Nengjadim and her husband entirely depends on seasons because during off-seasons the income is tight. Managing the household expenses and running the family without a regular income is complicated for Nengjadim. Her main trade is selling sheep in the neighbouring villages. Buyers come to her house to purchase the sheep and she also takes them to the local market and sells them at a good price.\n\nWith the Kiva loan, she will construct a better and spacious barn for the sheep. She is raising more than twenty sheep at present.  She is glad that Kiva is supporting her for the barn construction, and she plans to own a minivan within ten years. The minivan will be used as a public transport between the village and the capital city. \n\nShe will open a savings account and start saving to make her plans come true. She says even if she and her husband fail to purchase the minivan within ten years, she will purchase an auto rickshaw instead.

As a source of income for her family, Gulgaaky works with livestock breeding and sale of milk, after having started this business 10 years ago with the purchase of two calves. She has developed this to 15 sheep and goats, one cow with offspring and 0.40 hectares of irrigated land with beans and beets. Further, being an active person, Gulgaaky founded a business of sewing national clothing and repairing clothes. Her husband helps her with marketing the products. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulgaaky turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of two bulls. Gulgaaky plans to invest the income from the loan in increasing the number of livestock, in order to pay for her son's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1376116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase bull-calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Pokrovka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T19:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T19:20:05Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulgaaky","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":15133.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743798},{"amount":937.5,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":45401.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426914}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T15:00:48Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:17:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":574375,"name":"Rukhsana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A loan of 25,000 PKR would help Rukhsana to get a new sewing machine for her daughter, so that she could help Rukhsana in her work.

He hails from rural Rugarama in Ntungamo District. He is married to Marion. They have two children. Balam is a motorcycle rider in the rural area.  Since there is no easy means of transport, he has many people hiring him to bring them to different areas.

Her children are between the ages of 20 and 4. Only three are currently living at home and only two are in school.  \r\nRuth owns her own small local shop business selling rice, cube, soap, oil, salt, etc., for the past 12 years.

She started her business with a small amount of money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by shared taxi. She cites rainy season as her biggest challenge.

She resides in Buchanan, the capital City of Grand Bassa County. The county is located by the sea and is known for its beaches and fish. Many logging companies are also located in the city. People in Buchanan are known in the country for their love of fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Cecelia is 47 and married with three children. Her children are between the ages of 19 and 11. Only one is currently living at home and two are in school.  \r\nCecelia has owned her own table business selling beans, peanuts, pepper, flour, etc. for the past two years.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more beans, peanuts, pepper, flour, etc. for her business.  \r\nOn average, she works 11 hours at her business from Monday to Saturday. She started her business with a small amount of money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by shared taxi. She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is controlling her own money. In the future, she would like to build a modern shop.  \r\nShe is grateful for your

They work growing corn and are a very united family.  She\u2019s a very well-known person in her zone; she\u2019s very kind and respectful to people living thereabouts.  She works selling dairy products she gets from her cows and she sells her corn crop in the local square.  She learned at the age of 20 because her parents sold dairy products too.  They\u2019d come to town and divide it up by zones in order to cover all the houses selling cheese, milk and cream.  This is how she stared out selling milk and she learned to grow corn and beans from her husband.

She and her husband cultivate coffee. They have two children; the eldest is in school and the youngest is too young for school. In their home it is just the four of them: Doris, her two children, and her husband. They are the only people who work their land. They have been cultivating coffee for over 15 years. Their parents taught them to work the land. Agriculture (coffee cultivation) has been their only source of income for many years.

Now, she has requested another loan worth Rs. 40000 to purchase a new machine with more packs of threads and sequins in different colors. She says that the females in her community have become demanding over time and satisfying them is a challenge that Shamsa has taken up. She has four children, two in school. She wishes to provide them quality education for prosperous futures.

pues los recursos de su familia eran limitados y \u00e9l no pudo continuar sus estudios despu\u00e9s de la primaria. Hace algunos a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 unirse con su pareja Gloria que tiene 33 a\u00f1os y es ayudante de cocina en un restaurant, con esta mujer Edgar ha formado un hogar con cuatro hijos preciosos quienes estudian en la escuela p\u00fablica y Edgar espera darles la oportunidad que \u00e9l no tuvo de culminar sus estudios hasta que sean profesionales. Edgar vive con su familia en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nEdgar trabaja independientemente desde hace 4 a\u00f1os en la crianza de cerdos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, empez\u00f3 a trabajar en esta labor para conseguir ingresos adicionales a su trabajo, ahora se dedica m\u00e1s tiempo, sin embargo, es un negocio que est\u00e1 saturado ya que muchos habitantes de la zona se dedican a la venta de animales, pero Edgar tiene clientes que le buscan por el buen cuidado que le da a los animales y los precios justos a los que vende. En una anterior ocasi\u00f3n Edgar form\u00f3 parte de un grupo con el que obtuvieron un cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, en esta ocasi\u00f3n solicita un pr\u00e9stamo de forma independiente que lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de cerdos y tambi\u00e9n pollos para as\u00ed incrementar su negocio y obtener mejores utilidades que le permitan brindar a su familia un mejor estilo de vida. Edgar afirma que la primera vez que trabaj\u00f3 con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa sinti\u00f3 mucha seguridad y se sinti\u00f3 respaldado por la instituci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de la asesor\u00eda de su ejecutivo de cuenta que le ha ayudado mucho con consejos de c\u00f3mo administrar su negocio. ","en":"Edgar, 38, learned to work when he was a child as his family had limited resources and he could not continue his education after primary school. A few years ago he decided to marry his partner Gloria, a 33 year old kitchen assistant. With this woman, Edgar has created a home with four children who are all studying at the public school and Edgar hopes to give them the opportunities that he never had to study until they are professionals. \r\n\r\nEdgar and his family live in the R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo parish, the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. A province of Ecuador that in recent years has sustained a high level of growth. Its capital is a city that names delicious fruits and gastronomy as its most attractive and appealing offerings. It also counts on a considerable commerce as it has become a gateway of commercial exchange between the desert and coastal regions of the country. It also counts on various tourist attractions that along with the warn climate mean it is often frequented by domestic and foreign tourists. It is for this reason that the majority of its residents have set up some kind of commercial activity or service for residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nEdgar has been working independently for 4 years, growing pigs and later selling them. He started working in this trade to earn supplementary income for his work. Now he dedicates more time to it, however, it is a business that is saturated as many residents in the area sell animals for a living. Edgar has customers who look for him as he gives good care to the animals and sells them for a fair price.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Edgar was part of a group that obtained a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, on this occasion he is requesting a loan independently to buy pigs and chickens so that he can grow his business and earn better profits to allow him to give his family a better quality of life. Edgar asserts that the first time he worked with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, he felt much safer and felt supported and by the institution through the consultant in charge of their account who gave him lots of advice on how to run his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1376014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy pigs and chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Eulogio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.3},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":93.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":98.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":99.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":101.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168.41,"local_amount":167.09,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565423},{"amount":86.58,"local_amount":85.9,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814460},{"amount":88.61,"local_amount":87.92,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320634},{"amount":183.01,"local_amount":181.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":183.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059899},{"amount":191.04,"local_amount":189.53,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":191.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413672},{"amount":99.18,"local_amount":98.4,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":99.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102314},{"amount":100.53,"local_amount":99.75,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":100.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212206},{"amount":207.64,"local_amount":206.01,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":207.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138212}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T15:31:04Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:19:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Godwin","image":null}},{"id":574483,"name":"Decontee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Decontee is a 38-year-old businesswoman from Liberia.

Ana\". Most of the women live in Santa Ana, a very small village on the outskirts of Antigua Guatemala. All of their businesses have been verified by business advisors, who believe that each woman stands to benefit from the support offered by Fundacion Namaste Guatemaya.  In addition to a loan, Namaste provides coaching from business advisors who develop a detailed understanding of the borrowers business (see below an example of how much detail they have on their clients).  \n\nEach of the women in this group are hard-working entrepreneurial ladies that dream of growing and bettering their businesses. Most of them are involved in the production and selling of food. For example, one of them promotes her business on Facebook and provides updates on the new products she will sell in the near future. There is also a woman who sells corn meal (the only one in the area) and another who sells products by catalog. \n\nCarmen Lucrecia (2nd from left to right) is a 48 year-old single mom who went to school through 9th grade. She has two daughters, one that is already married who contributes Q400 ($53)  per month to the household income and a younger daughter that still lives with her. Her younger daughter also has a daughter and Carmen Lucrecia pays for her school. Carmen Lucrecia has been selling food at the park of Santa Ana for the last 12 years and has become famous for her garlic bread, a product she introduced long ago to differentiate herself from the competition. She calls her big delicious bread \u201cNeco\u201d and this is the main attraction for her customers.

They all are involved in the buying\/selling or production\/selling of food. In the early educational sessions provided by Fundacion Namaste Guatemaya prior to getting a loan, the group has demonstrated that they are motivated and very interested in learning how to keep control of their expenses and sales. The group also mentioned that previously nobody has taught them how to improve their business. Therefore they are eager to receive Namaste's Business Adviser monthly visit to quantify their business metrics and help improve their profits. \n\nLilian is 40 years old, a widow and is raising two kids who are under 15 years-old and are going to school (in the picture, you can see her 4th from left). Lilian does not know how to read and write and is living far away from her family. While she was living with her husband and raising their family, he suddenly fell ill and ultimately passed from an unknown illness.  They exhausted their savings on medical bills and were forced to sell all of their appliances to pay doctors and hospital bills. Widowed and broke with two kids to raise, Lilian moved to a place where she pays no rent and gets electricity from the owner. She started selling tortillas [corn flatbread] door to door and now she has a place to make them and sell them too. Until now, she has been producing the tortillas for lunch and dinner. \n\nHer dream is to be able to have enough money to buy wood and corn in bulk because it is cheaper and now with the rainy season, dry wood is very difficult to find. With these supplies, she will be able to start producing tortillas for breakfast to meet her clients requests. She wants to learn how to manage her money and separate and save it in a way that she can start purchasing all of the appliances she was forced to sell when her husband got sick. \n\nHer actual monthly profit is Q1,740 (US$228) and she works 170 hours per month (US$1.35 profit per hour). Her business plan is to increase her profit by 40% by adding an additional selling time and by purchasing dry wood and corn in bulk.

She is single and has three children, between the ages of 1 and 10. Only two are currently attending school and they all live at home. Kullah completed grade 7 before starting her business. She describes herself as hard working woman.\r\n\r\nKullah lives and works in Buchanan, the capital City of Grand Bassa County, which is located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, cassava based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nKullah has a table business where she has been selling fresh fish for the past three years.  She works from 8am to 4pm per day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is low income. She intends to use the loan to buy more fresh fish. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because it helps to support her home.  She hopes to one day to own a house.\r\n  \r\nShe wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advanced for their help.

Her husband runs a private taxi service in the city. Saodat has been working in a polyclinic and teaching at the Medical College for more than 33 years. She teaches fifth and sixth year students in the Family Medicine department. She is both an experienced specialist and a responsible employee.  Her children, too, are very bright. Her daughter Hozanin speaks three languages: English, German, and French. Her oldest son is a graduate of a university in Texas.

Before starting her business she worked in a store that sold clothes, accessories and cosmetic jewellery in general. This was an important experience that enabled her, last year, to start her own business offering the same products to earn an independent income to support her son. \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is acquiring sufficient working capital to invest because she sells to her clients on credit and the recovery of her financial investment does not allow her to grow quickly. This is why she is turning to Kiva. This is her first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will buy clothes, accessories and cosmetic jewellery in addition to the orders that her customers have placed. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to continue working hard to get ahead, to have her own premises beside her house so she can tend to her son and to household chores with greater facility, while, at the same time, selling and earning an income to support her son. \r\n\r\nThe success of the investment consists in that she will invest in products that are in demand, and also in that she is very selective with her clients. She will also have the opportunity to increase the volume of her purchases, to obtain competitive prices, which she will pass on to her customers to keep them interested in buying. This way she will continue earning an income to support

She has an optimistic spirit and above all is humble.  She is the mother of 9, who she has brought up alone since the father of her children abandoned her and she became father and mother to the kids.  Her home is located in the city of Nazca, which is known for having a very warm climate. In addition, the town of Nazca is known for its \"Lines of Nazca\" which are hieroglyphics that can be found in the middle of a large arid field and that, according to experts, were used as an astronomical calendar employed to determine when the rainy season would arrive.  When Teofila has free time she likes to watch television, especially Latin American soap operas (telenovelas).  She also likes to prepare one of her favorite dishes for her family, which is the delicious \"Frijoles con Carne\" or \"Beef and Beans.\"  Due to the limited economic resources of her parents, she was only able to complete primary school, but she would very much have liked to finish high school.\r\n\r\nWith much dedication Teofila works in her business as a farmer. She has a parcel of \"tuna,\" which is a fruit that grows on a species of cactus and is very delicious. Also on those same plants there is the \"cochinilla\" which is a small insect that is used for making diverse weaving fabrics, as well as to give color to foods.  She works around 7 hours daily, since she always has to check her crops. She believes that things are going well for her because she is very dedicated.\r\n\r\nTeofila is very thankful for the Kiva lenders since this is the second time that they have offered their valuable help and thanks to the help given, and more than anything thanks to the trust shown, she will be able to care for her crop which includes providing fertilizers, irrigation, weeding, among other things.
