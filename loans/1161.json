She has four children and has been doing this work for fifteen years. Her primary sources of income are milk, eggs and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming as 'rearing poultry.'  Her biggest challenge is 'access to agricultural finance.'  Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Lelgina.'\r\n\r\nDina was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'I joined Juhudi following the success of other Juhudi members.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, she said 'I learnt how I could boost my production and income from funding from Juhudi.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit her family?' Dina replied 'it will boost my poultry project by increasing production and income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Dina owns the following: a cow and poultry but she does not own 'pigs, pumps, bicycles, motorcycles or automobiles'.  Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'a mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, a TV or a DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1375598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-25T17:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-25T17:10:10Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3594.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3689.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3787.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3887.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3990.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4095.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4204.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4315.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4429.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4546.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4666.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4789.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.14},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.14,"local_amount":3678.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3777.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960600},{"amount":45.31,"local_amount":3775.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3877.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820280},{"amount":46.5,"local_amount":3875.36,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3979.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417368},{"amount":464.05,"local_amount":38670.75,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":39713.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880912}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T23:33:06Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane  Slocombe","image":null}},{"id":574860,"name":"Librada","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Librada is 45 years old and married with two children.

He intends to get involved in buying and selling cattle.  The livestock market is located near his house; thus, he will not have travel expenses in this business.

Everlyne owns poultry but does not own a cow, pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a mosquito net in the household but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

Only one of her children is currently attending school and they all live with her in her home.   \r\n\r\nRebecca runs a shop selling goods such as fashionable local jewellery. She describes herself as business minded woman. She started her business five years ago, using money from her mother. \r\n\r\nTypically, Rebecca works nine hours per day at her business and transports goods to her business by bus. She cites her greatest challenge as less income. Rebecca is proud of her business because it enables her to support her family.\r\n\r\nUsing the proceeds of this loan, Rebecca intends to purchase more jewellery for her business. In the future, she plans to open another shop and build a house. She sincerely thanks you in advance for your support.

","en":"Davronjon is a good, hardworking person.  He is a master of all trades.  Due to family circumstances and hard times, he was unable to get a degree.  After high school, he worked and helped his parents since he is the oldest son in the family.  He now has a loving wife and three children.  His wife doesn't work outside of the home, but raises the children.  Davronjon is a responsible member of his family, a caring father and kind husband.  He works so his family doesn't want for anything and so that his children grow up literate.  Several years ago, Davronjon opened his own business connected with manufactured gas equipment.  He knows and runs the business well and his work is very much in demand.  He also skillful repairs vehicles.  He serves many clients each day.  He believes that good hard work brings his family happiness because the money earned provides for people closest to him.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"Rearing dairy cows.\" Her biggest challenge is: \"How to boost production due to low milk-producing animals.\" Animals on the farm have been given the names of: \"Lelmok.\"\r\n\r\nHellen was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Joined Juhudi after being convinced by a neighbor.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: \"How microfinance institutions work to boost farmers' income.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit her family?,\" Hellen replied, \"Will purchase a high-yielding dairy cow.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi Kilimo's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Hellen owns the following: 'cow, poultry,' but does not own: 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards, based on this loan. This borrower does not have in the household: 'mosquito net, electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD.'\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1375603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Her children ages are 5 and 3. They are currently living at home and are in school.

She lives sin the town of Dongu, and belongs to a group called El Posito. She says that they called it that because close to her house there is a water well (pozo) that supplies the whole community. She grows avocados, manzano chiles, peaches, and blackberries. She has two enormous plots of land with the fruit trees. She also says that in November and December she sells poinsettias, since one of her daughters grows them. Angelina buys them from her to sell in the state of a M\u00e9xico in different  street markets. Her husband is a beekeeper and on the land where she has her trees he has his apiaries where the bees make their hives and leave their honey. She helps her husband sell the honey. She says the best honey is dark, since the bees get it from the avocado trees. She also sells propolis, royal jelly and wax. She says that she really likes to help her husband care for the bees. Right now Angelina is asking for a loan to buy chemical fertilizer and manure and lime to improve her trees. They have to be in good condition so that her bees, as she says, can also be in good condition. The fruit she gets from the trees goes to the wholesale center in the town of Zitacuaro to sell by the bushel so she makes a little more. Angelina's dream is to have a stable spot in the wholesale center to sell her fruits and vegetables every day in season. She says she is grateful to VisionFund for giving her the chance to improve her orchards. The other members of the group are named Mar\u00eda del Carmen, Miriam, Diana and Jorge. They will invest in materials for their avocado, peach and blackberry orchards and in a small grocery store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1376269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy manure and chemical fertilizer and insecticide to grow avocados and peaches.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-06-25T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-25T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":545,"local_amount":7200,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":7262.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840208},{"amount":272.5,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3631.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698642},{"amount":272.5,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3631.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698643},{"amount":545,"local_amount":7200,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":7262.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944836},{"amount":272.5,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3631.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227910},{"amount":817.5,"local_amount":10800,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10893.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991759}],"funded_date":"2013-06-26T01:48:28Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":574902,"name":"Mary Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Joy is 27 years old and single.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

Now I make better profits\u201d.  Gabriela says that she sells to most of her customers on account.  When she sees that people can\u2019t pay cash she helps them in this way.  She says that she is requesting this loan to buy soap, soft drinks, bread, milk, eggs, sugar, coffee, salt, beans, rice, cooking oil, light bulbs, toilet paper, disposable diapers, baby formula and many other products.  She goes to the city of Zitacuaro to buy her products from shops where she can get them much cheaper.  This means that she can sell them more cheaply herself.  She says that one of the reasons she set up her store was so that people from her community didn\u2019t have to spend money on transportation in order to buy the basics they needed to make their meals.  She says that her dream is to invest in fruit and vegetables and some cold cuts but that she needs a larger refrigerator for this so that the produce doesn\u2019t go off.  Gabriela is grateful to the institutions who will make her loan possible.\r\n\r\nAntonio, Edith Ver\u00f3nica, Esperanza, Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, Ma.

She says that she was invited by one of her aunts because the aunt saw that she was unhappy when between herself and her spouse they were unable to get together enough money to buy parts for a minibus used for public transport. For this reason her aunt suggested that she start to work with VisionFund so that they would be able to keep their minibus in better condition. \r\n\r\nShe lives in a town that is known nationally as one of the main producers of poinsettias. She says that seasonally when it is November, her husband goes off to make deliveries of this flower  throughout the country and this is the best time of the year for him because he has daily work. During the rest of the year he occupies himsef by working different routes with the minibus as public transport. Currently Yola, as her friends call her, is looking for a loan in order to purchase spare parts like tires and to perform maintenance on the minibus.\r\n\r\nShe says that the previous loans that she has taken out have helped her a lot because they have improved her family unit. In addition, she is saving to buy another minibus and in this way provide work for the people in her community.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are named Audelia, Le\u00f3nides, Josefina and Candelaria. They will invest their loan in a notions store, to purchase articles to stock a grocery store, to purchase women's and children's clothes to sell and to purchase flowerpots, mortars and crafts to sell.

Levan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Levan will purchase chicks, chicken feed and cages for them.

Two of his children are still in high school but the older two girls dropped out due to lack of school fees and now live with him and their children.  The family depends on their 3-acre piece of land for agriculture and dairy farming to get income for their basic needs.  Morrison, who is the head of the family, has to educate his two children in school as well as help take care of his 3 grandchildren from the little that comes out of his farming business. \n\nThrough hard work, he has bought 3 dairy cows with an earlier Mifugo loan advanced to him by Visionary Empowerment Programme and from these he is able to sell at least 20 liters of milk per day at about 25 US cents, making around $140 per month.  For the last 6 months he has also been using composting to grow vegetables for sale and makes an extra $23.\n\nHowever, a big percentage of this money goes into purchase of fuel which he can save by using renewable energy.  By having a biodigester constructed for him, he can save at least $16 spent every month on charcoal, $35 spent on kerosene, and the drudgery his wife and girls endure while searching for firewood.  With the bioslurry, he can also improve his agriculture by using higher quality manure, hence increasing his crop production and in the end increasing his income.  The increased income and the savings from fuel purchase will enable him repay the loan and have an improved lifestyle for himself and his family.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1377992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

This will make the lamps even more accessible to the clients who will no longer need to pay transport to come collect the lamps from our storage.  From the lamps she will make a profit margin of between $2-35 US and this will enable her repay the loan as well as plough some money back into the business for growth.\n\nBeing a very influential person in the community, she will be able to reach bigger numbers at the bottom of the pyramid as most people have confidence in her.  Demonstrations in the evenings when its dark will also help increase the confidence in the solar lamps which have passed the Lighting Africa standards test of quality.

He lives in the small village of Martvili District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and three grandchildren. Demur has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from their agricultural activities. In particular, they have three pigs, six milking cows and seven calves. They produce dairy products to sell. In addition, they have bee-hives with bee-colonies and a plot of land, where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested nuts and honey at local markets for a good price. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nDemur has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Demur has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan, Demur will open a grocery shop. He will purchase grocery stock and after opening a shop he will work hard to increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

with his 48-year-old wife Madona. Merab has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start a family business. However, he has not had any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has two milk cows and two pigs. The cows are milked every day to produce cheese and sell at the local market for a small income. From the pigs, they sell piglets. The family's total income is 280 GEL. This amount is rarely enough to buy food. \r\n\r\nMerab has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Merab has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business loans with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Merab will purchase chicks and chicken feed. He already has cages in which to place them. Merab is a very hardworking man. He wants to expand his agricultural business and increase the family's income. He will raise the chicks and sell them at a higher price. The increased income will give them an opportunity to have access to a better living. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":1375729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To buy chicks and chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Zeda Simoneti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-26T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-26T09:40:02Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merab ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":135.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":141.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":142.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":145.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":156.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":153.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":159.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":161.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":169.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":173.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":179.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":182.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":188.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":191.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":196.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":203.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":206.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":212.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":217.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.74},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.13,"local_amount":125.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":125.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613788},{"amount":76.08,"local_amount":125.49,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":125.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857500},{"amount":2272.79,"local_amount":3748.94,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3751.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134150}],"funded_date":"2013-07-25T21:33:55Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:15:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":574979,"name":"Trang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Trang was born in 1985.

He lives in Akhaltsikhe District, Minadze Village with his 25-year-old wife, parents, retired grandmother and 3-year-old daughter. Shota has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up without any success. His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThis family has two milk cows, calves and a plot of agricultural land. On the land, potatoes, onions and different types of vegetables are grown. The cows are milked every day to produce dairy products. The harvested products and dairy are sold at the local market so the family can make a small monthly income. Their additional income is from Shota\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly salary and his grandmother\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n\r\nShota requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Shota has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Shota will purchase a minibus. He wants to start trading fruits and vegetables. With the mini-bus, Shota will be able to purchase products at a wholesale price and distribute them among the villagers and at the local markets with a price markup.

When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Joel replied that it will boost the family income.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Joel owns the following: cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1375756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To construct a zero-grazing unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-26T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-26T13:50:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2876.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2952.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3110.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3192.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3276.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3363.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3452.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3543.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3637.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3733.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3831.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":9.83,"local_amount":828.01,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":842.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417371},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":1929.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1962.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880916},{"amount":20.31,"local_amount":1710.72,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1739.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449657934},{"amount":36.35,"local_amount":3060.77,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3113.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343299},{"amount":128.71,"local_amount":10839.08,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":11024.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859489},{"amount":256.89,"local_amount":21632.32,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":22002.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287023}],"funded_date":"2013-07-25T15:56:39Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T14:34:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":575945,"name":"Rosario De La Cruz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Rosario es una microempresaria de \u00e9xito, casada, con dos hijos  su negocio es la venta de ropa nueva, cosm\u00e9ticos de la Avon.

Nickson has a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, TV or DVD player.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and sent the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1375759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-26T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-26T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nickson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4314.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4428.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4665.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4789.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4915.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5045.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5178.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5315.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5456.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5600.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5748.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":160.56,"local_amount":13287.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":13751.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980873},{"amount":39.57,"local_amount":3274.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3388.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529536},{"amount":68.34,"local_amount":5655.54,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5853.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449657935},{"amount":120.1,"local_amount":9939.47,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10286.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467943867},{"amount":64.2,"local_amount":5313.08,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5498.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479164848},{"amount":65.3,"local_amount":5404.45,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5593.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859490},{"amount":66.85,"local_amount":5532.23,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5725.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287024},{"amount":115.79,"local_amount":9582.34,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":9917.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517571039},{"amount":24.29,"local_amount":2011.06,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2081.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054463}],"funded_date":"2013-06-26T15:28:00Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T13:36:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":575067,"name":"Anhbayar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Anhbayar is 30 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Ger, in Uvs province of Mongolia.

She is 55 years old and started her business endeavors with her beauty salon where Relief International staff had the pleasure to meet her. Her salon is a small, reputable establishment attracting many clients in her neighborhood. \n\nWhile she is proud of her salon and the successes she had with the business, Bayan's passion is her art work. She makes beautiful crepe paper flowers which she displays in various ways on picture frames to hang as 3D art, in vases as simple bouquets or just as simple individual stem of flowers. The lifelike pieces take about 6-8 hours to make and she is constantly trying out new techniques and new type of flowers. Until now she has been working from her home in her spare time on this precious hobby, and then taking her works to various fairs in town where she can sell her products for about 60-80 dollars each. But unfortunately such fairs are infrequent, and also it takes time and money to attend them. And although she now has a lot of nice and finished pieces, she has no place to really display them and sell them. \n\nShe would like refurbish a little back storage space next to the salon, and use it as a small shop for the decorative pieces. The location is really ideal, as the room has a street front, and with some basic work can easily be turned into a cute shop for her works - an ideal start for a business opportunity she is so passionate about. \n\nJust Listen to her short video introduction: \n\"Hello, my name is Bayan. I learned this art and started working with the raw materials when I was a child and till now I enjoy working and improving my craft. And now I hope to make it even better and take it to the next level. I would like to teach the art and have a few people work with me, and together work on creating both clay ceramics and flowers - as you can see - which are made of crepe (or tissue) paper. And I hope to continuously improve my work and results. Thanks!\" \n\nBayan is taking an SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq to finance the refurbishment of the space and open the shop to display her works.

","en":"Shavkat is a hardworking and very active 30 year-old man.  He is married, but does not yet have children.  But Shavkat and his wife love children very much and want to have a large family.  Shavkat started his own business in order to earn a living and have a regular income.  It has now been two years since he got involved in growing potatoes.  He has a small plot of land, where he grows his harvest.  He gathers a good potato harvest every season, then sells the potatoes at a local market and earns a good income for his family.  Dekhan farming is one of the profitable businesses in the locale where he lives.  Many men in the area are involved in this business.

","en":"Maria Luisa is 41 years old and is from the city of Estel\u00ed. She makes a living from the business of tortillas and sells them in her neighborhood. She started this business when her children were small; she couldn't leave them home alone so she made a few tortillas that she sold. With little money she was then able to accomplish what has helped her to get ahead.

He lives in Kobuleti District with his mother. Jano requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nJano has a flat, which is rented out seasonally. His mother works as a cook in a local restaurant.  It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nJano requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Jano has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Jano will open an auto car wash.

He has 5 children and has been doing this work for 30 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, and transportation services.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Selling farm products.' His biggest challenge is 'Raising funds.' Animals on the farm have been given no names.\r\n\r\nJoseph was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'it has approachable officers.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'That loans are given to those in a group.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family?', Joseph replied 'Will educate his children.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.
