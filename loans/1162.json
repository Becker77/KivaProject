members of the group \"Allakabon II\" are married women averaging 39 years of age and five children each, all living in traditional families in Sinsinsa Kinisso, a village in Koutiala (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). They are collaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso with the goal of organizing their farm work better during the rainy season. They are on their eighth loan with the institution. The past loans were indeed paid back.\r\n\r\nThe crop grown is millet, as is the case with Wassa, who is the third person sitting from the left in the photo.

He needs the items for planting. He buys the items in municipality. This takes him 15 minutes by car from the community where he lives. Also, he gets the materials for the making clay dolls from different communities of the department where the clay is removed. This sometimes hinders the process due to the distance he covers to transfer the material. However he always gets an abundance to complete the process.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from Field Foundation will be used to buy 4 pounds of manure, 1 bag of corn seeds, and fungicides for pest control. The other part will be used to obtain raw material for the production of clay dolls. Also he will purchase already developed products by other artisans because demand is high.\r\n\r\nWith the support provided to the customer, he will be able to purchase the fertilizer needed to proceed with the cultivation of 7,000 square meters of corn, which he established to generate a surplus of corn to sell. Also he will strengthen the business making clay dolls.

He is a man who was adopted as a child due to the extreme poverty of his birth family, which decided to give him to another family that would be able to give him what he needed because they had cattle and a respectable house. This is how he began his life with his new family. It was when he was eight years old that he started to be drawn toward farming and the care of animals, and this is how he has managed to achieve what he has today. \r\n\r\nHe buys his agricultural supplies in an area where he can get good prices, and to do so he travels 30 minutes by car.

With them, he hopes that milk production will reach seven to eight bottles a day. He knows this is how to invest the money because selling the milk will cover some of his family's other needs. He has always been dedicated to the care of animals, but they have always been other people's animals. With this loan he will buy his own cow and thus he hopes to continue growing. \r\n\r\nIn the future the client hopes to increase the number of his own animals, which he has dreamed of ever since he was little but has been unable to achieve so far because of his family's financial limitations.

Like their fellow teachers in various areas where Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT) operates, they came to SMT to apply for staff loans. These loans are specifically designed for low-paid staff. With this type of loan, staff can meet their most immediate and pressing needs. At the end of each month, their bursar is directly responsible for deducting their repayments and pays SMT\/Kiva lenders on their behalf.\r\n\r\nSahr is the featured leader of this group.

","en":"Atunoy is a woman with a beautiful soul and a good heart. She is both the family manager and the main breadwinner for the family. She has a husband and three children. Since she was 13 years old, Atunoy has been in business. She sells fabric for sewing traditional women's dresses in the local market. She takes her business very seriously. Atunoy updates her goods seasonally and is expanding her product line. She is introducing her son to business and he helps her. She has lots of experience in business and has gradually developed her business.

She earns 4,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

 Roslyn first became interested in rebuilding families during her time as a Protective Services Assistant (PSA).  As a PSA, she would supervise visits between parents and children, often due to a court mandate or turmoil within the family.  Roslyn became adept at documenting the visits to share with the court.\n\nAfter some time as a PSA, Roslyn earned her credentials to work as a Child Protective Services (CPS) social worker.  After more than 15 years as a CPS social worker, Roslyn wanted to provide even more support to families going through difficult and often heartbreaking situations.  She earned her Doctorate in Clinical Psychology in 2011 and began providing therapy for individuals, couples and families. \n \nDetermined to provide even more specialized services, Roslyn decided to start her own supervised visiting facility, allowing parents in high conflict or high-risk situations access to their children in a safe and supervised environment.  Furthermore, Roslyn\u2019s facility, A Seed of Change, will operate as a community-based outreach program offering additional supportive services to families in crisis, i.e., conflict resolutions skills groups, non-violent communication skills groups, and parenting workshops.\n\nHer Kiva loan will be used to furnish her office with a computer, TV and homey furniture, creating an environment that is safe and nurturing for the clients she serves.  It will also be used to expand her office and secure licenses to connect with the court system.  \n\nWith your help, Roslyn can achieve her dream of rebuilding and caring for struggling families.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5825.66,"image":{"id":1376213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Medical

lives in the Litein area of Kenya. He has one child and has been doing farming work for eight years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, and crops.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: profit. His biggest challenge is 'raising funds for my projects.' Animals on the farm have been given no names.\r\n\r\nWeldon was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied, 'quick loan processing.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. He said that he'd learned 'that the interest rate is 18 percent.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Weldon replied, 'It will better our livelihoods.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Weldon owns the following: a cow, poultry, and a motorcycle. He does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

She is married to Leo, an employee. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMylene operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families, only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. She also has a direct selling business and a laundry shop. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 45,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nMylene hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life.

She is married to Reynaldo, a driver. Together with her husband, Susana manages the household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSusana operates a mobile store. Her mobile store is basically a small houseware store, which retails plastic containers, dipper, pails, plastic flowers and basins to the local neighborhood. She transports her goods around her local community to sell the products. She earns money by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 30, 000. She will use the loan to buy different products, such as dust pans, hangers, basins, pails, pitchers, glassware, laundry baskets, trays and other products needed for her store.\r\n\r\nSusana hopes that her business will grow and have another branch.

He is a hard-working person who lives with his wife and two children.  Jos\u00e9 works as a farmer and also carries out additional work to make income for his family.  For the past four years, he has been raising chickens for meat.  It all started with the idea of marrying the woman who is now his wife.  The couple decided to save some money on their wedding by purchasing 70 chickens to fatten themselves and, without knowing anything about the amount of time it takes a chicken to grow, they did this.  They had to sell the 70 chickens because they developed before their wedding date.  This is how they started their business.  The couple buy the supplies they need such as concentrated feed, vitamins and vaccines in Sensuntepeque because it is the only place where customers receive a good price and technical advice.

He is a hard-working, very humble person who never had the chance to know his father.  It was very difficult for Gregorio growing up without a father and, because he was the eldest son, he was the one who had to help his mother to farm and work for the family.  He started growing his first field of corn at the age of 15 and hasn't stopped working since.  Nobody taught him all the things he knows about farming.  He learned them because he could see the needs of his siblings and mother.\r\n\r\nIn common with other farmers in his area, Gregorio buys his supplies wherever he can get them at the best price and save a few pesos.  He has to travel around 30 minutes by pick-up truck from his community to get to the place where he buys his supplies and this has its price because he has to pay for them to deliver the products to his property, where he loads them onto his back and carries them to his humble home.\r\n\r\nGregorio is requesting this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy three sacks of fertilizer, corn seeds, and herbicides and fungicides to control pests and weeds that can damage his crops.

The cow has been given the name 'Karoi.'\r\n\r\nEsther was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'It gives a grace period.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Interest.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Esther replied 'More yields.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Esther owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1376446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a loan of PHP 20,000 loan.

","en":"Guadalupe is 61 years old, married, and has four children.  She has been working for approximately 40 years to provide for their family, with the help of her husband.  Guadalupe makes tamales and bread to sell and also has a mill for grinding boiled corn which has one hopper.  Her husband used to work as a builder in the area.  He also worked as a farm laborer when building work was scarce.  Together with her family, Guadalupe also cares for 5 head of cattle and grows sorghum over 0.7 hectares in order to provide fodder for their cattle and grain for their farmyard birds.  She also grows corn over 1.4 hectares which is used for her family's own consumption and, if the price is right, she sells some in order to cover some household expenses and the cost of cattle fodder.  The area in which she lives has two well defined seasons: a rainy season when she grows basic grains and fodder for the cattle and a dry season when pasture is scarce and dried out.  There is no natural water source for filling water troughs or watering crops.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe buys her farm supplies in the city.  She has to catch the only bus that services her community or travel by pick-up truck for 15 kilometers.  Then she has to carry her products on her back until she reaches her farmland with her family and whoever else she hires to do this work because her husband is no longer able to work for health reasons.  Fifteen years ago he suffered an accident on a construction site which left him in a coma.  He lost a large part of his reasoning ability as well as his ability to carry out heavy labor.  Guadalupe is practically the only one who provides income for their household.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe will use the loan that she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides and seeds.  She will also pay laborers to farm 0.7 hectares of sorghum and 1.4 hectares of corn.  This loan will allow her to meet the need her family and farmyard birds have for basic grains and provide her cattle with fodder during the dry season.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Guadalupe hopes to be able to work differently, perhaps with her own capital.

They live with her in her own house made of adobe. In the past, Julia farmed cacao and coffee. However, in order to be closer to her children, she decided to open a small business in the door of her home. She currently sells candy, beverages and other items close to a school. Recently, she started to sell icepops and other cold drinks thanks to the purchase of a refrigerator from the previous loan. So that she does not neglect her plots of land, she has decided to rent them to other farmers. This decision also generates earnings. One of her main objectives is to open a grocery store in order to start selling supplies and earn more income.

She lives with her husband and 3 children, whom she loves very much, in the house which she inherited from her mother.  She has worked for many years selling fruit and food on a casual basis, when each fruit is in season.  When there is a glut of citrus fruits, she sells them in the mountains and, as they are very rare in that area, sales are good and she increases her earnings.  She also says that, during holiday periods, she sells food in various town squares around the area, which also provides additional income. She now hopes to buy a large amount of fruit with the capital obtained, but fruit is scarce this year and she has to increase the selling price of her goods.  This is her first loan with KIVA. She is grateful for the help, as it will enable her to make progress with her business and improve her income.  Furthermore, she promises to make her repayments punctually.  Margarita will invest the S\/.1500 soles in the purchase of  a variety of fruit for her business.

Together with her life partner, she has made a living through agriculture for more than five years.  The two of them are alone involved in carrying out all the different work in the fields, like: cleaning, pruning, composting, and fertilizing the coffee plants.  The land that they cultivate is their own, thanks in part to inheriting it from her parents.  It is located in the same area where they live, which makes it much easier to look after their crops.  Her customers are different buyers who come to the area during the season to acquire the product.\r\n\r\nShe has asked COMIXMUL for a loan to buy agricultural supplies for maintaining and taking care of her coffee crops because if they are not treated in time it is likely that they will become full of bugs that will deteriorate the product.

He is a young man that has worked in agriculture for the past 8 years.  His father taught him how to cultivate the land when he was very young, along with his brothers.\r\n\r\nFranklin works in his father's maize field and he also works for small wages for other people in the region.  They pay him 40 dollars every two weeks, which works out to about $2.66 dollars per day.  He doesn't own his own land to cultivate, and so he needs to rent the land.  Even with all of these limitations, he has not lost sight of his dream of improving the living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\nWith the little money that he earns in wages, and with his savings from the sale of surplus items from his harvest, he was able to buy a cow, which has given him three more and he now has four cows.

He has worked in agriculture since he was 15 years old.  Now at 61, he continues caring for and supporting his family via this activity.  His father taught him, along with his four brothers, the technical aspects of cultivating the land.  In the region in which he lives, the majority of the population works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nJulio has a parcel of land very close to his small home, which enables him to work in the mornings and a bit in the afternoon.

The house they have lived in for so long has been deteriorating over the years and its outer and inner components have become fragile and vulnerable. So, Batzaya is requesting a loan of 7000000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, planks, cement, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, her husband will repair and insulate their old house. The renovated house will enable the family to reduce coal consumption thus releasing less pollutants into the atmosphere, which contributes to the efforts against air pollution.

Like the other members of the group, Fatoumata's goal is to continue to strengthen her business through partnership with Soro Yiriwaso."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1379728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy \"pagnes\" (colorful West African fabrics) and bed sheets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata Issa           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhiara                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makiatou             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dicko                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soumaita             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":167322.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678697},{"amount":333.34,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":167322.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924310},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":167322.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207501},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:51:17Z","rounded_local_amount":167322.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972174},{"amount":333.34,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":167322.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624769},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":167322.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850776}],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T10:51:49Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":574796,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma, 48, is single and lives in Linao Norte.

With the help of African Solar Rise, he wrote a business plan and started selling solar products to his passengers. Furthermore, he developed the idea of his own \"Solar Bajaji Project\": to create awareness about solar energy he wants to equip his own bajaji with solar products so that his passengers can experience this ecological energy solution during their ride through Dar es Salaam. With a Kiva loan we can make this project come true, and Zawadi can buy his own bajaji to equip it with solar products.\n\nDue to his organisational skills, the repayment of the loan won't be any problem for Zawadi.

She is married and has 2 children, one a baby in her arms, and the older attends pre-school.\n\nFrom a very young age, Concepcion has been a working woman, since she didn't have much schooling. She learned to work and what she liked most is selling, because she can work according to her schedule and the weather. When she began peddling, she sold papayas but, at present, she sells men and women's clothing. Concepcion sells door to door among friends and acquaintances. She has done this for 3 years and is very pleased because she has gained good customers and, on occasions, they order by special request. Concepcion is also selling bream once a week and thus earning extra. What she likes most about her business is that during all this time, she has aided her husband in offering a better life for their children.\n\nA loan from Kiva will help her buy a variety of shirts, blouses, T-shirts, underwear, dresses, skirts and pants.\n\n\nIn the future, she would like for her business to continue growing and making improvements to her home. Her long-range goal is to offer education for her children.\n\nThe group is grateful for the help offered by these loans. The remaining members of the group are:\n\nAna sells silver accessories\nMaria sells shoes\nAdela sells tortilla dough\nMargarita sell shoes\nNarcisa offers sewing services\nArcelia sells soft drinks \nAlisia sells soft drinks\nPaulina offers taxi services\nPaula sells clothing\nAgripina sells tortillas\nAna Leidi sells clothing"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1372096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to

This is a fairly profitable business because canned products are in demand year around, which provides Oimpocho with a stable and regular income.  At the present time, Oimpocho requested a loan for business development.  She wants to use this loan to purchase mineral fertilizers and fuel for the tomato and cucumber harvests, and also to buy jars and lids for canning.  Oimpocho intends to use the resulting profit from selling canned cucumbers and tomatoes and also from savings that her sons send to marry off her sons this year, who are currently working abroad.

Her name is Nigora. She is 39 years old, married and raising two children. Her place of residence has very favorable climate for growing agricultural crops and also for livestock breeding. \r\n\r\nNigora has worked with livestock breeding for more than seven years. She sells livestock which she has looked after for a period of a few months. She has many customers at the market. \r\n\r\nNigora would like to develop her business, but does not have sufficient means for this.
