honest and hard working man. He is married and has two children. His wife stays at home to raise the children. Faiziev raises livestock, an activity he has been involved with since he was seven years old. He always dreamed of being educated, but financial issues stopped him from pursuing that goal, so he is now raising animals. However, he does like his work because he receives a good income from it. Since Faiziev has two children he is doing everything he can to provide them with all they need. He dreams that his children will study in the best educational institutions and work in their chosen specialties. Currently Faiziev is planning to expand his herd and wants to buy more livestock. He recently learned from friends about the organization Arvand and decided to apply for a loan, since he does not have enough cash to buy the animals. Faiziev thanks you ahead of time for your support.

He is married and has four wonderful children. He and his family live in a rural town. The children attend the local school and Najmiddin and his wife try to do everything possible to ensure that they are well educated and prepared for the future. Najmiddin started his own business because he wanted a steady income. Now it has already been 18 years since he started raising animals to sell. He has a field near his home where the livestock can graze. His wife also helps him. She cares for the animals and milks the cows. Najmiddin himself also works in the local hospital, which provides additional income. But the more predictable and stable income comes from selling livestock. The house where Najmiddin and his family lives feels too small, since the children are growing and need more room.

","en":"Shakar is a wonderful older woman. She is married and has three grown children. Shakar has had a good married life: her husband understands her and helps with everything. Shakar is an active woman: she always likes to have something to do. People even call her a town activist. She works in the school as a janitor, which earns her additional income. She also spends a lot of time helping her children raise their children. But she has her own business which earns her a stable income to cover living expenses: she raises livestock. Right now she has two animals. The business brings her a good profit, which covers food, but not enough for the other needs of the family. For example, Shakar's house is in bad shape and needs major repairs, but they don't yet have the financial resources to pay for them. Shakar herself dreams of building a large house with good living conditions where she could live with her children and grandchildren. But to do that she will need to increase her income so that she can save for construction. This is why Shakar wants a loan: so that she can buy several head of livestock to expand her business and save the resulting income for construction of a new house. She hopes for your support and thanks you in advance. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1377892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shakar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":68.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":73.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":76.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":84.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":87.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":89.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":96.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":99.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.51},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15.51,"local_amount":68.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":73.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616149},{"amount":16.03,"local_amount":71.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":76.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860019},{"amount":16.58,"local_amount":73.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":78.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136764},{"amount":17.13,"local_amount":76.17,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":81.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900960},{"amount":17.72,"local_amount":78.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":84.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550142},{"amount":142.03,"local_amount":631.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":676.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774363}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T18:09:02Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":575614,"name":"Sughra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sughra is 29 years old, and the responsible mother of 2 children.

For the last three months, he has had around $60\/day in sales on average (just mobile phone airtime credit sales). \r\n\r\nAs the business continues, he hopes to get a Kiva loan as a working capital loan in order to do more transactions on weekends.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1376603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Selatan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pangestu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":214.2,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2233068.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.8,"payment_id":419961858}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T13:53:42Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:26:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":577138,"name":"Ana Gloria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nAna tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene dos hijos.

She has been farming since she was a young girl.  At the age of 12 her dad would take her along with him when he went out to farm.  She says that he told her \"it will help you when you have your own family\".  Now that she does have her own family, it is indeed helping her.  Her farming has allowed her to help her husband.  In addition to this work, Ana also owns a small store which she is working hard to stock because the farm work is becoming very tiring.  For this reason, her dream is to have a well-established store.  Ana gets up very early, at 5.00am, to prepare her husband's breakfast as she has never liked him to go out without his morning coffee.\r\n\r\nAna sometimes buys the materials that she needs for her farm work in the city.  To catch the bus to the city she has to first walk for 30 minutes.  If she doesn't catch a motorcycle taxi it is a long journey.\r\n\r\nAna is requesting this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy a bag of seed, two gallons of herbicides, 11 sacks of fertilizer and two liters of pesticides.  Through this investment, she will buy the supplies she needs for her crops as winter has already begun and her corn fields need fertilizing.\r\n\r\nAna would like to expand her small store as the farm work is becoming very tiring as she grows older.

So she wants to increase this to help her family have a higher income.\r\n\r\nWorking capital loans to Ruma agents allow them to process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions. Each Ruma agent has a balance with Ruma that allows them to sell mobile phone credit or process bill payments.  When the balance is at zero, the agent cannot process any additional sales or bill payments and has to top up their balance by giving Ruma field officers cash in exchange for electronic credit. \r\n\r\nFor operational efficiency, Ruma can collect from agents only as frequently as once a day and cannot collect on the weekend when banks are closed and cash can't be safely deposited there.  As a result, agents often have lower sales on the weekend and have unfulfilled potential to make more transactions during weekdays when their balances are empty.  \r\n\r\nThis working capital loan allows credit-worthy borrowers to reach their full sales potential. The loan is structured like a line of credit that the borrower uses and repays as needed during the loan term.  At the end of the term, the borrower is responsible for paying back any outstanding balance so that the total amount can be returned to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1376633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Serang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":207.38,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2233068.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.62,"payment_id":439841518}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T09:58:18Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":577168,"name":"Lucia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucia vive en casa propia con su esposo y sus dos hijos, ella se dedica a la venta de ropa interior para damas desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, el negocio lo tiene ubicado en su lugar de residencia tiene mucha clientela pues sus productos son de muy buena calidad y a precios muy c\u00f3modos, con las ganancias que obtiene de sus ventas y con la ayuda de su esposo   logran solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, lucia esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de mas mercader\u00eda por mayor para seguir con su negocio y poderle dar a su familia una mejor estabilidad econ\u00f3mica.","en":"Lucia lives in her own home with her husband and two children.

Each Ruma agent has a balance with Ruma that allows them to sell mobile phone credit or process bill payments. When the balance is at zero, the agent cannot process any additional sales or bill payments and has to top up their balance by giving Ruma field officers cash in exchange for electronic credit.  \r\n\r\nFor operational efficiency, Ruma can collect from agents only as frequently as once a day and cannot collect on the weekend when banks are closed, and cash can't be safely deposited there. As a result, agents often have lower sales on the weekend and have unfulfilled potential to make more transactions during weekdays when their balances are empty.  \r\n\r\nThis working capital loan allows credit-worthy borrowers to reach their full sales potential. The loan is structured like a line of credit that the borrower uses and repays as needed during the loan term. At the end of the term, the borrower is responsible for paying back any outstanding balance so that the total amount can be returned to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1376637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Serang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.54,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chara","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":253.46,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2729306.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.54,"payment_id":439841519}],"funded_date":"2013-06-30T14:08:35Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":577169,"name":"San Jose Obrero Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 \u201cSan Jose Obrero\u201d se form\u00f3 con la uni\u00f3n de varias vecinas de la ciudad de Santan\u00ed, una ciudad con dif\u00edcil acceso a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n.

Paynesville North has the largest market in Montserrado County. The area is home to \u201cround time marketers\u201d, traders that travel to the interior to purchase various goods to sell throughout the county.

For the past many days, his rickshaw has not been working properly and because of this, he is unable to generate any income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Aashi has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing his rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

Bwanda, Buhunga, Rukungiri District. He is an agriculturalist who grows tomatoes in the same area where he lives. He has two children' one is 6 months old and the other is 2 years old; therefore, none of them is in school. \r\n\r\nBoaz\u2019s current business is an inheritance from his father, who is now 90.

For the past many days, his rickshaw has not been working properly and because of this, he is unable to generate any income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Parveen, as a member of a three-person lending group has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing his rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

Several years ago, Ne\u00f3fita was in delicate health and because of this she opened a food store.

She started this business by selling to her friends, which led her to establish her own business, and she learned this way of selling from her friends.

She is a good person and very responsible.  She is married and has two children, whom she loves very much.  Cimi is currently living in a rented house, alongside her husband and young ones, and is fighting to move ahead in life.  Cimi mends and makes clothes.  She has a workshop in her home and has been doing this work for sixteen years.  She learned her trade from a young age, when she worked for another woman who was a seamstress.  Little by little, and with a lot of patience, Cimi learned the dressmaking skills and decided to work independently.  Putting the skills she had been taught by her previous employer into practice, Cimi was able to earn her own income.  Now Cimi has a workshop with a business partner.  In the time she has worked in this business, Cimi has always looked for the best way to her job.  On many occasions, pressure from customers has made Cimi feel that she was not going to complete the work efficiently.  However, she has faced her difficulties and now has plans to expand her business, though she knows that the path to this is long and so it is a long-term goal.  At the moment Cimi is preparing to start creating her own designs to sell, as she has orders from customers.

They work with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to be able to do their agricultural work during the winter season. They are on their fifth loan with the institution, the previous loans having all been repaid. \r\nThe crop grown is the peanut in the case of Awa, the second person in from the right on the photo. With her loan, she intends to buy soil inputs, seeds and small farming equipment, and to pay the costs of ploughing the 0.5 hectare plot. The crop will be sold, following the harvest, in the village and in San, to both men and women customers.\r\nShe plans to make a profit of 12,000 FCFA per harvest. This profit will allow her to repay her loan, and also to help her husband with the daily expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1380003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase soil inputs, seeds and small farming tools, and to pay for ploughing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Djalakoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T09:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T09:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":360000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":360000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":363926.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459219979}],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T17:58:12Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:29:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alistair Assheton","image":1674519}},{"id":575693,"name":"Sajida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sajida is a 27-year-old married woman.

For the past 2 years, she has been successfully running a business of selling milk with the support of her husband. The man shown in the picture is her husband. She milks cows and then her husband sells the milk along with yoghurt to people in their community. Over time, Abida has become famous in her area for providing good quality milk.

She is a 47-year-old married mother of four children, standing on the left in the picture. In her daily life, she works as an employee in a printing house. Her husband owns a small gypsum manufacturing business. Her children are enrolled in private high schools, which means that she has to cover the tuition fees on top of her other expenses. The Al Majmoua loan would be truly beneficial, because it would help her develop her own business, especially through buying newly released accessories. Rouhaifa is a 46-year-old married mother of three children, standing at the right of the picture. She is Noura's colleague in the printing house. Her husband works in construction as a painter. Her three children are enrolled in private high schools. The exhibition would help her a lot in raising the family\u2019s income, thus covering the tuition expenses. Itidal is a 38-year-old married mother of two children, standing in the center of the picture. She is employed in a shop that arranges flowers for weddings.

His biggest challenge is insufficient funds. Animals on the farm have been given the name of Lelkina.\r\n\r\nWhen Dennis was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, he replied that it was because of fast loan processing. He was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, to which he responded, 'It gives dairy loans.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked how this loan would benefit his family Dennis replied that the family income will increase.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Dennis owns a cow and a bicycle but does not own pigs, poultry, a pump, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a mosquito net in the household but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1376770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to construct a zero-grazing unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dennis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4314.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4428.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4545.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4665.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4789.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4915.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5045.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5178.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5315.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5456.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5600.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5748.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.08,"local_amount":8944.68,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9263.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980890},{"amount":56.19,"local_amount":4650.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4816.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880940},{"amount":57.68,"local_amount":4773.36,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:34:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4943.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529559},{"amount":207.47,"local_amount":17169.91,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":17782.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449657961},{"amount":64.69,"local_amount":5353.4,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5544.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343319},{"amount":67.21,"local_amount":5562.25,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5760.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467943889},{"amount":163.68,"local_amount":13545.96,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":14029.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479164869}],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T23:28:56Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T12:14:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kavita Shah","image":780734}},{"id":575851,"name":"Alphonsine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alphonsine is 24 years old.

Her first connection with PT Ruma was six months ago, when she was introduced by a relative to join Ruma. Now, six months later, her average revenue per day can reach USD 130. Now she is focused to expand her mobile phone credit sales. \r\n\r\nWorking capital loans to Ruma agents allow them to process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions. Each Ruma agent has a balance with Ruma that allows him or her to sell mobile phone credit or process bill payments. When the balance is at zero, the agent cannot process any additional sales or bill payments and has to top up their balance by giving Ruma field officers cash in exchange for electronic credit. For operational efficiency, Ruma can collect from agents only as frequently as once a day and cannot collect on the weekend when banks are closed and cash can't be safely deposited there. As a result, agents often have lower sales on the weekend and have unfulfilled potential to make more transactions during weekdays when their balances are empty.\r\n  \r\nThis working capital loan allows credit-worthy borrowers to reach their full sales potential. The loan is structured like a line of credit that the borrower uses and repays as needed during the loan term. At the end of the term, the borrower is responsible for paying back any outstanding balance so that the total amount can be returned to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1376699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Serang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T14:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T14:30:13Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Siva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":345.63,"local_amount":3500000,"processed_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3721781.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.37,"payment_id":439841526}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T15:31:26Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":575860,"name":"Tiennie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tiennie is 38 years old and lives in the West Point area, which has the most populated market in Montserrado County.

She felt blessed for her opportunity, but wanted a way to help her family further.  As a single mother of two daughters, Maria also wanted to have time for her daughters to teach them the work ethic and values imparted to her. \n \nMaria used her business sense and skills to develop a business model that would address all of her family needs and help her achieve her personal goals.  Her motto has been, \u201cYou can always do more.  You can make money doing the right thing.\u201d  Following her motto, she started her own business, Mayan Commercial and Residential Cleaning Services, in June 2012. \n \nSince then, Maria has been able to employ her family members, spend more time with her daughters and expand her business to cover three large commercial locations, servicing over 35,000 ft of retail space.  Maria shares that she enjoys the challenge, and that her deep commitment to integrity and her ambition to provide a better life for her family is what motivates her to succeed.  \n\nMaria\u2019s Kiva loan will be used to purchase a commercial carpet cleaning machine, which will enable her business to service large, retail flooring locations and provide an additional service to her growing clientele.  With your help, Maria can continue to make a positive impact on her family and her community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so thankful for Kiva, and for the opportunities that Kiva lenders create.

children and 2 dependents of his brother who died of cancer five years ago. He grew up with only his mother as his father was not known to him, which made his life difficult. \n\nBeing pushed by the need to survive and to support his mother, he started banana farming on a small scale on the land he got from his grandmother. This banana plantation was used as a source of food for the family and income for their survival. This business has grown, giving him an opportunity to support his family and dependents. He also managed to construct a house for his family. He is requesting a loan of UGX.4,000,000 to complete the house. He is excited that soon he will be in a position to house his children in modest accommodations.In the photo is Denis with his wife who signed the waiver

Entre sus planes futuros Orlando planea obtener un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para amurallar su domicilio puesto que actualmente no tiene muralla.","en":"Orlando is a hard-working young man who is married and has a 5-year-old son.  The family currently lives in a poor area of Cochabamba in their own home that they managed to buy a few years ago as a result of Orlando's work providing a transport service.  Orlando currently needs to finish building his home as the house still doesn't meet the basic requirements for his young son and family to lead a decent life in a healthy environment.  Orlando's future plans include taking out a further loan to build a wall around his home as it currently doesn't have

Sumitra is one of them. The lady standing second from the left in the photo raising her hand is Sumitra; aged 30, she is a very poor tribal lady, and lives with her husband and her nephew. Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day.\r\n\r\nSumitra has been running a general store in her small village for last 12 years. Her nephew supplements in her business. She sells general grocery items like oil, sugar, lentils, biscuits, soft drinks (sodas) and stationery such as books, pens, etc. Sumitra was able to increase the variety of items at her general store with her scanty savings and increase her cash flow. \r\n\r\nHer monthly income from the existing business is 6000 Indian Rupees (INR). Out of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses and spent some income for construction of a small shop cabin. As per the statement she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase stock of her business. So the loan amount will be utilized to purchase items like lentils, oil, dal, soap, biscuits, potatoes etc. in bulk for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock less frequently. Sumitra hopes to save enough for building a good house for her family as the present house is very small and congested.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Pramila, Jamuna and Kumari who are running a tyre repairing center, a general shop and a goat business respectively.

Sandy will continue trying to turn her dream into a reality: \"to own her own house and have a big restaurant.\" "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1379438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy tables, chairs, an awning, a freezer, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T17:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T17:50:13Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandy Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":199.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":211.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":215.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":224.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":235.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":242.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":253.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":261.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":271.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":285.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":293.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":304.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.64,"local_amount":199.93,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":200.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776340},{"amount":75.7,"local_amount":211.25,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":211.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779344},{"amount":77.36,"local_amount":215.89,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":215.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054537},{"amount":80.37,"local_amount":224.28,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":224.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819440},{"amount":84.48,"local_amount":235.76,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":235.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472389},{"amount":177.7,"local_amount":495.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":496.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694872},{"amount":93.69,"local_amount":261.47,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":261.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067416},{"amount":97.33,"local_amount":271.63,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":271.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880337},{"amount":207.45,"local_amount":578.9,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":579.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479103902},{"amount":109.28,"local_amount":304.97,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":305.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490798996}],"funded_date":"2013-07-10T22:22:05Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:06:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":576019,"name":"Peris","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peris is a Kiva borrower, age 47 years.

","en":"Gulnora is a middle-aged woman. She born and raised in the city of Isfara in Tajikistan. She's married, has two children, and makes a living by selling women's clothing on the local market. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing school, Gulnora attended a local college studying to become a teacher. Upon graduation, she started working in a local kindergarten. During that time, her children were small, and Gulnora's income was sufficient to support them. However, her children have grown now and, therefore, so have the expenses. Gulnora decided to supplement her income by becoming a saleswoman and selling women's clothing on the market. She gradually learned the nuances of the trade and then started importing the products herself. \r\n\r\nGulnora has worked with Arvand since 2010.

It is very difficult for them to manage the household expenses; they are facing many problems in life. \r\n\r\nSince 2010, Shumaila has been running a small general store to generate a second source of income for her family. She has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to expand her business. She wants to buy a variety of goods like milk, sugar, rice, soap, detergents, creams, etc and introduce some new items in her general store to fulfill the demands of her customers.  She also wants to increase her savings. \r\n\r\nShe would reinvest the profit in the general store, use a part of it to pay her household expenses, and use part on the education of her children. \r\n\r\nShe is very thankful to KIVA and BRAC Pakistan for their support.

All of her sons are very hardworking and help their father in his business a lot.\r\n\r\nUzma  has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband in his business. Her husband would purchase a wood cutting machine and some wood material for his shop. As they have no other source of income, her husband will be able to continue his business with the help of this loan, and with the net profit he will open a new shop for his son. Uzma dreams for her children's bright future and prays for her husband's good health.

Olguita believes she\u2019s getting ahead because she\u2019s very kind to customers and always provides good service.\r\n\r\nOlguita is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support they\u2019ve given her she will be able to buy a sewing machine since her current machine is in bad shape and she will be able to do her work on time and take care of more customers more quickly which will lead to improved income so she can continue to strive to make her greatest dream reality: to have a sewing workshop and to provide her son with a university career.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1379464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olguita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":113.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":137.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":148.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":153.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":160.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.57,"local_amount":113.52,"processed_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":118.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664621},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":121.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":127.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776347},{"amount":46.97,"local_amount":125.25,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":131.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779348},{"amount":48.93,"local_amount":130.48,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":136.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054541},{"amount":340.81,"local_amount":908.83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":951.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819444}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T20:10:52Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":576043,"name":"Zalvie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zalvie is a hardworking entrepreneur who has had a fish vending business in the Philippines for 5 years.

","en":"Daler is a cheerful young man aged 25. He is married and already has three children despite his age. Daler and his family live with his parents in a small village. He has to work hard to provide for his family and for his parents, as he is their eldest son. He earns a steady income working as a craftsman in a local workshop. Daler's wife also helps earn money for the family by cleaning part-time at a local school. Her salary is quite small but provides additional income for the family. Daler has a younger brother who has graduated from high school, but he can't go to college because of financial problems. Now his brother wants to go to Russia with a friend to find work and prepare to apply for college, so Daler came to MDO Arvand and asked for a loan to buy his little brother a plane ticket. He hopes everything will turn out well and thanks MDO Arvand for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1377882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy his little brother a plane ticket to look for work in Russia.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daler","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":170.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":176.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":182.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":189.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":195.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":202.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":209.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":216.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":224.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":232.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.23,"local_amount":170.48,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":172.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136765},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":176.45,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":178.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900961},{"amount":38.81,"local_amount":182.62,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":184.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550143},{"amount":40.16,"local_amount":189.01,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":191.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774364},{"amount":41.58,"local_amount":195.63,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":198.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673498},{"amount":43.02,"local_amount":202.48,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":205.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144289},{"amount":187.71,"local_amount":883.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":894.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960112}],"funded_date":"2013-07-28T19:39:59Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":576070,"name":"Horn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Horn is a rural villager from the Srey Snom district of Siem Reap province and also a mother of five children.

Having no source of income to depend on except subsistence farming, Aidah resorted to selling charcoal since it was in demand by the town dwellers who can not afford gas, let alone the high cost of electricity. Through the sales she has managed to save some money to pay for her children's tuition as well as meet other household demands. \r\n\r\nBecause her capital base was so small she, together with eleven other members from the same village, sought out financial assistance. There was no better alternative than Ugafode since the other institutions in their reach are commercial banks that can not lend to her category of people (rural poor). \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy more stock such that she can increase her profits and buy a plot of land on which she will build a residential house in the future. She is a hardworking woman, though her challenges are that she has no alternative sources of income and has to strain the business for all the household needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":1377332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy charcoal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lyantonde","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sula","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sulaiman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane Frances","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atanasi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gertrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":866666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":866666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":866666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":866666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":866666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":866666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":866666,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":876622.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689691},{"amount":311.54,"local_amount":800002,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":809192.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480823},{"amount":363.46,"local_amount":933332.01,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":944054.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879973},{"amount":64.9,"local_amount":166666.99,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":168581.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983630},{"amount":318.03,"local_amount":816666,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":826048.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635739},{"amount":296.79,"local_amount":762126,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":770881.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863187},{"amount":268.13,"local_amount":688541,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":696451.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752975},{"amount":64.65,"local_amount":166000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":167907.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490974231}],"funded_date":"2013-07-25T02:12:49Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T19:49:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":576093,"name":"Good People Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet with members of the Good People Group from Kenema, a city in eastern Sierra Leone.

She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is that sometimes fish are scarce in the wharf.  \r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to buy more fish for resale.

He is married and has three children.  He lives with his family in his parents' home in a little village.  His parents help him and his wife raise their children.  Because Sirojiddin and his wife work more often than not, Sirojiddin's parents spent the most time with the children.  Living in a little village, it's impossible to find good paying work so it is necessary to run your own business to provide an income.  For 10 years, Sirrojiddin has worked with livestock.  Since his early years, he has helped his father in this same business.  From raising and selling cattle, Sirojiddin earns a good income.  He also has a stall at a market where he exchanges currency.  This business brings in additional money.  His wife also earns a living.  She works as an in-home nurse, having earned her degree in the field.  Neighbors hire her to care for their sick and to give injections and she receives money for these services.  Sirojiddin's children are growing and so are their needs.  He wants his children to study at a good school in a city.  Therefore, he plans to expand his livestock business in order to earn more profits and take care of his children's needs.  He needs to buy more cows and to do so, he has turned to Arvand for a loan.  He is grateful for the support.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of three children. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. For many days his rickshaw has not been working properly because of which he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, as a member of a five person lending group, Rozi has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of six children. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. For many days his rickshaw has not been working properly, and because of this he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore Alies, as a member of this four-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing his rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

This is Ramatu a women in her early forties from Tombo Western rural area in Freetown. She is married to a fisherman and is blessed with 3 children between the ages 7 and 20. Two of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nRamatu runs a cookery business at home, and sells local cooking at her house. She has been running this business since 2008. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 6 days per week. Ramatu says that the main challenge to her business is that if sometimes the food is not sold it will spoil.\r\n\r\nRamatu has requested a loan in order to buy food ingredients to expand her cookery business. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and renovate her house. In the future, she plans to educate her children up to college level . She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1377376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She says that the main challenge to her business is, sometimes people who owe her money don't pay.\r\n\r\nSarah requires a loan in order to buy knives, food containers, and plates to resell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her standard of living. In the future, Sarah plans to begin importing her goods. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1377356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

Rugiatu started her business in 2008 because the income earned by her husband, a fisherman, was not enough to support the family. She tells us that the main obstacle to her enterprise is lack of capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nRugiatu has requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone in order to purchase more items such as alcohol, milk, cigarettes, and biscuits to offer for sale.
