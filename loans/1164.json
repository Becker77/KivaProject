","en":"Mirshakar is a young man, age 23.  He's not yet married, but plans to wed soon and is searching for a fiance.  Mirshakar lives with his parents in a rural village.  He helps his parents in every way, he loves them very much, respects them, and cares about their health.  After finishing school, Mirshakar began helping neighboring shepherds, assisting while the cattle grazed in pastures.  Now, it's been three years since Mirshakar started his own livestock business.  He fattens and sells cattle and receives good profits from it.  His parents help him with the business--his father buys and cells the animals, and his mother cares for them.  Mirshakar also works as a secretary at a high school to earn additional income.  Each month, he has to spend large amounts of money on medication for his parents to keep them in good health.  Therefore, Mishakar wants to expand his business and increase his herd to increase his profits from sales.  He currently has three cows and wants to buy a few more.  With this goal in mind, he has turned to Arvand to take out a loan to buy the animals.  He hopes for a positive outcom and is grateful to Arvand for the support.

Thirty vendors from fifteen nearby villages come to her factory for taking the product. \r\n\r\nBhanubai says that owing to better quality, design, packing and forms of her products, there is a lot of demand from the locality, but due to shortage of stock, she is not able to meet the demands. She now wants to buy more stock of oil, dough, sugar, etc. with the present loan to increase her production level to meet the demand and grab her customers. \r\n\r\nFrom the increased income, Bhanubai dreams to start an ice cream factory for the next summer season. She also hopes to save money from the sale proceeds for providing a better education facility to her children.\r\n\r\nThe other three active members of the group are Sadabadi, Mangalbai and Simadini, who are running a biriyani restaurant, fish business and tyre-repairing center respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1377359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase oil, dough, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Gadramunda,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#TeamGuysHoldingFish"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhanubai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sadabadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mangalbai ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simadini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-08T03:55:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":576051,"name":"Mab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mab, age 39, is a cassava farmer.

After finishing high school, she did not continue her education since her parents immediately married her off.  Since that time, she has worked in the home, caring for her husband and children.  However, to provide an income for her family, both she and her husband run a small business.  Zuhro works at a market and sells food goods.  She is consistently developing her business and now has her own stall to sell from as well as space to expand her inventory.  Her husband works as a farmer.  Together, they bring home a good income which is enough to provide for the family.  However, Zuhro and her husband dream of building their own home where they will live with their children and their children's families.  Now, they live in a small little home that doesn't provide very favorable conditions.  Therefore, Zuhro has begun purchasing building materials for their home.  Now, she wants to take out a loan through Arvand to buy more construction materials.  She relies on the support which will allow her to improve the quality of life for her family.

She is a widow with three children. She is an older woman who works hard every day to get ahead and reach her life goals. She grew up with her parents, who taught her to work in agriculture and on the coffee farms in the area. Her parents owned a small store where she learned the business. Encarnaci\u00f3n got married at the age of 18 and had three children who are now grown. Her husband died 28 years ago, and her children emigrated to the United States. She now lives with her five grandchildren in her home. She used to work selling vegetables in the city market. She would have to walk 45 minutes from the mountains where she lives, and then take the bus to the city. She now has a small store in her community which provides an income for her family.\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the city. To get there, she has to walk. It often takes 45 minutes to get to the village where she catches the bus for the city. She then brings her products back to her community to sell them. She sells basic staples such as beans, corn, rice, and oil. She also sells medicine and other household products.\r\nThis loan, which she is requesting from Fundacion Campo, is for the purchase of bricks, cement, and sand, and to pay labourers to install a floor in her home. They currently have a dirt floor and she wants to install brick. With this investment, she will have a more dignified home. She has built her home through great hard work, and now she needs bricks so that she and her grandchildren can live a better life. They currently run the risk of getting infections in their feet from the humidity.\r\nShe plans to buy a larger display case to display her products, and to help her grandchildren with their studies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1380010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy bricks, cement, and sand, and to pay labourers to install a floor in her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Encarnaci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":351.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":397.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":450.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":351.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":397.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":356.23,"local_amount":356.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":356.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716121},{"amount":395.6,"local_amount":395.6,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":395.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242429},{"amount":448.17,"local_amount":448.17,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:25:39Z","rounded_local_amount":448.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769971}],"funded_date":"2013-07-24T08:14:40Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:25:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":576180,"name":"Felecidad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felecidad is 60 years old and married with four children.\r\n\r\nFelecidad works hard to provide for her family.

She lives in her parents' house with her 3 siblings. Julia works by selling beef. For this business, she has a stand in the main market of her town, where she cheerfully attends to her customers. She started the business 3 years ago with her own capital since she saw the need to earn her own source of income. At first, she had help from her parents but slowly became independent. She likes her business because it allows her to interact with people. Also, the income she earns lets her contribute to household expenses along with her parents, and pay for school. On the other hand, she doesn't like that some customers ask to purchase on credit, which she doesn't allow because she has had bad experiences with those type of sales. She has plans to implement her business and keep growing and earning more income. \r\n\r\nAt this time, she is requesting 3,800 soles and she is very happy to have the financial help provided to her, which allows her to move forward in her job.

This has been his greatest ability and is something for which he has an aptitude. Previously, Luis was further out of town from an important shopping center in the southern area of the cry. However, he relocated and now he is in an area intended for street vendors to set up. \r\n\r\nHe works from 9am to 9pm Monday through Sunday without breaks. The competition is high in this area, but they respect and support each other. He works in the service sector, which attracts customers. The Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo gave him a loan before, which helped him in the 2012 season to buy belts, buckles, and women's and men's accessories. This slowly increased his merchandise stock, his working capital, sales liquidity, and the subtleties of the business.\r\n\r\nHis biggest dream is to have his own home and increase his small business. With the last loan, he improved his liquid working capital and family income. He is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n and wants to keep receiving financial aid so he can keep progressing in his business and family life. This is his first Kiva loan, which he will invest in the same products as with the first loan: belts, glasses, wallets, and glasses cases among other items. This will increase his sales and the usefulness of his business. With the loan, he will have a good supply because it is in a good location and he will offer fair prices, which is the success of his Kiva loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1379440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy belts, glasses, buckles, and glasses cases.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Yair","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":89193},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":108369},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111620},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":114968},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118417},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":121970},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":125629},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":129398},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":133280},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":137278},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":141397},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":168481}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.21},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.57,"local_amount":89193,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:22Z","rounded_local_amount":91571.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817545},{"amount":57.8,"local_amount":108369,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":111258.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323822},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":111620,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-25T09:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":114596.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083051},{"amount":61.31,"local_amount":114968,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":118033.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062398},{"amount":63.16,"local_amount":118417,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":121574.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732101},{"amount":65.05,"local_amount":121970,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":125222.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415321},{"amount":67,"local_amount":125629,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":128979.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104472},{"amount":69.01,"local_amount":129525,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-28T08:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":132979.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919380},{"amount":309.57,"local_amount":580309,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":595784.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140182}],"funded_date":"2013-07-28T20:00:58Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:27:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Polenske","image":1311923}},{"id":576214,"name":"Soek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soek, 59, has seven children.

Beginning at the age of 20, Joseph worked for a masonry company where he perfected his trade and worked independently on the side.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Ohio, Joseph moved to Austin, Texas at a young age. Once he began working, he noticed there was a need for masonry work on residential and commercial buildings that were considered \u201csmall contracts.\u201d As most general contractors decided those projects were too small, Joseph decided to pick them up.\r\n\r\nIn April 2013, Joseph decided to officially brand himself as a professional businessman and registered his business titling it V2R Masonry Systems. He is the sole employee at the moment but predicts that once he obtains his first project, he will be able to hire an average of five employees.\r\n\r\nTo deter a delay in finalizing the start-up business, Joseph searched online for small business loans where he first learned about Accion Texas Inc. \r\n\r\nThe $5,450 loan allowed the 37-year-old father of one to advertise his business and bid on those contracts \u201ctoo small\u201d for general contractors. Now that his business has started, Joseph says he is able \u201cto advertise my company to general contractors in a professional manner.\u201d His next step is to complete his website, www.v2rmasonry.com\/, and create social media profiles to further advertise his business.

In Nepal, large supermarkets are rare. Instead, most items can be found in the small, densely packed pasals that line the streets of every city and village. Piled high with utensils, paper goods, and anything else one would need, these stores are your one-stop shop in Nepal. Although usually packed into a space no larger than 100 square feet, these stores carry a sizeable and diverse inventory. With the help of a Kiva loan, pasal owners are able to keep inventory up and their customers happy. Competition is fierce, but with extra capital and a bit of creativity, the opportunity for profit is there.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

In addition to its beautiful attractions, visitors to Bali can also see the most dominant industry - locals working in the agricultural sector. The people of Bali not only work in the fields, but also raise pigs. In this case, raising pigs is mostly done by the housewife. However, due to constraints, they are not familiar with the best way to raise pigs. To increase their knowledge in animal husbandry, the women agreed to form a group that will be able to exchange information about how to raise pigs in a good and right way. They will also get funding to improve their business.\r\n\r\nNi Luh Gede is a 38-year-old housewife, and is the leader of the Sari Rasa group. To enhance their ability to raise pigs and get capital for their businesses, the group decided to request a loan through MUK. Ni Luh Gede's loan portion will be used to purchase four piglets and feed. The pig will then be ready for re-sale within six months.

She will keep the piglets for five months and then sell them to a pig buyer. Because it is nearly holiday season, the price for pigs is increasing.

He was also asked what he learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'That it uplifts the living standards of smallholder farmers.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Geoffrey replied 'In paying school fees for his children.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Geoffrey owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, solar power, TV' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1377905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, David will start trading with fruits and vegetables. He will purchase stocks of product at wholesale prices and sell it with a price markup at the local market. David will earn a good profit with his new business. Part of the profit will be used to reinvest, and another part for the family.  \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will give David an opportunity to improve the living conditions of the family and insure a better life for his children. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1377964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To buy fruits and vegetables at wholesale prices to sell in the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Akhalsheni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T12:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T12:50:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":69.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":74.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":78.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":80.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":82.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.25,"local_amount":67.6,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":69.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613793},{"amount":43.49,"local_amount":69.58,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":71.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857505},{"amount":44.75,"local_amount":71.61,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":73.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134155},{"amount":46.3,"local_amount":74.07,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":76.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107740},{"amount":47.41,"local_amount":75.86,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":78.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255276},{"amount":48.94,"local_amount":78.31,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":80.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019410},{"amount":50.24,"local_amount":80.37,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":82.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670529},{"amount":51.62,"local_amount":82.6,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":85.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141165}],"funded_date":"2013-06-29T19:52:00Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:31:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":577834,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia esta estudiando la carrera de enfermer\u00eda, cuenta que le gusta mucho lo que est\u00e1 estudiando ya que siempre quiso ayudar a las personas, y sabe que con su carrera podr\u00e1 hacerlo.\nLa inspira su familia, ya que siempre la han apoyado y han estado a su lado para darle todo lo que necesita.

David's family owns a plot of land and cultivates grain and vegetables to harvest and sell at the local market. His sons earn small monthly salaries: Mamunka works as a security guard and Rostom works as an administrator at a local restaurant. David has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start-up a  family business without any success. His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nDavid is requesting a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He will use his loan to purchase a minibus to start a transportation business. His loan has been approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo that envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. His new business, financed with his Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase his family's income. David will use part of the profit from his loan to expand his agriculture business to improve his family's living conditions and ensure a better life for his family. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1377957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a minibus","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Khelvachauri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":170.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":176.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":177.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":183.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":184.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":188.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":198.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":195.69},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":201.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":203.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":209.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":211.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":215.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":221.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":224.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":229.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":233.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":237.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":244.59},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":252.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":257.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.07},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":577827,"name":"Nohemy Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nohemy de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, es una persona que siempre ha trabajado muy fuerte, para sacar adelante a sus hijos y ayudar a su pap\u00e1.

She is a single mother to her own two children and to another she is raising (ages 21, 16, and 8). She has worked in her community from a very young age, washing and ironing, and also selling various products. She did not have her own business; she would just be paid for sales here and there or for doing chores. One day, there was an improvement project for one of the streets in her neighbourhood and people came to her to buy tortillas to eat. This is how she started her own business five years ago already. It provides her with an income. She now sells to people in the community, and it is a profitable business. She has two children in school; in their free time, her daughter and her youngest child help her to sell the tortillas. The other child works in the afternoons after school at a mechanic's workshop.\r\nBuying the corn and lime in the city takes her about 15 minutes on public transportation. She travels to the city every week to buy supplies so that she can keep selling tortillas in her community. A neighbour goes with her and helps her to make and sell the tortillas.\r\nThis loan, which she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, is for the purchase of basic materials (corn, lime, and firewood) for the production of tortillas. Her business is profitable and she wants to take advantage of the fact that the price of corn is reasonable at the moment.\r\nWith this loan, she will secure her tortilla production for more time. She considers it to have been profitable up until now. She has a clientele, and demand has increased bit by bit. She wants to secure her business in order to continue offering her children an education, and providing a better quality of life for her father.\r\nShe wants to support her children's studies; her eldest daughter dreams of studying nursing. Her youngest son is still in elementary school.

He lives in Senaki District with his sister and parents. His sister works at local pharmacy and gets a small monthly income which is the only source of income for their family. It is hardly enough for food and, according to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. Aleksandre has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start-up a  family business without any success. His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nAleksandre is requesting a loan from Credo to start-up family business. He will use his loan to start a used-clothing business and he plans to rent a commercial space to open his shop. Aleksandre's loan has been approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo that envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. Aleksandre's new business, financed with his Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase his family's income. As his new business is started, Aleksandre hopes to significantly improve the living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1377961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":" to start a used-clothing business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Senaki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T14:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T14:00:09Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aleksandre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.98},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.53},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":576440,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a 52-year-old married man from Lebanon who is living with his wife and three children, who are still attending school.

His wife works as a nurse at a local kindergarten. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nKoba requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Koba has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. \r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Koba will purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver. He has a rich experience of being a driver and hopes that this will be profitable for his family.

In particular, they have two pigs and 0.5 hectare of agricultural land, where maize is grown. He sells the harvested maize at local markets. Tamar works as a nurse at a local kindergarten. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nSolomon requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Solomon has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Solomon will purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver. After purchasing a car, he will be able to increase the income of his family. Part of the profit will be reinvested in the agricultural business.

She works on a winding machine, wrapping threads and yarn onto spools and reels. She has been doing this for about five years. She offers handmade threads in various colors, and she is famous in her community for providing good quality thread. She is a mother of three daughters and is trying hard to meet their needs, including food, health care, clothing, and education.

He lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, with his wife, daughter and son-in-law.

His loan requests were rejected every time because of his low income and the family's poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nVladimer works as a driver on the minibus line and gets a monthly income. His wife is a teacher at a local school. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nVladimer requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Vladimer has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Vladimer will purchase milking cows and hens. As he has a house in the Martkopi district, he has decided to begin an agricultural business there. After purchasing cows and hens, he will begin a husbandry business. In particular, he will sell dairy products and eggs. The income will be reinvested in the business, which will be expanded in the future. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

His son works as a driver at a private company. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTeimuraz requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Teimuraz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Teimuraz will open an auto car wash. As he is a well-known artisan in his village and has a good number of clients, he thinks that his new business will be profitable. The profit will be reinvested in the same business. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He was born in 1983, so he is 30 years old. He is a married man and a father to three children. Only one of them attends school. He also has one dependent who is an orphan.\r\n\r\nAlex completed the basic level (primary level) of school and dropped out due financial problems since he grew up in a bigger family of more than 10 children. So, with that hardship, he then decided to begin a business.\r\n\r\nHis main business is coffee trade, but he also has additional income from boda-boda driving (providing transportation services to passengers). He has been in this business since 2006.\r\n\r\nHe therefore needed financial assistance to boost his business and achieve his dream of stabilizing his business and educating his children. This led him to access UGAFODE Microfinance Limited (MDI) services, which have taken him to a greater level. His main challenge is competition from other coffee traders and that\u2019s why he has to improve his production so as to out-compete them.\r\n\r\nHe describes himself as hardworking and honest, and therefore, he can be trusted with the organization's

The group is represented by Helam who, by profession, is a tailor in the village. She is pictured in the photograph with her right hand raised. Helam is married and blessed with two sons and her husband provides satellite television connections in the village. \r\n\r\nHelam had once started a tailoring business in the past but due to some family problem, she had to close down the shop. However, the income her husband generates from the satellite TV business was not enough to provide for all the family's expenses. So, she decided to start tailoring in the village once again, and though she did not get a huge amount of profit, she said that she is able to save some for her sons' schooling expenses and other monthly family expenses. \r\n\r\nShe started the tailoring business in 2011, and she said that she is able to save some from her daily and monthly income. At the same time, she also weaves shawls and other women's traditional wrap-around garments for sale. She has also purchased lots of household items for the house and her husband has also purchased more cable wire for expanding his satellite television business. He wants to expand to the interior of the village and also in the neighbouring villages.

She uses the loans for additional capital for her variety store. She has operated this business for five years now. The loans have helped her business and also with her household expenditures. Aside from her variety store, she also has a computer shop. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 51,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better, resulting in more profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and meet her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nCherryl hopes that her businesses will continue to be successful and she dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1113459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital. With this loan, her first through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she will buy children's clothing, toiletry items, and lingerie. The loan will be her credit base to buy merchandise with while she collects outstanding payments from her customers. She will make this loan a good investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1379211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy children's clothing, toiletry items and lingerie.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T19:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T19:10:05Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69785},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76079},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78361},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80712},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83133},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85627},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88196},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90842},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93567},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96374},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99265},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108059}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.55,"local_amount":69785,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":70935.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968365},{"amount":39.85,"local_amount":76079,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":77332.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817543},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":159073,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-25T09:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":161694.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083049},{"amount":100.55,"local_amount":191968,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":195131.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140181},{"amount":289.72,"local_amount":553095,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":562210.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490834073}],"funded_date":"2013-07-27T23:34:53Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:11:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":576822,"name":"Vince","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vince lives in Cilegon, about two hours from Jakarta.

From a very young age, she has been selling informally for a living. She married very young and as a result of that situation, she\u2019s had to work to cover the household expenses. She has always engaged in activities like selling food and selling products by catalog. She lives with her three children and is a single mother who has struggled to get her children ahead. Her oldest daughter has graduated from high school and she is the one who helps with the housework.\r\n\r\nThe selling is done on an intermittent basis or whenever she is requested for food preparation. She visits the city to buy all the supplies and to be prepared to meet the needs.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to lay flooring in her home. Currently, it is just cement, but she wants to lay a tile floor seeing as she plans to set up a small pi\u00f1ata shop there. She is familiar with this type of business, but for lack of a suitable place, she has not been able to set it up.\r\n\r\nAfter remodeling her home, she will set up the business that she has always planned to have and with it offer a rare service, although it has demand from the community. She has always been looking at how to slowly improve her home and make it more and more beautiful. \r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the main objective of the loan is to improve her home, by getting her business up and running, she will earn more income. She will also be providing a productive activity for her daughter, who will be her right-hand person in implementing this business.\r\n\r\nWhen asking her about the plans she has for the future, she said she has always dreamed of having her own business and run it with her family.

","en":"Alijon lives in the village of Adolat, in the Guliston district of Vahdat.  He is 36 years old, married, and has three children.  He has a degree in teaching and he teaches in the village school.  At the present, Alijon would like to start a new business in order to improve his family's living conditions.  He is interested in the poultry business but, more precisely, in raising chickens.  He has already built a chicken coop in his yard and he has 500 TJS in start-up capital.

With the loan funds and her own savings, she wants to buy a computerized sewing machine and fabric.  She plans to embroider 40 dresses per month on average.  This includes both every-day dresses and dresses with beautiful embroidery of varied designs.  Of course all of her friends and family know about her skills and they will be her first clients.

Irene has been with this communal bank group since its beginning and is currently the group's treasurer. She likes this group because the members are very close. Irene works in a public institution as well as in her own small business. She sells all kinds of clothing and Avon products (cosmetics, perfumes, women's accessories, and beauty products). Irene sells products in her workplace as well as from a small shop she runs from her home. While Irene is working, she hires another person to tend to her store and pays them monthly for their work. Irene allows her customers to buy products on credit and she collects payments every two days.

school.  She has been a food vendor for two years now.  She works from 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. daily and is able to make a small monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Naima's second loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.

He lives in the Martvili District with his wife, son and mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Levan requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, whose milk is used to make cheese products. Besides that, they have 100 nut trees and 0.3 hectare of agricultural land where maize is grown. They sell cheese, nuts and maize locally at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLevan requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Levan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Levan will begin trading in cement. He will purchase a big stock of cement and then resell at a higher price. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1378692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to begin trade with cement","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Martvili","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-29T21:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-29T21:50:13Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Levan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.71},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":112.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":115.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":122.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":124.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":127.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":129.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":132.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":136.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":143.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":146.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.27},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":576886,"name":"Waheeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Waheeda, 38, is the responsible mother of 3 children.
