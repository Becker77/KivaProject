This is 35-year-old Consolata Sukai from Masvingo. She is a single parent with two children and both are attending school.  \r\n\r\nConsolata runs a food business selling beef, sausages, pork and fish. The business has been in operation for 5 years.

The loan will be used to purchase more items such as milk, soup and bread for the store to sell. This will help Susan to generate greater profits and boost her business. Susan hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a bicycle. \r\n\r\nSusan is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

\n\n","en":"The woman, who is the guardian of her house hearth and support for her children, has a grand idea to organize a new business.  Barno has been living very poorly for many years because her husband is a migrant worker and has a small salary, and cannot provide his two children with all the necessities.  The children require more comforts year-after-year because they develop with the developing world.  Barno decided to organize a business of sewing curtains.  She searched for help for a long time and finally learned about the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association for Business Women.  She participated in this course and obtained a lot of positives for herself.  She obtained a certificate upon completing the course.

The majority of residents are farmers growing rice, palm oil and cassava. \r\n\r\nMessie has a cook shop business, where she has sold rice and soup for the past two years. She works from 7 am to 5 pm each day at her business. \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge in the business is her small amount of capital. She intends to use the loan to buy more fish, oil, rice, pepper, vita, onions, etc. for her business. She started her business by selling for her mother. She likes her business because she gets money from her business for her personal use. She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for their

Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNatia runs a pharmacy in her village. This is the only source of income for her family. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNatia requested a loan from Credo to startup a family business. Natia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Natia will purchase a stock of additional products such as hygiene items and baby food. As the pharmacy is expanded, the income is increased. Part of the profit will be reinvested in the same business. With another part, she will be able to provide wellbeing for her family members. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nMarivic hopes that her store will be a grocery store and she dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance

The majority of the residents are farmers growing rice, palm oil and cassava. \r\n\r\nLisa has a cook shop and has sold rice and soup for the past two years. She works 9 hours per day at her business. Her greatest challenge in the business is low income. She intends to use the loan to buy more ingredients, such as pepper, fish, meat, onions, vita, etc. She started her business by selling soap for her mother. She likes her business because she gets money from her business for her personal use.

She is a founding member of the Vegaspamba communal bank. She likes this type of loans because they give her the opportunity to grow her business and spend time with her friends and neighbors at the same time.\r\n\r\nRosa Balvina, 62, is a widow. She has six children from her marriage. They are adults who are married and live independently. She lives with her grandson, whom she has raised since he was a baby. He is now 14 and is studying in a secondary school in the town. She does not have her own house, so she lives in a house which belongs to someone else.\r\n\r\nRosa Balvina raises lambs, chickens, and calves. She also works in agriculture to feed her household, and if there is extra, she sells it. She still has not given up the work which she learned from her parents, which is making rope.\r\n\r\nShe will invest this loan in the purchase of animal feed and nylon to make rope.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to continue growing her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":1380181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The majority of residents are farmers growing rice, palm oil and cassava. \r\n\r\nFor the past seven years, Quita has had a table business which sells rice and bread.  She works 12 hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is fewer goods. She intends to use the loan to buy more rice and bread to resell. She started her business by selling for her friends.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.

She started to develop herself in this business at the age of 15, when she and a friend did manicures and pedicures and she started to earn her own income.

His loan requests have always been rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nShalva is a shoe tailor. He works at the local sewing studio for a small monthly salary. Mamuka is trying to work as hard as he can but his small salary is the only income for the family and it is rarely enough for food for them.\r\n\r\nShalva requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Shalva has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Shalva will purchase raw materials to sew shoes. He wants to use his free time after work to start sewing shoes himself from his house fpr private orders. As he will not be dependent only on a salary, Shalva will earn a good profit. Part of the profit will be used to cover the family expenses and another part to reinvest in the same field. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She is pictured with her hand raised. The sudden demise of her father shocked her mother for a long time, which left her with no other option but to take care of her mother and brother. She had been running errands for a pharmacy shop in the town market since her childhood days, from where she learned how to maneuver a drug shop. The owner of the drug shop usually taught her and says \u201cyou can run one as well\u201d and she was very confident about it. The owner of the drug shop operates with a license and her B.Pharm Degree. It has been more than a couple of years since she has been running a drug shop in the town market.\r\n\r\nKimneichong runs a drug shop at the center of the town market. The town is about 40 kms away from the capital town of Imphal. She runs the drug shop with the assistance of the doctors posted in the District Health Centre. The nurses in the town and the villages also suggest the drugs that are most often required.  She initially started the business on her own but after her marriage, her husband has been giving a hand. She gets the drug supplies from the main town and sells them in the town market. Sometime her husband runs errands for Kimneichong. She profits a good amount from the drug shop because there are very few drug shops in the whole area. She wanted to run the drug shop with an abundant supply of drugs but usually ends up with a shortage of supplies. The insufficient capital is always the main reason for the shortage of stocks in the drug shop.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Kimneichong will refill the drug store and will earn more money. In the future, she will employ a trained nurse to give first aid services to the town and the nearby villages. She wants to make her living by selling life-saving drugs and provide the town with first aid medical services. The government-run district hospitals are defunct t due to the absence of staff, which leaves the town with no other options but to go to the city. She also plans to purchase a used minivan in the future and use it for public transport between the town and the main city.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in selling export garments from neighboring states, weaving, running a piggery and running a Paan shop. Kimneichong says her gratitude towards Kiva and WSDS is not justified by words. The contribution is appreciated by all the group members and they will always remain obliged. She says \u201cThank You Kiva.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1376727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To restock her pharmacy with more drugs and first aid supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#PowerfulStory"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kimneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaithem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneiching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boishi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":95000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-01T07:57:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":577034,"name":"Malvina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Malvina is 21 years old.

She works ten hours a day at her business. She takes a taxi most of the time to buy her tailoring materials. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is that she has small capital on hand.  She did not go to grade school but she attended a tailor vocational school. Her husband sells gas. She has three children between one and fifteen years old. Only two live at home and are currently in school.  \r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from the loan she wants to buy tailoring materials such as cloth and zippers and to build good shop for her business.  She describes herself as a hardworking woman. She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house. She is proud of her business because she gets money every day for her home expense.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

She describes herself as hardworking.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Gbarnga, the capital City of Bong County. Bong is located in the centre of the country and is an agricultural hub.  The majority of residents are farmers growing rice, palm oil and cassava. \r\n\r\nTunapu has sold dried fish and soap for the past five years.  She works from 7am to 5pm each day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is having little capital. She intends to use the loan to buy more soap and fish for her business. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she gets money from her business for other uses.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to thank Kiva lenders in advance for their

Gbarnga is located in the centre of Liberia, in Bong County. The majority of people in the area are employed as farmers, cultivating crops such as rice, palm oil and cassava.\r\n \r\nMamie has a table business, where she has been selling red oil and pepper for the past six years.  She works 10 hours a day at her business.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is too few goods on her table.  She was not fortunate enough to go to school, herself, but her five-year-old child is in school. Her child lives at home.\r\n  \r\nWith the proceeds from the loan, she wants to buy more red oil and pepper to resell.  She describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house. She is proud of her business, because she earns money every day from her business. She wants to say thanks, to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

Additionally, she wishes to settle her current loan.  Her greatest dream is to grow her business, to have a larger location or to make structural improvements to her house, and to have her own place.  In this way she will be able to save expenses that she can later use to support her family and improve their quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1380223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy an assortment of inventory (liquor, beer, and household products) and to pay off a loan.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Envigado","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T04:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T04:10:06Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Amparo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90120},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92581},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95109},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97707},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100375},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103116},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105932},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108825},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111797},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114850},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117986},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121208},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124518},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127919},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131412},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135001},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138688},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142475},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146366},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150363},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154469},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158688},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163021},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167474}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":577064,"name":"Kadiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kadiatu is 45 years old and married with six children between the ages of 8 and 20.

The majority of people living there are employed as farmers, cultivating crops such as rice, palm oil and cassava. Macabah's husband is a driver and they have six children aged between nineteen and eight years old, only five of whom still live at home and are in school.  \r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Macabah has had a shop that sells milk. She works 10 hours a day and most of the time she uses taxis to go buy her goods. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is that she does not have enough capital. She did not go to grade school but she is good at managing her business, which she started using money from her mother.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from the loan, Macabah wants to buy more milk for her business. She describes herself as a hardworking woman and she is proud of her business because she gets money every day for her daily expenses. In the future, she wants to own a house. \r\n\r\nMacabah wants to say thank you to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

Record-keeping is essential. Loan is issued for small-scale farmers.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked, \u201cHow will this loan benefit (your) family?\u201d, Timothy replied, \u201cIncreased income.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Timothy owns a cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile.  Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

Carmen, invertir\u00e1 los S\/.300 soles en la compra de ovejas, para aumentar su ganado\n","en":"Carmen is 46 years old. She is a humble woman. She lives with her husband  Juvenal and their 5 children. She cares for them in a house she bought 20 years ago. Carmen works with livestock. She lives in an area with rich vegetation and for years her parents taught her the best practices for raising livestock and producing milk. Right now, this is her main economic activity. She owns 5 cows and 14 sheep that she cares for with a lot of hard work and dedication. She makes cheese every day with the milk they produce. Now she wants to continue improving her animals, because her secret is feeding them with natural grass and feed concentrate, deworming them and checking to see if they have good milk production. This is her fourth loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support she is receiving to get ahead. That is why she is committed to making her payments on time. Carmen will invest the   S\/.300 soles in buying sheep, to increase her livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1380594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep.

Despite the unreliable rainfall, bees in the region have two excellent sources of food, from wild mangrove forest and local passion fruit plantations. Beekeeping is relatively new to the area, but many farmers are very interested in owning hives. \r\n\r\nRegun is unmarried and has been farming for six years. He is currently growing passion fruit on his land. He is excited to start beekeeping because he likes learning about bees, and he is also happy to have a secondary income source from honey. \r\n\r\nThis is Regun's first loan, and he plans to use the money generated from his hives to help pay school fees.

I walked far everyday to Celuk, a village renowned for its silver and gold jewelry where I began to acquire the elements of my craft.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to all of you for your support and for offering me this microcredit, which will make it easier for me to purchase the materials I need. I wish to promote my collections so that many more people can see them, and hopefully my sales will increase over last year. If that happens, it will really help us here. Thanks and God bless you.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Komang's handcrafted jewelry on the NOVICA site:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/3065"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1379245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase silver and gemstones to increase production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T13:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T13:40:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Komang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.31,"local_amount":21.31,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T16:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":21.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399904847},{"amount":67.42,"local_amount":67.42,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T17:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":67.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410186664},{"amount":108.16,"local_amount":108.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T19:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":108.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419949287},{"amount":310.76,"local_amount":310.76,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":310.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602097},{"amount":174,"local_amount":174,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":174,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829145},{"amount":68.35,"local_amount":68.35,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":68.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449718781}],"funded_date":"2013-07-01T10:05:00Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:43:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neil Garvin","image":835015}},{"id":577208,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John lives in a small town in Kwale County.

Many farmers in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.  \r\n\r\nJohn is married and has two children. His wife currently works in tailoring, and John farms their land and engages in some business, including selling pineapples he grows and rearing dairy goats. He is very excited to start beekeeping, as the bees will facilitate crop pollination, improving production.\r\n\r\nThis is John's first loan, and he plans to use the income generated from his beehives to make some improvements to the house where he keeps his dairy goats.

Sarah runs a palm oil business, selling items such as palm oil, paper and okra. She has been running this business for two years. She works at the business ten hours per day and seven days per week. Sarah says that the main challenges to her business are that sometime purchasing power is very low, that she doesn\u2019t have many items on her table and that she lacks funds to expand her business. Sarah has applied for a loan in order to buy food items, including rice, onions, cooking seasonings and coconut oil . The extra income from this loan will allow her to feed her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to expand her business even more.

vases. She needs to buy copper and bronze to continue crafting her designs.\r\n\r\nAna Maria has been selling through NOVICA since 2001. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"For 24 years I have dedicated myself to metalwork in the city where I married. My husband is an able jeweler from whom I learned the art of working with silver and plaques. Today we have a small family workshop in which my children are also involved, and we work together with dedication, constantly developing new products.

Do\u00f1a Celia tomo algunos cursos para saber c\u00f3mo mejorar el cultivo de sus hongos platica un poco de como los prepara. Primero necesita una tonelada de zacate picado el mismo zacate lo remoja en agua tiene que estar bien remojado, para ver si tiene el 70% de agua lo extiende muy bien y si le sale agua es porque tiene el agua que necesita. Despu\u00e9s se junta todo como un colch\u00f3n se tapa muy bien con un pl\u00e1stico negro esta preparaci\u00f3n se deja reposar un d\u00eda completo, al tercer d\u00eda se cambia de lugar y tambi\u00e9n se tapa perfectamente, al s\u00e9ptimo d\u00eda el zacate se esteriliza a ba\u00f1o Mar\u00eda, este producto se deja en botes reposando para que al siguiente d\u00eda se pueda sembrar en las bolsas incubadoras en ellas se pone zacate estas bolsas tienen que pesar 14 kilos, se dejan reposando 15 d\u00edas, para despu\u00e9s pasarlas al invernadero este proceso se le conoce como producci\u00f3n y finalmente solo espera para que los hongos inicien a brotar de la bolsa.

She finds the kind and funny side to everything, but she is also a very hardworking person. She lives in a very developed community that is divided into blocks. The residents of the community are friendly. Most of them grow corn and others have different businesses, such as stores.  \r\n\r\nCelia is 39 years old. She has been married for 19 years to Francisco. Together they have made a family with three children. Two of them go to elementary school. Celia has grown seta mushrooms for 8 years. Celia remarked \u201cI like to grow my seta mushrooms because my mother grew mushrooms. It was a very good business, so that was how I decided to start growing seta mushrooms. Although it is a business that requires a lot of work, I like it a lot.\" This time, she is asking for a loan to buy fifty units of incubator bags to buy the mushrooms. The loan will help her buy the bags, as they are a little expensive. Celia took some courses to learn how to improve at growing mushrooms. She talked a little about how she prepares them. First, she needs a ton of chopped grass. She wets the grass in water. It has to be really wet. If it is 70% water it expands well and if water is dripping it means it has all the water it needs. She pushes it all together like a mattress and covers it really well with a black tarp. She lets this sit for an entire day. The third day she moves it and covers it well again. The seventh day the grass is sterilized with steam. The result is put into containers until the next day, when it can be put into the incubator bags. The grass in the bags has to weigh 14 kilos. They are left for 15 days and then put in a green house. This process is known as the production, and finally she just has to wait for the mushrooms to start to sprout from the bag. Then Celia has to harvest the seta mushrooms every third day to sell them. Every day, she has to get up at four in the morning to harvest them and take them freshly cut to the market to sell them in the plaza. Celia says that she already has regular customers. The business is going very well for her and she knows the process very well. The only problem she has is when the incubator bags start to get a brown color. That is bad news because no mushrooms will come out of that bag. Although this means a loss of profit and investment for Celia, it doesn't limit her because she is focused on her goal. Celia dreams of having more greenhouses and producing more mushrooms to increase her profits and help pay for the education of her three children.

Therefore, she is requesting a loan of 12,500,000 IDR from TLM. This loan will help her to buy more stock, such as sugar, rice, biscuits, cigarettes and soft drinks.

The borrower is 37-year-old Fatmata from Kandeh town Bo. She is married and has four children between the ages of 2 and 22. Her children are attending school. Fatmata runs a palm oil business, where she sells palm oil, beans and peppers. She has been running this business for two years. She works at the business ten hours per day, seven days per week. Fatmata says that the main challenges to her business are that purchasing power is sometime very low, that she doesn\u2019t have many items on her table, and that she lacks funds to expand her business. Fatmata has applied for a loan in order to buy food items, including rice, palm oil and cooking oil, for her food stand. The extra income from this loan will allow her to feed her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to expand her food stand business. She thanks you for your support! \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1379199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Massah says that the main challenge to her business is that purchasing power is sometimes very low. Massah has applied for a loan in order to buy food items, including gallon containers of palm oil and gari (cassava). The extra income from this loan will allow her to feed her children and increase her business. In the future, she hope to export her goods.

Don Apolonio tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casado desde hace tiempo con la se\u00f1ora Francisca juntos formaron una familia con seis hijos de los cuales dos a\u00fan dependen de dicha pareja y se encuentran estudiando su educaci\u00f3n primaria. \n\nDon Apolonio se dedica a la venta de fantas\u00eda y mercer\u00eda desde hace 20 a\u00f1os platica como inicio su actividad \u201cYo trabajaba como empleado en un negocio grande me gusto mucho la venta de estos art\u00edculos y fue como inicie la venta\u201d. Esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comprar m\u00e1s art\u00edculos de mercer\u00eda, fantas\u00eda y materia prima para la elaboraci\u00f3n de los accesorios que \u00e9l crea: mo\u00f1os muy llamativos y bonitos para adornar el cabello de las ni\u00f1as y jovencitas. Comenta que nunca asisti\u00f3 a un curso para aprender a elaborar los mo\u00f1os aprendi\u00f3 practicando todos los d\u00edas, su trabajo es muy bueno se esmera mucho para que los mo\u00f1os de las ni\u00f1as duren mucho tiempo. Don Apolonio vende sus art\u00edculos en los tianguis recorre todos los rincones para as\u00ed obtener un poquito m\u00e1s de ganancias. Le gusta mucho tener trato con las personas por eso se esfuerza para dar un muy buen servicio. La \u00fanica dificultad es cuando las autoridades no lo dejan vender en los tianguis; en la mayor\u00eda de los lugares en los que vende les exigen una cuota para poder trabajar. A pesar de esto, a Don Apolonio le gustar\u00eda llegar a fabricar sus art\u00edculos de fantas\u00eda y tener las herramientas necesarias pero tambi\u00e9n es necesario tomar algunos cursos para aprender a crear otros accesorios.

This community's largest festival is when they celebrate Saint Anthony on June 13. Apolonio is 45 years old. He has been married for some time to Francisca. Together they started a family with six children, of which two are still dependent on the couple and are primary school students.\r\n\r\nApolonio has sold notions and sewing items for 20 years. He says of the beginning of his work: \"I worked as an employee in a large business. I liked selling these items very much, and that was how I started the shop.\" This time he is asking for the loan to buy more sewing items, notions, and raw material for the production of the accessories he makes: very striking and pretty ribbons to adorn young girls' hair. He says that he never took a course to learn how to make the ribbons. He learned by practicing every day. His work is very good, and he takes great pains to ensure the girls' ribbons last a long time. Apolonio sells his items in the street markets and goes around to each corner in order to earn a little bit more. He likes dealing with people very much, so he makes an effort to provide very good service. The only difficulty is when the authorities don't let him sell at the street markets; in the majority of the places where he sells, they demand a fee in order to be able to work. Despite this, Apolonio likes to make his notions and to have the necessary tools, but it is also necessary to take some courses to learn to make other accessories. The group is very grateful to VisionFund and Kiva for the opportunity to receive a loan since the three of them can continue investing in their economic activities.

She has three years of primary education, but couldn't do any more as her parents could not economically support it. Her parents were the ones who taught her from a young age to work the land and grow corn, beans, and coffee above all, the latter crop being the only one that earns her family income.

woman, 63 years of age. She is a widow. She has two grown sons and one daughter. Her sons are currently outside Tajikistan; they are migrant workers in Russia. Every month their send some money to support their mother. Mahram\u2019s daughter lives separately with her husband. As to Mahram, she lives in her home together with her daughters-in-law and grandchildren. The grandchildren are growing, and  the expenditures to cover their needs are increasing too. Even though Mahram's sons send some money, this is not enough to provide for all family needs. Therefore Mahram runs her own small business. She buys and resells fruits and vegetables. Mahram gets up early in the morning and buys vegetables or fruits at the wholesale market and then resells them at the central market of their region. She puts some of the money aside and spend the rest to buy food for her family. Her two daughters-in-law do not remain idle, either: one of them sews custom-made dresses, and the other sells homemade noodles to local cafeterias. At present it is the season to make household purchases, which is why the demand for vegetables and fruits is increasing. Therefore Mahram would like to expand her stock and earn larger revenues for her family. Mahram has applied to Arvand for a loan to stock up on various vegetables and fruits. She thanks Arvand for its financial support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1380868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

They have five children, but only one of them still lives at home with them. Juli\u00e1n's line of work is ranching and agriculture. Every morning he gets up to care for his cows, who yield him many liters of milk. As he has large green areas, a lot of space, and above all, natural grasses that he planted himself, having these animals is very profitable. Also, like any good farmer, he plants a variety of feed crops on his land as well. \r\n\r\nHe now wants to improve the stock of his animals. Specifically, he wants high-quality milking cows that will produce even more liters of milk for him to sell. This is his second KIVA loan. He is thankful for the opportunity for progress that his previous loan gave him. For that reason, he promises to be punctual in his repayments, as they are what is helping him improve his business.\r\n\r\nJuli\u00e1n will invest S\/.600 soles in the purchase of organic fertilizers to feed his alfalfa plantings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1380706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"purchase organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":76.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":79.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":82.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":85.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.22,"local_amount":64.59,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":67.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997302},{"amount":25.5,"local_amount":67.99,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":70.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864764},{"amount":26.28,"local_amount":70.08,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":73.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353135},{"amount":27.57,"local_amount":73.52,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":76.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904897},{"amount":28.51,"local_amount":76.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":79.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090899},{"amount":29.81,"local_amount":79.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":82.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777501},{"amount":63.11,"local_amount":168.3,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-24T09:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":175.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598029}],"funded_date":"2013-07-01T00:26:49Z","paid_date":"2014-02-24T09:40:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":578218,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cecilia tiene 41 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada y vive en su casa propia junto su esposo y sus 3 hijos.

For that, she uses wood from different trees such as cedar, walnut, avocado, and pine. Also, over time she expanded her workshop (located behind her house), and now she also makes furniture such as tables and chairs, or simply sells the wooden boards. The business is profitable, and with all the savings obtained she was able to open another business in her home where she sells some food items.\r\n\r\n\"The crate business is profitable, because the orders they place with me are for thousands, this week I have to sell two thousand crates to only one buyer,\" she notes.

For a living, she harvests olive trees, thyme leaves, vine leaves, and many other kinds of plants. Following the harvest, she turns the olives and the leaves into edible products, sells them or conserves them as a \"Mouneh\" (food that is conserved from one season to the other). She has been working in this field for 25 years now. Her husband is a concierge, and three of her underage children work. \r\n\r\nHowever, even with five family members working, the family income is extremely low and is in no way sufficient to provide for a family of 9 individuals. Furthermore, Subhiyi did not have the opportunity as a child or even as an adult to acquire a proper education, because of her economic situation and that of her late parents.

He owns a small business where he maintains electric wares and cars. His wife is currently unemployed, which makes him the only financial resource of the family.

She is married to Marianito, a chef. Together with her husband and children, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJennifer operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. She also has a direct sales business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy greater quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, as well as frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJennifer hopes to expand her business and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1379724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken and vegetables as well as other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T19:40:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5067.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534868},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2533.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784262},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2533.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771249},{"amount":72.92,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3166.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824302},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1900.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478184}],"funded_date":"2013-07-02T23:00:01Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:48:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":577546,"name":"Letecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Letecia is 48 years old and married with four children, who are in school.

She and her partner have a son who is only a few months old.  She has four years of primary education, which she was able to get thanks to her parents' effort and support, as they had few economic resources.  They were the ones who taught her to work the land and grow corn, beans, and coffee, and this family tradition is why she has a lot of experience.

She is married and has four children between the ages of 6 and 19 years. Her children are currently attending school. In 2008, Zainab established her clothing business. She began her business because she needed to create her own source of income instead of depending on her husband alone. She works at the business 10 hours per day and seven days per week.  She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.  \r\n\r\nZainab requires a loan in order to purchase more wax cotton for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Zainab plans to open a shop.

She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and the lack of finances to expand her business.\r\n\r\nFanta requires a loan in order to purchase retail items like candles, cigarettes and biscuits to expand her business.
