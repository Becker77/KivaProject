She and her husband joined hands to work in the neighbors\u2019 banana plantations to earn a living until they managed to plant their own banana garden. That is when she got to know of Ugafode micro finance and acquired a loan of 500,000 which helped her buy another piece of land to expand their banana plantation. Unfortunately, their plantation is now affected with banana wilt disease and they are requesting a loan of 2,000,000 to buy pesticides for it.

She is married and has three children between the ages of 5 and 13 years. Her children are currently attending school. In 2008, Marie established her fish business. She began her business because she needs to create her own source of income instead of depending on her husband alone. She works at the business eight hours per day and six days per week.  She says that the main challenge to her business is transporting the fish.  It is very difficult because sometimes the vehicle breaks on the way.  \r\n\r\nMarie requires a loan in order to purchase more fish for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Marie plans to expand her business even more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1379821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

He lives in the Kutaisi district with his 32-year-old son, Shalva, and his daughter-in-law. Ramaz requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Shalva is working as a singer at the local restaurant. His wife is a cook. They both get small monthly salaries that are the only source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Ramaz will start trading in household goods and clothes. He will go to Turkey to purchase everything at wholesale prices, bring it to his district, and sell among the villagers with a price markup. Shalva will work as hard as he can to earn a good profit and provide a better life for his family. He will reinvest part of the profit into the same field to purchase more products and offer better choices to his clients. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

","en":"Surayo is an honest and respectable woman.  She lives in the Gafurov region.  She is married and has two wonderful children. They have a very friendly and happy family.  Several years ago, Surayo's oldest son left home to work in Russia because he could not find a job in his homeland.   Every month, he tries to send his parents some money.  Surayo's husband is a welder, and he makes little money.  Surayo herself raises cattle.  Her husband assists her with the purchase and sale of cattle. This business provides them with a good profit.  Surayo's son plans to return the next year and get married.  Because of this, Surayo wants to repair the home in time for his return.  Right now, she does not have enough savings to do this.

She is raising 3 children.  Her husband works in Russia, but sends home money every month for the children.  Musalam sells children's clothing, and she has a store which she leased herself at one of the markets in town.  She loves children very much, and therefore decided to sell children's clothing.  Earlier, she had her merchandise delivered by vendors, which was more expensive.  She has now decided to go and purchase the merchandise herself.  Musalam dreams that her children receive a good education and work in a professional field in the future.  She hopes that, in her old age, her children can be her support.  Because Musalam has decided to start traveling by herself to purchase merchandise, she needs the financial means to do so. She learned from her friends that she can request a loan from the Avrand organization, and has decided to submit an application.  This is her first loan from Avrand and, because of this, she is very serious about receiving a loan.  She plans to use the loan to purchase a new assortment of children's summer clothing, and expand her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1375865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy children's clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-30T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-30T23:00:04Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#PowerfulStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Musalam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":344.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":356.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":368.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":380.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":393.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":407.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":420.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":435.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":449.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":465.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":480.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":497.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.36,"local_amount":344.58,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":344.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616153},{"amount":74.82,"local_amount":356.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":356.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860024},{"amount":77.35,"local_amount":368.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":368.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136771},{"amount":79.97,"local_amount":380.83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":381.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900967},{"amount":82.69,"local_amount":393.74,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":393.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550149},{"amount":662.81,"local_amount":3156.25,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3157.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774370}],"funded_date":"2013-07-30T21:46:18Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":577633,"name":"Youngor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Youngor is 28 years old.

She is married with two children between aged two and seven years-old. One of her children is currently attending school. In 2008, Zainab established her fish business. She began her business because she wanted to be self dependent. She works at the business eight hours per day and six days per week.  She says that the main challenge to her business is transporting the fish which is very difficult because sometimes vehicles break on the way.  \r\n\r\nZainab requires a loan in order to purchase more fish for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her standard of living. In the future, Zainab plans to expand her business more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1379872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

For the past ten years she has been selling oil, rice, pepper, etc. in the local market.   She started this business with money given to her by her mother.   She enjoys her business because the business gives her more money.  She sells six days in a week from 7am to 5 pm, and most of the time she uses a taxi to get her goods to her shop. She is requesting a loan to purchase more oil, rice, pepper, etc. for her business.   She plans to build a house and educate her children.

He has been working as a taxi driver since 1974, and it was his only source of income until two of his children who are under 18 quit school to start working in order to help their father in avoiding the burden of their expenses and living needs.\r\nIn addition to their family needs and requests, two of his children are still at school.  One of them is registered in a public school and the other in a private one.

The younger son is finishing high school this year. \r\n\r\nZebi has a large house, and she would like to do some repairs, since upkeep hasn't been done in a very long time. The house is in bad condition, but to fix it will require money, and they don't have much extra since in May Zebi's husband spent money on rice planting, and the harvest will be in October. For that reason Zebi decided to request a loan to buy building materials and repair the house.

She resides in Paynesville South, a suburb just outside Monrovia. The area is one of the most populated areas in Montserrado County, with one of the best standards of living in the country. Good roads, access to clean water, affordable rents, and plentiful transportation options make Paynesville South one of the most popular places to live. \r\n\r\nCecelia is single, with two children, ages 11 and four. Her children are currently attending school and live at home. \r\n\r\nShe runs a table business, selling used clothes, such as blouses, tee-shirts, and trousers.  She describes herself as serious businesswoman. \r\n\r\nCecelia started her business two years ago, using money given to her mother. Typically, she works at her business from 7am to 4pm, Monday to Saturday, and she transports her goods to her business by bus. She cites her greatest challenge as small capital. She is proud of her business because it supports her home.\r\n\r\nUsing the proceeds of this loan, Cecelia intends to purchase more used clothes, such as blouses, jeans, trousers, and tee-shirts. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Cecelia plans to build her house and educate her children. She sincerely thanks you, in advance, for your support.

","en":"Zulfiniso is a happy mother to two wonderful children. She is divorced - unfortunately, several years ago, her husband divorced her and left her alone with two children.  It was very difficult for Zulfiniso to raise her children by herself, but she tried to do everything to become both their father and their mother, so that her children would not feel the absence of a father.  Of course, Zulfiniso herself feels lonely and abandoned, but she tries not to let her children know this.  Her children are very caring and help their mother.  Zulfiniso works in one of the restaurants in her town. She is a cook, and prepares very delicious and exceptional dishes.

","en":"Gulandom is a married woman who has three children. She is a vendor who sells vegetables and fruits. She has a small stall near her home where she sells vegetables and fruits.  She has engaged in this trade for several years now. Her husband also works. Gulandom is a very diligent woman, who is prepared to work seven days a week for her children.  In the morning, she goes to the market, purchases fresh fruits and vegetables, and sells them until evening.  Earlier, her daughter used to help her, but she got married and her husband sometimes helps after work. Recently, her son became ill, and his treatment and medication require a certain amount of money.  Therefore, she and her husband have decided to take out a loan.  They also want to remodel their home a little.  Because of this, they want to spend a portion of the loan on their son's treatment, and use the rest to purchase building materials in order to repair their apartment, because it has been a long time since they have repaired it. Gulandom thanks Avrand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1378113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She is 36 years old. She dropped out of school and got married at the age of 18. At the age of 25 with three children, she divorced because her husband was mistreating her. She started up the small business of selling secondhand clothes in order to take care of her children. This business has grown and helped her to sustain her family as well as her extended family. She has been able to pay tuition for her young sisters.

Ten years ago she began her business with the little capital that she was loaned, and with the goal to have her own grocery store business where she offered general goods that would generate income to help her husband with the household expenses.  Little by little it has grown and she has stocked it with an inventory of products that help attract her customers.\r\n\r\nThis Se\u00f1ora is very hard-working because at five in the morning she begins her work; preparing her son for school and later tending to the business as well as all the household chores.

area in Totonicapan, Guatemala. It was formed three years ago and has provided valuable opportunities for the ten women to access loans and education through Friendship Bridge. The women were able to either start, maintain or grow various businesses such as animal husbandry, retail sales (snacks, typical clothing) or weaving. In this way, they generate income to support their families.\r\n\r\nTwo of the members of the Trust Bank are new and one of them is 41-year-old Eufemia. She is widowed with four children. Before her husband died four years ago, Eufemia depended on him to provide financial support for the family. After his death, she needed to find a way to support herself and her children, two of whom are in school. She began to raise chickens and soon realized that her business could prosper with more investment. Eufemia learned of Friendship Bridge, attended meetings and requested her first loan! Currently, she has one dozen chickens that she sells in the local market. With her loan, Eufemia intends to purchase three dozen additional chickens as well as feed to fatten them. This industrious woman also is involved with textile design which is an additional way for her to generate income.\r\n\r\nEufemia is very confident that her business will prosper. She tells us that she feels blessed and happy with the opportunity to be a part of \u201cMujeres de Chuanoj\u201d. In her own words, \"It is not easy being a mother and father at the same time. As mothers, our children are our first priorities and we need to do everything possible to support and provide for them. This loan will greatly benefit my business and my family.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":1380132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He would like to invest in materials for his hand-carved African masks and purchase tools for his workshop.\r\n\r\nAbdul has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I always knew I wanted to paint, but wasn't sure I could make a living out of it, so I looked into other fields too. I observed a master carver at his workshop for a period of time, then I picked up a log of wood and started carving out a mask as I had observed him doing. This surprised him and he was willing to help me perfect the skill.

Buchanan is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish. Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n\r\nKumba went to school, stopping in 6th grade. She is married and she has two children, both age 10, who are in school and live at home. She describes herself as a hardworking woman.\r\n\r\nKumba has a table business selling palm oil. She has been in business for ten years and works 10 hours each day at the business. She transports her goods by taxi. One of the greatest challenges that Kumba faces is low income, so, with this loan, she will buy palm oil for her business.\r\n\r\nShe started her business with money from her husband. Kumba is proud of her business because of the profits she makes. Her future plan is to build a house. She thanks you in advanced for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1379995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married and has two children, ages 6 and 4. In 2007, she established her meat shop business. Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW. She used her most recent loan to buy buffalo for her business. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Nitu plans to uplift the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn Nepal, the meat is always fresh. In small stalls along busy roads, open-air butcher shops sell chicken, goat and water buffalo by the kilo.

Most of the inhabitants of this village are tribal. In the year 2010, six active women entrepreneurs in this village formed a group named Basudev to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing businesses. Mamata is one of them. The lady standing third from right, touching the flour-milling machine, is Mamata. She is an energetic lady of 30 years who lives with her husband, one son who is nine years old and one daughter who is 13 years old. Both her children are continuing their primary education in the village school. \r\n\r\nMamata has been running a wheat flour milling business in her village with a single machine for the last five years. Her husband is helping her in this business. She earns a daily net income of 400 INR from the existing businesses. Out of this income, she has been able to manage her household expenses in a decent manner. So Mamata is planning to increase her income by expanding the business. Looking into the demand of the locality, with the present loan, Mamata wants to put another two units of machine in her center. One is for processing flattened rice and another is for wheat flour. She is convinced that this will generate a handsome income for her. Mamata hopes to save enough money to provide a better education for her children and construct another hall for the new machines.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Sabutri and Sushila who have a general store business, Laxmi who has a Tiffin center with a fast food center, Gayatree who has a tailoring center and Pausa who has a barber shop businesses, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1380071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase machinery for flattened rice and wheat flour milling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"DAKULUGUDA, RAYAGADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":2975,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabutri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gayatree","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pausa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":176000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":176000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T21:36:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":577920,"name":"Robila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robila is a 26-year-old married woman.

Sandhyarani is one of the members of this group, standing second from the left with her hand raised. She is 31 years of age and lives in a rented house with her husband and two sons who are nine and seven years old. Ten years ago, Sandhyarani\u2019s husband migrated to this place from the coastal belt and worked in a barber shop as a daily wage earner for three years. In the year 2007, Sandhyarani started a one-seat barber shop of her own in a low profile with the help of her husband. In the subsequent years, with three consecutive loans from Mahashakti Foundation, she developed her shop into three seats by taking a rented cabin in the heart of the town. She has engaged two male workers for giving service to the customers. She earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR from her barber shop, which is not at all sufficient to manage the household expenses, the education expenses of her children and the regular expenses for the business. As she is an outsider to this place, she doesn\u2019t have her own house to live. Therefore, Sandhyarani want to increase her income by adding some extra facility to the existing business for generating the minimum necessities of her family. This is the fourth loan of Sandhyarani and she wants to purchase a facial machine, a massage machine and two big mirrors. She also wants to repair the existing moving chairs. From this investment, she expects a good return for the total development of her family. With the extra income, Sandhyarani hopes to purchase a plot of land and construct a house for her family. She also dreams of giving a better education to her children. The other three members of this group are Janaki, Pusbabai and Satyabhama who are running a betel nut shop with a tailoring center, vending vegetables and running a tea stall with biscuits and snacks, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1380073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber Shop","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a facial machine, massage machine and two big mirrors","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janaki ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandhyarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pusbabai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satyabhama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":128000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":128000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T13:51:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":577921,"name":"Fred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fred is a 39-year-old married man with four children living in Masindi, Uganda.

She lives in a two-room apartment in Bamenda in the Northwest Region of Cameroon. She has faced some difficulties in life, including sickness and the loss of family members such as her father and mother. Poverty in the general family has also been a problem, and starting up a business was not possible.\r\n\r\nShe plans to buy two-week-old fowls, as well as feed and the necessary vaccine for the fowls. Part of the loan will be invested in buying provision items such as tinned tomatoes, Maggi, oil, and rice. She believes that her business will succeed because she has been selling and keeping fowls for a long time. The high demand for fowls and manure in the community is another reason for the success of her business. The community will benefit from the supply of fowls, and the manure will also be sold to the public. They will not have to go a long distance to buy provision items. \r\n\r\nThe profits will help her improve the housing conditions of the family and provide better education and health for her and her only child. She will also expand her business. She prefers GHAPE because of the convenient repayment period, low interest, and the social education they

His brother works as a waiter at a restaurant and his mother currently stays at home looking after his youngest brother. Before his full-time job, Byambadonid had been working with his mother by renting a small workshop near their home and providing computer repair services to local people. Now, he is requesting a loan of 4000000 MNT to open a grocery store as an additional income source. The loan will be used to pay for rent, working capital, and building materials. In addition to purchasing food products in large quantities, he will rent a building appropriate for running a grocery store and will renovate it with bricks and cement.  As a result, he will be able to generate more income for his family and improve their standard of living. The borrower is a very hard-working individual who strives for a better future.
