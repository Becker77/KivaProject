She has always made her own clothes. She decided that she would create an additional business to generate income. Josefa began to raise animals and currently has seven goats and fifty chickens. She realized that she needed a lot more funds to properly feed her animals and approached Friendship Bridge for a loan of USD 640. Josefa also would like to purchase two dozen additional chickens. With any remaining funds, she will buy more thread for her weaving business.\r\n\r\nJosefa is quite proud of her achievements and tells us with a smile, \"My opportunities were few when I was younger. Today, I realize that a loan can be most beneficial if we know how to manage it.

hijos, a quienes ama y son su principal raz\u00f3n en la vida, ella es una persona muy amable, trabajadora y entusiasta, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por sacar adelante a su familia, ya que ella siempre ha sido padre y madre para sus hijos; lamentablemente por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos y por la necesidad que tuvo de trabajar desde muy joven, Yanet no pudo estudiar una carrera profesional, en sus ratos libres le gusta pasear por la orilla de un lago cercano a su hogar y en algunas ocasiones cocina un riqu\u00edsimo Lomo Saltado para compartir con su familia. \nPor iniciativa propia, con mucho empe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n, Yanet trabaja en su peque\u00f1o negocio de venta de comida, ella vende frituras como alitas broaster, salchipapas y otros, ella trabaja todos los d\u00edas por un aproximado de 10 horas y cree que le va bien por su buena saz\u00f3n y por el trato amable que brinda a los dem\u00e1s.\nYanet se encuentra muy agradecida con los prestamistas Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada podr\u00e1 realizar el mejoramiento de su vivienda, ya que desea comprar materiales de construcci\u00f3n para refaccionar el techado y ponerle

reason for living.  She\u2019s a very kind, hardworking, enthusiastic person who focuses all her efforts into moving her family forward since she\u2019s always been both father and mother to her children.  Sadly, for lack of economic resources and the need to start work at a very young age, Yanet was unable to study a professional career.  In her free time she enjoys walking along the shores of a lake near her home and sometimes cooks a delicious Lomo Saltado [strips of sirloin marinated in vinegar, soy sauce and spices, then stir fried with red onions, parsley and tomatoes] to share with her family. \r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with much effort and dedication, Yanet works in her small business selling food.  She sells fried snacks like Broaster-style chicken wings, \u2018salchipapas\u2018 [fried sausages with fried potatoes] and others.  She works every day for about 10 hours and thinks she does well because of her tasty cooking and the kind way she treats others.\r\n\r\nYanet is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support provided she will be able to make some home improvements because she needs to buy building supplies to repair the roof and to install a concrete floor in her children\u2019s bedroom.  In this way, Yanet will be able to offer greater security and well-being for her family and she can continue working and striving to reach her great dream: to see her children become great professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1376248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to make some home improvements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yanet Azucena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":131.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":141},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":144.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":149.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":157.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":161.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":169.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":174.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":181.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":195.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":203.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.01,"local_amount":272.02,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":279.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776296},{"amount":54.04,"local_amount":144.1,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":148.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054516},{"amount":115.15,"local_amount":307.07,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":315.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819420},{"amount":60.62,"local_amount":161.65,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":166.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472371},{"amount":418.18,"local_amount":1115.16,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694857}],"funded_date":"2013-07-29T15:28:07Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":578292,"name":"Elisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elisa viene de una familia muy trabajadora, que siempre se esfuerzan por salir adelante y crecer.

She hopes that with the anticipated profits, she will purchase an auto rickshaw for her son so that he can generate income, too. Rubina is feeling very happy and thankful to Kiva lenders.

The members live in Meru, near Mt. Kenya in Eastern Kenya.  The region is very productive for dairy farming due to the favorable weather conditions.  Most families in the region have between two and ten cows, and therefore the sale of milk becomes their main source of income, alongside potato farming.\n\nThe women of Kairuni are very hardworking and take care of their families from the little income they get.  However, they are highly challenged when it comes to getting fuel for cooking.  Their homes are not connected to the electricity grid, and purchasing LPG gas is too expensive for them.  They therefore use firewood, charcoal, and kerosene for cooking and lighting.  It costs between $25 and $58 US to purchase charcoal and kerosene each month, and firewood from the nearby forests is highly guarded and restricted to ensure conservation, so getting firewood is also a challenge.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, VEP taught them that they could install biodigesters and use cleaner, better fuel that is also efficient without incurring on-going costs.  To enable them to undertake this project, they have all benefited from this loan and construction has been initiated.  With a biodigester, they will have increased savings that enable them to repay the loan and improve their lives.  They can also spend more time with their families in place of the time previously spent collecting firewood.  Bioslurry from the biodigester will also come in handy to replace commercial fertilizers in potato farming, hence increasing production and ensuring food security.\n\nThe group is usually represented by Madam Amaria who is seated second from the left. She is the group chair and the most educated. She is also the one who motivates and urges the group to embrace change. with her leadership the group will grow through many other projects as well.\n\n

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTamara would like to start up a family dairy farm business. She has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up purposes, but without success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nShe has now requested a loan from Credo to start up the family business. She has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products because they are perceived as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tamara will purchase a milking cow. Once the milking cow is purchased, Tamara will produce dairy products to offer for sale. In an effort to earn additional income, she will also purchase clothing items to offer for sale. These investments will increase the income of her family. \r\n\r\nTamara's new business initiatives, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the

In particular, they have a 0.8 hectare of agricultural land, where potatoes, maize and cucumbers are grown. They sell the harvested products at local markets at a good price. In addition, his wife trades in clothing. It is hardly enough to feed the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRapig requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Rapig will purchase milking cows. He plans to start a husbandry business. They will start producing dairy products to sell. This will increase the income of their family. With the increased income they will expand the dairy farm in the future.

Since its initiation in the year 2012, the group members have saved together to buy water tanks for their families. They have been using the merry-go-round system, though, so only 10 of them have received the water tanks as they are only able to buy one tank per month. Their problem is not only water. Since most of them cannot afford to install electricity in their homes, they are forced to buy kerosene for lighting and firewood for cooking. Having partnered with Visionary Empowerment Programme, they have learned that they can benefit from a more affordable credit scheme to enable them to access quality renewable energy products.\n\nAs a result, they have all benefited from a loan to purchase a solar package for their home and an efficient cookstove. The solar package will enable them charge their mobile phones and use a small radio as well as save them from  buying  kerosene again. The efficient cookstove will save them at least 50% of the firewood they had been using with traditional cookstoves, therefore easing the burden of collecting firewood daily. The cookstove also reduces smoke emission and will be better for their health.\n\nSince they are all farmers, proceeds from their farming businesses and the little they save by not buying kerosene will enable them pay the loan. Thanks to green energy technologies, more homes can enjoy improved lives.\n\nJohn and Simon, standing 3rd from left and 2nd from right respectively, are brothers in law. John is the group chair and Simon is the coordinator, positions they earned as they pioneered the group formation. They, like the rest of the group members, wish to get empowered through renewable energy products that save them money and create a better environment for their families. Their future plan is to supply the lamps to their neighbors as a business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1377316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

Her parents are very hopeful for Agustina, so when she finishes college later, she could help fund their schooling. \r\n\r\nAgustina is very grateful to Kiva investors who help finance her studies.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1371702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay education fees for three years.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"CILACAP","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":253,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T19:40:04Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-02T08:42:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":577974,"name":"Noemi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noemi, a 30-year-old married mother of three children, two of whom are in school, raises and fattens pigs in the Philippines.

children. The children are 12 and 13 years old. Vakhtang requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe family owns a milk cow. They milk the cow every day, and they produce dairy products. The products are sold at the local markets. The family has some additional income, in the form of monthly remittances from Vakhtang\u2019s mother, who is working abroad. The family's total income is so small, that it is rarely enough to provide food for them.\r\n\r\nVakhtang requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Vakhtang will purchase a car. He will drive the car as a taxi. Vakhtang is a very hardworking man. He will work long hours, to earn a good profit and increase the family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will give Vakhtang an opportunity to improve the living conditions of his family. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1380316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To purchase a car, for use as a taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gamarjveba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T19:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T19:50:07Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vakhtang ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":214.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":220.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":222.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":228.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":230.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":234.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":244.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":242.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":248.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":251.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":257.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":260.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":265.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":270.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":274.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":279.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":284.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":289.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":294.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.02},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":274.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":284.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":577976,"name":"Seraphine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seraphine is 36 years old.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLali requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Lali has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Lali will purchase a car.

His hometown is situated in Simanjiro, South of Mount Kilimanjaro. Like many men of his tribe, he moved to the big city Dar es Salaam to try his luck as a security guard. For his job he earns about 100 USD per month. Despite this bad income, there was something good about the job: during the time he got in contact with many English speaking people and that's why he is (apart from Maasai language and Swahili) also fluent in English.\n\nHowever, \"a real Maasai doesn't belong to big cities like this,\" Micah says, and it is clear that he wants to go back to Simanjiro, even though he has some concerns about home. One of these big concerns in Micah's home village is lack of electricity: people need to light up their houses with kerosene lamps, which are very unhealthy and also really expensive. \n\nTherefore, Micah wants to start his own social business and bring affordable solar energy to his family members and friends. African Solar Rise helped him to write a business plan and provided him with technical training as well as sales training.\n\nWith a loan we do not only empower Micah to start his own social business; we also reach all of his family members (and Maasai normally have big families!) and provide them with renewable, clean, and sustainable energy.\n\nBecause of his good reputation as a guard and our personal experiences with him during our training sessions, where he showed some admirable entrepreneurial capabilities, we are confident that the loan will be fully repaid after a little more than one year. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4200,"image":{"id":1381275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy

Ergashoy\u2019s dream has always been for her son to receive an education and become a professional. But for the time being, due to lack of finances in the family, he was forced to go to Russia as a migrant worker. He receives a good salary and tries to send some money to his parents every month. Ergashoy herself does not remain idle, either: she is a seamstress working out of her home. She sews traditional national outfits, blankets etc. She also receives a decent income from this work. Ergashoy\u2019s husband works as an engineering technician at a car park and earns very little, but this income too supplements the family budget. All of their income is spent on everyday needs. Yet they dream of renovating the house they live in. The house\u2019s condition is unfavorable. Due to frequent rains, the roof is badly worn out and leaks during rain. This is why Ergashoy and her husband decided to renovate their house. And so Ergashoy has applied to Arvand in order to receive a loan to buy construction material and renovate her home. She thanks Arvand in advance for its support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1378799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T20:10:11Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ergashoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":39.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":42.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":43.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":47.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":51.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":51.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.02},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":577993,"name":"Bitractor Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Deborah, a member of Bitractor Group, is a single mother of four who lives in Nansana, a Kampala City suburb. She deals in garments of different designs. She looks at her children\u2019s education as her major priority since she does not have any other inheritance to distribute to them later in their lifetime.

husband and their five children, whom she loves and who are her main reason for living. She is a very nice, hard-working, enthusiastic person, who, together with her husband, does her utmost to make her family's life better. Unfortunately, due to her lack of financial resources and the fact that she had to start working at a very young age to help her parents, Luc\u00eda was not able to complete her studies in order to learn a profession. In her spare time, she likes to watch television, and she sometimes cooks a delicious duck-and-rice dish called 'arroz con pato', which she shares with her family. On her own initiative, and with lots of effort and dedication, Luc\u00eda works as a farm hand for an agricultural cooperative in her town. She sows, reaps, waters, and does other such tasks. She works about ten hours a day and attributes her success to her hard work and her amiability towards other people. She is very grateful to Kiva lenders, since, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy various types of groceries and drinks, which she will use to open a convenience store. Thus, with the help of her sons, she will be able to both work and tend to the shop, in order to increase her income and make her greatest dream, that of being able to afford a good education for her sons, come true."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1376282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy various types of groceries and drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"SANTIAGO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.160833 -72.257222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia Fredesvinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":78.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":84.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":87.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":93.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":94.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":102.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":106.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":114.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":114.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":120.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":123.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":129.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":138.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":144.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":149.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.02},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":578000,"name":"Aline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aline is 20 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nShe owns a boutique business, which she has been running for the past seven years. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan proceeds, she wants to buy more rice and soaps for re-sale purposes.

She enjoys talking to her customers and getting to know their preferences and which flavours they like. In the future, she wants to have a store or a soda fountain where she can offer a greater variety of drinks and ice creams made from regional fruit. She would like to not be limited to traditional drinks.\r\nShe is requesting 2500 soles. She is grateful to everyone who is making her loan possible; she needs it to achieve her work goals.

In the last harvest, he did not obtain the income he had expected, and this time he wants to increase production. In order to do this, he needs capital. He is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL for the purchase of seeds, fertilizer, manure, herbicides, tools, etc. He will also use it to improve the plot of land in the photo, which is where he wants to sow. Misael's references say that he has an irreproachable character, and that he is responsible and repays his loans. He is confident that he will be able to pay off the debt and, at the same time, provide his family with a full life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1381224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds, fertilizer, manure, herbicides, tools, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Misael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":241.94,"local_amount":241.94,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":241.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479369666},{"amount":158.06,"local_amount":158.06,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T09:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":158.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519530418}],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T09:18:43Z","paid_date":"2014-08-23T09:10:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":578013,"name":"Osita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Osita is a fish vendor.

Kuncup Mekar, this group, still has a wide variety of business efforts, such as catering for offices, grocery shop, clothes and bed linens, credit, household appliances, and selling small meals or snacks.

With this loan from Kiva, they are eager to expand their businesses, increase the types of foods, and add more equipment adequately.\r\n\r\nThe group is led by a woman named Lulu. She is married and has three children, two of whom are in school. Her husband works as a driver on a passenger boat. Lulu opened a catering services business in her home, and has to do all herself because she has not been able to pay auxiliary help power. \r\n\r\nTogether with her husband, Lulu is trying to fill food orders for the offices she serves.

He says that for more than 10 years he has worked selling dough and he does this with the help of his motorcycle. Everyday, Lorenzo gets up very early to start grinding his boiled corn.

Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia. \r\n\r\nYassah is married and has five children between 20 and 9 years old. Only three of her children are in school, and they all live at home. For the past four years Yassah has sold juice in the local market in order to support her children. She started this business by selling for her mother, and she learned the business from her. Yassah likes her business because of the ways people respond to it. She is requesting a loan to purchase more juice for her business. She hopes to earn more money to sustain her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1380488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

She is married and has one son. Firuza's son is married and has two beautiful children. They all live together in one large house. Fizura's husband works as a farmer. \r\n\r\nTo earn a consistent living wage, Firuza works as a merchant. She learned her trade early on in her childhood. When she was 15 years old, she traded products to pay for her school expenses. She used to sell a just bit of produce, but now she has significantly expanded and stabilized her business. Since 2011, she repeatedly received loans from Arvand to grow her business, which helped her successfully expand her business and grow the profits earned from it. \r\n\r\nToday, she has a store where she sells her goods. She also has a wide assortment of food products, consisting of canned foods, pastries, pastas, teas, coffee, as well as household goods such as soap, laundry detergents and others. Firuza buys her products from suppliers and sells them in her neighborhood. \r\n\r\nHer progress does not stop there--she wants to further expand her business, since demand for her existing products is growing and demand for new products is developing in her neighborhood. Firuza has applied for a loan from Arvand to purchase additional products to better equip her store.

Mirabbos is getting ready to marry off his youngest son soon. Despite the fact that his children are grown up and are earning money independently, Mirabbos always helps them as much as he can. Thanks to their father, his children have been able to achieve many things in life. \r\n\r\nMirabbos works as a taxi driver, for which he had to buy his own car. His wife works as the head chef in a local cafeteria. His oldest son works abroad in Russia, and his youngest son works as a painter. All members of the family have their own businesses that bring income for the family. \r\n\r\nIn the near future, Mirabbos intends to marry off his youngest son, and wants to build him a house so that he can live there with his family. His own earnings are not enough to afford building a house. For that reason, Mirabbos turned to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to purchase building materials in order to build a house.

The family resides in their old house on a plot of land. He has been rendering taxi service to local people using his own automobile since 2011. His wife gets a welfare pension monthly. His children both go to high school. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some renovation such as replacing old windows and insulating walls. He is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as vacuum insulated windows, planks, shingles, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, he can repair and insulate his house and provide comfortable and warm accommodations for his family. The renovated house will enable the family to reduce its coal consumption, thus releasing less pollutants into the atmosphere, which will have a positive impact on efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

Six years ago, when she arrived where she lives, she and her father began buying dairy cattle.  Now they have five cows and she has learned from her father how to manage the business, while also taking courses in livestock farming.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting through Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 400 lbs. of soy flour.

Odisha, formed a group with three other women of her locality named \u201cJalakanya\u201d with the intervention of Mahashakti Foundation. The lady standing at the extreme right raising her hand in the photo is Puspanjali. \r\n\r\nShe is a 38-year-old single woman living with her son, age 7 years. She belongs to a Below Poverty Line family (BPL), a segment living on less than a dollar a day. \r\n\r\nPuspanjali started her leaf plate business four years ago on a small scale and has been working hard to grow her business. She makes plates woven out of dry leaves at her house and local traders in the village come and collect them every week. She makes 1,000 to 1,500 plates each week. These plates are biodegradable, disposable, hygienic, and an inexpensive alternative to modern paper or plastic utensils. These are widely used by local food stalls and hotels to serve food. She gets her supply of leaves and bamboo twigs used for stitching from local sellers in the market and sun-dries them for two days to make them ready to be stitched. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the stock she buys from the local sellers is enough for her to make plates for one day and sell the next day. She wants to have enough stock to support her business during the monsoon as well when she cannot get dry leaves. The present loan will be used by her to buy more stock of leaves and bamboo twigs. \r\n\r\nPuspanjali dreams of building a small concrete house for her family and giving proper education to her son. Puspanjali says, \u201cBy successful management of my loans, I have gained more confidence in myself, and I hope that I can do even better to support my family in future.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group, Banalata, Ramadebi and Sandhya are running a leaf plate making and selling business, a tea stall and a vegetable vending business, respectively."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1380671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of more stock of leaves and bamboo twigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bissum Cuttack,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-02T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-01T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandhya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramadebi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T18:29:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":578331,"name":"Ashran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ashran is a 36-year-old married woman.

It was formed in the year 2010. Its five members are all women from the village Bissam Cuttack. It is located in the district of Rayagada, one of the poorest districts in India. Gouri is one of the members of this group. The lady standing extreme right raising her hand in the photo is Gouri. \r\n\r\nShe is 31 years old, living with her husband, one daughter, age 3 and one son, 8 months old. She has been involved in the leaf plate business for the last 10 years. She makes plates woven out of dry leaves at her house and local traders in the village come and collect them every week. She makes 1,000 to 1,500 plates in a week. These plates are biodegradable, disposable, hygienic, and an inexpensive alternative to modern paper or plastic utensils. These are widely used by local food stalls and hotels to serve food. \r\n\r\nGouri gets the supply of the leaves and bamboo twigs used for stitching from the local sellers in the market and sun-dries them for two days to make them ready to be stitched. Currently, the stock she buys from the local sellers is enough for her to make leaves for one day and sell the next day. She wants to have enough stock to support her business during the monsoon as well when she cannot get dry leaves. So the present loan will be used by her to buy more stock of leaves and bamboo twigs. This additional income will supplement her income during bad weather times when it might be difficult to dry leaves. \r\n\r\nGouri dreams of building a small concrete house for her family and giving a proper education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of her group are Pramila, Rabannama, Jaya and Lalita who are running a transporting business with leaf plate trading, a milk business, a tailoring centre and a laundry business, respectively. Since the formation of Chatrapati, all members of the group have been working hard and continue to work with unity, honesty and sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1380678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of more stock of leaves and bamboo twigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bissum Cuttack,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-02T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-01T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pramila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabannama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gouri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-10T23:00:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":578334,"name":"Sumaira's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sumaira, age 31, is the leader of this borrower group.

business in 2011. Restarting her business after such difficult times has been especially rewarding, and admittedly, the second time around has been an incredible learning experience. \u201cIt opened up my mind and taught me the importance of reaching out for help. The resources are there!\u201d \r\n\r\nFollowing the advice of her mom, an accountant, and her loan officer, Leah started using QuickBooks and created a detailed client database. These two changes freed up her time to focus on new marketing ideas and products for clients, including referral and discount programs. She sees that people are starting to spend more on personal care, but understands that in her business, cash flow can be unpredictable.  \r\n\r\nFor the last year, Leah has had her own booth at the salon. She has a permanent disability and having her own space has given her freedom over her schedule, to best serve clients and manage her disability. With the flexible schedule Leah has also been able to attend trade shows to keep up with trends in beauty products and services. She also recently started doing lash extensions. \u201cThis distinguishes me from other estheticians\u201d, said Leah. \u201cThere are not many salons in my area that provide this service and make it affordable.\u201d Her clients include moms who love the lash extensions. \u201cThey are looking to get the latest looks -- to get what celebrities have.\u201d \r\n\r\nLeah is using the loan of $3,700 to purchase products and attend trade shows. It\u2019s all part of a continuing education that she is committed to. \u201cI have so much enthusiasm this time around. I\u2019m fired up and full of creative ideas for the business. I love that I can help people feel beautiful, from the inside out. The second time around she has renewed faith that she will grow her business and one day achieve the dream of opening her own salon. I have always had a \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude, shared Leah. \u201cNow I know more and I am not afraid to ask for help.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1191040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

her old brick house on a plot of land in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nShe made one part of her house into a grocery store where one of her daughters sells various kinds of food. Her elder daughter works at a private business entity. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. So she is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as planks, bricks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, she can repair and insulate her house because, during winter time, the family chills down to its core and she doesn't want her parents to get flu or any sickness. \r\n\r\nThe renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit fewer pollutants and thereby contribute to efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

He wakes up at five in the morning to prepare his products because many city inhabitants start work at this hour. He serves up to 25 customers a day and believes that he is getting ahead because he has a great faith in God and because his food is full of flavor. \r\n\r\nFrancisco is very thankful for the Kiva lenders because thanks to the help brought forth, he will be able to buy fruits at wholesale prices including apples, plantains and papaya, among others.

Though their businesses are still viable, they saw an opportunity to expand by selling solar lamps to their community members.  In their rural setting where there is no electricity, promoting solar will be of double benefit since they will make some income from the sales as well as empower their community by encouraging green energy.  Families purchasing and using solar lamps will no longer have to buy or use kerosene or candles and hence can save money and improve their health.  The women's group will also be sustainable since profits will be ploughed back to grow their stock of solar lamps.  Their vision is to have a one-stop-shop for solar lamps in the region and also also create employment for their children.\n\nNicera, standing on the far left side, is a single mother who runs an electronics shop which she inherited from her father. She used this loan to purchase 24 lamps for resale and to get started in this business.  From the lamp sales she will be able to repay the loan and reinvest into the business.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6125,"image":{"id":1377283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy
