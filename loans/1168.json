He has worked as a taxi driver since he was 19.  He has not had any other job opportunities, so driving his motor taxi is the only work he knows. When he lived with his parents, he had the responsibility of helping his mother, so he was not able to learn any other trade. Fredis' mother later left for the United States to help provide for their family, so Fredis lived with his grandparents.

She describes herself as a hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County. Buchanan is located by the sea.  It is well-known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating 'fufu,' a dish made from a cassava-based dough that is typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city speak Bassa, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nRuth has a table business, where she has been selling food items like Vita, oil, pepper, and onion, for the past three years.  She started in business by selling for her mother.  She works at her business from 8:00AM to 4:00PM each day.  Her greatest challenge in business is low income. She intends to use the loan to buy more Vita, oil, pepper, onion and similar items, to resell at her table.  She likes her business, because it helps her to support her home.  She hopes one day to own a house.  She wants to thank the Kiva lenders, in advance, for their help.

St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for its fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port. It is one of the poorer areas and one will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nMiama completed 12th grade and is married to a policeman. She has three children between the ages of 20 and 13. Only two are in school and they all live at home. Miama has owned her own shop selling used clothes for the past five years. She will use the requested loan proceeds to purchase more used clothes for her business. On average, she works 10 hours a day at her business, which she started with money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by taxi and cites a small income as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is making a profit. In the future, she would like to build a house.

She resides in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County. The county is located by the sea and is known for its beaches and fish. In addition, many logging companies are also located in the city. People in Buchanan are known in the country for their love of fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. \r\n\r\nShe is 39 and married with three children. Her children are between the ages of 23 and 11. Only one is currently living at home, and two are in school. \r\n \r\nYarmah owns her own small local shop business, selling drinks for the past 10 years. She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more drinks (soft drinks, beer, etc.) for her business.\r\n  \r\nOn average, she works 10 hours at her business from Monday to Saturday. She started her business with a small amount of money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by shared taxi. She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is controlling her own money. In the future, she would like to build a modern shop.  \r\n\r\nShe is grateful for your

the age of 5, Wendell knew he had the knack to rap, but he never took music seriously until he reached 19, when he began recording and producing music. \u201cI knew I could do some nice things with it and open a lot of doors,\u201d he says, reflecting on his initial thoughts of rapping. He says now, \u201cMy goal is to try to make a million copies and sell to people; that\u2019s my goal.\u201d\r\n\r\nRapping about life, poverty, life-changing experiences, and general struggles under the name \u201cLock\u201d, Wendell records and produces his own music in his home. Determined to be successful, Wendell converted a former pool house in his back yard into a studio where he produces music off a Compaq computer his mother gave him. Earning $500 to $2,000 per show, the Baton Rouge native plans to be noticed by major labels. Wendell says he tries to perform three shows per month, but it has been slow. He says he could record and produce other rapper\u2019s music, and is currently taking courses in audio engineering for that, but says he needs to prioritize his wants and needs and is focusing on himself at the moment.\r\n\r\nNeeding funds to further his label, Wendell ventured to Accion Texas Inc. after a friend informed him about the nonprofit microlender. \u201cY\u2019all really helped me out a lot,\u201d he says about Accion.

The group is located in a community where the main source of income is in agriculture, planting and harvesting sugar cane. \r\n\r\nFrancisca is one of the members of this group, and she says that for more than 7 years she has sold pork. She makes her sales once a week, and on the day before the sale she goes house to house with her friends and neighbors to offer them the meat and take orders. The next day she lines up the pork and goes out to deliver the meat. She says that she takes full advantages of the pigs, not only selling the meat but also making carnitas, pork rinds, tacos and enchilada meat that helps her to earn more money. \r\n\r\nA loan from VisionFund will give her the opportunity to buy more pigs to continue her sales. She hopes that her business continues to make progress since she has 3 children and she wants to pay for their studies and improve their quality of life. She and her colleagues are thankful for the opportunity to get a loan since it will allow them to invest in their businesses and make them move forward.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nConcepci\u00f3n \u2013 sells chickens\r\nMinerva- sells snacks\r\nInes- sells clothing\r\nFelipa- sells clothing\r\nMarcelina- sells clothing\r\nCecilia- sells snacks.\t\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":1381768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Bre\u00f1a, San Miguel Soyaltepec Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-07-03T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-02T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":2275,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minerva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"In\u00e9s","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":455},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":455},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":455},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":455},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":455}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":455,"local_amount":5800,"processed_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5861.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698689},{"amount":455,"local_amount":5800,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5861.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944852},{"amount":455,"local_amount":5800,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5861.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227926},{"amount":761.36,"local_amount":9705.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:45:17Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991769},{"amount":148.64,"local_amount":1894.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1914.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644428}],"funded_date":"2013-07-15T15:17:52Z","paid_date":"2013-12-18T00:13:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":578715,"name":"Elita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elita is a farmer from the town of San Miguel, Bohol.

In this place they still maintain the Mazahua language, the typical dress - coloured outfits, and food such as huaraches [a fried dough base with toppings], quesadillas, sopes [a similar dish to huaraches], etc. Norma is a very sunny person but most of all, a very hard worker. She has dedicated herself body and soul to ensure the wellbeing of her children. Norma is 40 years old, she has been married to Javier for 23 years. Together they have created a family with three children who are currently studying at university.\r\n\r\nFor the last 15 years, Norma has been working renting furniture like chairs, tables and table linens for special events. She says that they began their business because her husband Javier was working in the town hall and one day he accompanied a person in charge of those events. It was there that they suggested to him that he begin this business because it was very good. It is going very well for them but at times they face two great challenges: competition with their neighbours and when their customers don't pay them in the end. For Norma this is a loss of profit but despite these difficulties she does not give up: \"Many people can begin the same business but there are few who know how to withstand the work that is required to start up the business\". Her customers are already acquaintances, she treats them very well so that they are instilled with confidence to come back again. In addition to the furniture rental, Norma is also starting to sell desserts as a result of courses that she has taken at an educational institution. \r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva and VisionFund for the opportunity to receive a loan.

She says the main challenges faced are unavailability of raw materials and other material for use in her business. \r\n\r\nPrecious has requested a loan of $500 to order more cloth. She needs to buy the raw material in bulk so as to cut costs instead of buying in smaller quantities. The price for a roll of cloth costs around $120, which is much cheaper by at least 30 percent than when buying in smaller quantities. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to increase business capacity and fulfill outstanding orders. This will also enable her to operate profitably on the finished products when pricing them. In the future Precious plans to open a bigger factory as well as a shop selling her products.

Each of them performs an economic activity with the intention of earning money to offer his or her family a better quality of life. The group is located 20 minutes away from the Miguel Alem\u00e1n hydroelectric dam.\r\n\r\nLuciana is one of the members of the group. She is 45 years old. She was only able to go to primary school. She is married to Juan and has a son. Luciana says that for more than 15 years, she has sold snacks. She sells in the primary school in her community during recess. She says that although she only sells for a half hour, her job starts very early at home, making her snacks and at 9:30 she goes to the school to set up her sales spot so that when the children come out at recess at 10:30 she starts to sell. With her husband's help, she also sells pork, chicarrones, longaniza, carne enchilada and carnitas once a week in order to make extra income.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her activity, in addition to earning her own money, is when people like her food. She says that she has customers in  Tuxtepec and Oaxaca who come to visit her when she is on vacation to buy her longaniza or carne enchilada and they take them to other places. This makes her happy.\r\n\r\nShe will invest this loan in buying beans, cheese, corn meal dough, chiles, eggs, oil, lettuce, tomatoes, gas and meat in order to make the snacks, and pork for the meat selling. In the future, she would like to open a butcher shop in her home, as well as improve her family's quality of life and build a house. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nJosefina- selling shoes\r\nTrinidad- selling chicken\r\nRosa Elena- selling groceries\r\nRubicela- selling clothes\r\nOfelia- selling groceries\r\nNicolas- growing corn\r\nAlejandra- selling shoes\r\nLeonor- blacksmithing \r\nCarmen- to sell chicken\r\nMar\u00eda- to sell shoes\r\nClaudia- to sell drinks\r\nAngela- to sell groceries \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7700,"image":{"id":1381773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy beans, cheese, corn meal dough, chiles, eggs,oil, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, gas  and pork.

","en":"Askar is a 37-year old married man living with his family in the village of Sverdlov on the Shahrituz region. Askar has been blessed by five caring daughters who attend school and also help out with household duties. Askar is a building contractor. This work is seasonal, and sometimes it is hard to find customers. This is why Askar decided to launch a business in a different field. He has chosen to raise livestock, more specifically to buy and resell cattle, as this business brings in revenues year round. Askar has experience taking care of animals since his family already keeps cows. Askar is requesting a loan to buy six young bulls. He plans to buy six heads of cattle every month, fatten them for a month and then bring to the animal market in the region. Askar believes that his new business will be successful and bring in good revenues, and, as a result, the financial well-being of his family will improve. He is counting on your support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1383153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy six bulls and calves so as to launch his livestock business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-07-03T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-02T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":2950,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Askar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2941,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":578745,"name":"Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joy is a 23-year-old single woman.

She manages the farming activities and gets some stable income from agriculture. \r\n\r\nNow, realizing that the agricultural business is very important for them, Anzhela and her husband would like to expand it. Anzhela has requested this loan to purchase 3 more cows. This will enable her to gather more dairy products and sell them at the local market.\r\n\r\nAnzhela and her husband are very hardworking and are devoted to their work. They hope that Kiva lenders will support them so they can enrich their farm and improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1381546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

averaging 35 years of age, with five children. They all live in polygamous families in Komo, a village in the [prefecture of] Baguineda in the second administrative district of Mali. They collaborate with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to better manage their agricultural activities during the rainy season. They are on their fifth loan, having duly repaid their prior loans.\r\nThey grow millet, which is the case of Minata, for example. She is the third one standing from the left in the photo. With her loan, she plans to buy agricultural inputs [fertilizers etc] and seeds and pay the cost of labor to work 0.5 ha [about one acre] of land. After harvesting, she sells her produce at the village market to a customer base composed of both resellers and consumers. She plans to earn 100,000 West African francs per agricultural cycle. These revenues will allow her to pay off her loan and also help her husband meet everyday expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1382463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for the costs of labor, agricultural inputs and seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Komo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-07-03T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-02T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minata            Madou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sorofin                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kossira\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kourani                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminatou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba                               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":502314.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459219985}],"funded_date":"2013-08-01T14:13:05Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:41:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":578795,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of seven children, Lourdes works hard to support her family.

In the community there is no electrical lighting.  Currently his family is using lights run by batteries.  They buy batteries because they last longer, and they avoid a fire that could be caused by using candles in their house.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting the loan to buy a 60 watt solar panel.  This way he will live in a better way with his daughters and his wife.  With this system the intensity of light will be greater, and they will no longer have to spend to buy the batteries.  Gaspar\u2019s daughters will be able to do their school work at night, and his wife will be able to take better care of their newborn child.  He hopes to be helped with the approval of this loan so that his family life will

He is a committed client, hard-working, and married with nine children.\n\nHe is confident he will be able to educate all his children, which he wouldn't have done without the financial boost from Ugafode.The extra two people are group members who have signed the waiver but are not taking the loan this cycle.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1381138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy retail stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-07-03T16:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-02T16:50:08Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hope","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dezra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meble","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Junior","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Midius","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ntura","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":637500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":493.75,"local_amount":1275000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1279775.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480871},{"amount":246.88,"local_amount":637500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":639887.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880020},{"amount":246.87,"local_amount":637500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":639887.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983677},{"amount":72.61,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":188202.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635781},{"amount":344.1,"local_amount":888560,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":891887.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863229},{"amount":226.2,"local_amount":584100,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":586287.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752314},{"amount":242.94,"local_amount":627340,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":629689.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233334},{"amount":101.65,"local_amount":262500,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":263483.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468059656}],"funded_date":"2013-08-02T16:50:32Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T17:16:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":577485,"name":"Vicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nVicent is a young hardworking man of 35 years.

At the present time, her husband and two sons are working in Russia.  Farogat has been involved in gardening for 12 years.  She has a small garden with apricot trees that she takes care of herself.  Every year, Farogat and her family pick ripe apricots and dry them in the sun in the yard of their house.  Then, they take dried apricots to local markets for sale.  This is a fairly profitable family business.  Currently, Farogat intends to expand her garden.  She is requesting this loan to purchase 50-60 seedlings of apricots and mineral fertilizers.  Farogat hopes that she will be supported in realizing her goal and thanks everyone for the support in

She lives in the \"20 de Noviembre\" neighborhood of Puntarenas, a place with a lot of poverty and social problems.  She is 48 years old, and lives with her husband and daughter, who currently attends school.  With effort and hard work, and with the support of Fundacion Mujer for more than 15 years, Mayra has managed to establish a customer base for her business selling clothing and personal items, which she sells door-to door. She has managed to give her daughters an education, acquire other goods, and along with her husband, who tends to a small grocery store, they have managed to get ahead.  \r\n\r\nThe goal for this loan is to buy merchandise, mainly seasonal clothing, because in Costa Rica, Mother's Day is approaching (August 15), and so she doesn't want to miss the opportunity to change her products.  Because of her experience and knowledge of the market, this is something that her customers look forward to with anticipation.  \r\n\r\nMayra belongs to the communal bank \"Mujer Creciendo Juntas,\" which has supported other women with loans for their businesses, but at her level, she needs to make a bigger investment in her small business.  \r\n\r\nAmong her goals, the one that stands out is to get ahead so that her family can have a better future and improve their quality of life.  She also wants to support her business so that it grows over time.  At this time, her greatest difficulty has been the economy, and also the competition from the people who sell from catalogs.  However, she has found support for her small business in this program, and with her experience she has managed to maintain a set of active customers who have good credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1382684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Puntarenas, 20 de Noviembre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2013-07-03T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-02T21:30:04Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":22790.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":23170.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":23556.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":23949.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":24348.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":24754.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25167.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25586.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":26013.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":26446.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":26887.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":27327.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.97,"local_amount":22986.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":23095.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400039430},{"amount":46.37,"local_amount":23183.1,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":23293.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410094998},{"amount":47.12,"local_amount":23560.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":23673.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430063404},{"amount":50.25,"local_amount":25126.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25246.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439997398},{"amount":98.32,"local_amount":49159.14,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":49394,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449638980},{"amount":102.67,"local_amount":51336.94,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51582.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467920182},{"amount":55.11,"local_amount":27599.04,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":27730.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.09,"payment_id":479140941},{"amount":107.27,"local_amount":53635.93,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":53892.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504260966},{"amount":46.83,"local_amount":23412.94,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":23524.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543254}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T02:03:14Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:42:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":578432,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena is a very charming woman who lives in a small flat in Getahovit village with her husband, son, and mother-in-law.

Anusuya, the energetic lady of 40 years sitting second from right with raised hand, is one of them. She is very active and always cheerful. Her family consists of her husband, one son aged seventeen, and three daughters aged twenty-five, twenty-three and twenty.\n\nFrom last twenty five years Anusuya is running a cloth vending business with the help and support of her husband.As this is their traditional business, her husband was already doing this business before her marriage. After marriage both of them are managing the business. She purchases saris from the local market and from the weavers of her village and brings the ready-made garments from a wholesale market 200 kilometers away. Her husband moves to different villages and weekly markets on a bike for selling saris and garments. \n\nShe earns a monthly income of 8,000 Indian Rupees (INR) from her existing business, but that is not sufficient to manage the business expenses as well as the household expenses for her six-member family. So Anusuya wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business. Looking into the coming festive season, from the present loan she is planning to purchase some quality saris and fancy garments for selling. Anusuya assumes that this will definitely generate a handsome amount of extra income. Anusuya has a dream to save enough money for the marriage of her daughters in a respectable manner.\n\nThe other three members of the group are Sanjuta with Tiffin business and Saraswati and Sindhu with cloth vending business.

In addition, he will buy some plants that are well-developed and healthy for the seedling nursery in order to replant when the rains start.  \r\n\r\nHis objective for doing so is to increase the density of plants in the area.  He will also take advantage of the good, fertile soil, the climate, and other conditions that are favorable for growing coffee.  With these crop improvements, he hopes to get a little profit and, in this way, improve his family\u2019s living conditions.  He will also invest a little more in the area that he cultivates and fulfill some goals.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan he has received from FUDECOSUR.  He has not had any previous loan with state banks.  FUDECOSUR has offered him the loan with better terms and a much lower interest rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1382711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy what he needs for his coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Miguel, Pejibaye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2013-07-03T22:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-02T22:40:07Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Ramiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225.23,"local_amount":112615.73,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":113153.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542515832},{"amount":274.77,"local_amount":137384.27,"processed_date":"2014-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":138040.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579564355},{"amount":0.73,"local_amount":365.41,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":367.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649567337},{"amount":499.27,"local_amount":249634.59,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":250827.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347322}],"funded_date":"2013-07-20T02:30:04Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:48:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":578974,"name":"Rasheed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rasheed is a 34-year-old married man from Khanyounis.

The members of Women Group, together, are borrowing GHS 7,300, which they will use to expand their businesses.\r\n\r\nThe loan they will receive will benefit small businesses, such as the one run by Naomi. She joined ID-Ghana a year ago and came together with other members to form this group. She currently has a business selling milk, eggs and bread, a business she started on her own initiative 15 years ago. The share of the loan that Naomi will receive will be used as working capital, to buy one carton of milk and three crates of eggs. She buys them wholesale at markets and then sells them from her own store. The money she earns allows her to maintain her family as best she can. She is married and has three children. Naomi is 38 years old, and her husband is a tailor.\r\n\r\nWhat Naomi cherishes most about ID-Ghana is the health insurance subsidy policy.

Ju\u00e1n Luis also hopes to invest a little more in his fields and achieve some of his goals. This is the first loan he has received from FUDECOSUR.
