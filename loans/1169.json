The idea is to make good use of the space he has for pasture, which is well developed, and of the good conditions of the soil and the weather. That way he'll be able to have the animal and raise a good calf in order to sell it for butchering later on.

His goal is to increase the density of his plants per area, also taking advantage of the good fertility of the soil and climate and other conditions that are favorable to the cultivation of coffee.  With these improvements, he hopes to obtain a bit more income and in this way improve his family's living conditions.  Also, he will invest a bit more in his land and also accomplish some other goals.  This is the first loan that he has received from FUDECOSUR.  He has not taken loans from the state banks before, but FUDECOSUR has provided him with a loan with better terms and a much lower interest rate.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1382749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy supplies and pay for labor for his coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Miguel, Pejibaye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2013-07-04T01:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-03T01:10:04Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1.86,"local_amount":931.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":935.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855295},{"amount":200.01,"local_amount":100004.68,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":100482.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459101154},{"amount":40.08,"local_amount":20038,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20133.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504256793},{"amount":32.64,"local_amount":16321.4,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":16399.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540442},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":13545.32,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":13610.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530023722},{"amount":48.74,"local_amount":24368.94,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":24485.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611783756},{"amount":34.7,"local_amount":17350.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":17433.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231319},{"amount":35.88,"local_amount":17939.51,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":18025.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636217097},{"amount":32.52,"local_amount":16260.6,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":16338.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665436344},{"amount":27.26,"local_amount":13631.52,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":13696.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347324},{"amount":41.84,"local_amount":20922.15,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":21022.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557765},{"amount":38.55,"local_amount":19277.15,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":19369.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711472745},{"amount":38.83,"local_amount":19408.95,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":19501.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991859}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T14:21:51Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T14:19:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":579003,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie is 49 years old and married with four children.\r\n\r\nRosalie works hard to provide for her family.

For now the greatest difficulty has been economic but she has found in this program a support for her small-business venture.\r\n\r\nThis is a strong group that has worked with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer since the year 2004, fulfilling, with this one, twelve loan requests, with more than 20 women from the community of \"20 de Noviembre\" in the area of Puntarenas having been involved in the group.  They have demonstrated work, growth, unity and solidarity and their payments have been good.  The group has demonstrated good payment conduct and has renewed their loans year after year.  Their activities are generating revenue that allows them to travel abroad to purchase merchandise (Nicaragua and Panam\u00e1).  They have their own establishments, their own equipment, and offer a wide range of products in the places where they live.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1382742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase merchandise, clothing, perfumes, cosmetics and other things.

He lives in the small village of Sachkhere District with his wife and 20-year-old son. Murman has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMurman is an artisan and works on private orders to renovate houses. Additionally, he is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has two pigs and sells piglets. The income is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMurman has now requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Murman has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Murman will purchase a stock of groceries and open a grocery shop. As the shop is opened, his wife will work as a saleslady and they both will do their best to increase the income of their family. Part of the income will be reinvested in the business.

She herself has been working at the train station for twenty years and is considered to be the best worker by her colleagues. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has deteriorated over the years and it needs some serious repair. So she is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, planks, metals, fiberglass, foam, and a low pressure heater. Using those materials, her husband can make repairs and insulate their house, thus providing more comfortable and warmer accommodations for the whole family. \r\n\r\nThe renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, thus releasing less pollutants into the air, which contributes to the efforts against air pollution.

Her family lives in a ger district full of traditional Mongolian gers (portable felt dwellings) and low quality houses.

Her husband specializes in driving various types of automobiles and works for private business company. \r\n\r\nUsing her previous loan, she purchased building materials in order to repair and insulate her house.

work an additional full-time job. He led this lifestyle until 2009 when his company was bought out and his department was shut down. Rather than search for another job, he decided to invest himself full-time in his business and to provide his clients with three types of services: accounting, individual and corporate taxes, and payroll. He currently has 250 clients for individual taxes, 50 for corporate taxes, 40 for monthly accounting and 25 for payroll. \r\n\r\nLast February, Ricardo decided to get a virtual office with Regus in order to give his business a more professional aspect. The largest difficulty he has run into is with marketing, a problem he hopes to alleviate with this loan.\r\n\r\nRicardo is especially passionate about his business because it allows him to work on what he studied in the past. He currently lives with his former wife, as they decided it would be best for their daughters.

When asked how the loan will benefit her family, Mercy replied, \"Uplifting living standards.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Mercy owns poultry but reports that she does not own the following: \"cow, pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.\" Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in her household \"mosquito net, electricity, running water, TV, DVD\" but does not have \"solar power, sewing machine.\"\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs down.\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1382487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Muranga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-07-04T17:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-03T17:10:11Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1475.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1514.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1554.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1595.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1638.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1681.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1725.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1771.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1818.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1918.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.78,"local_amount":2542.66,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2730.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417398},{"amount":26.66,"local_amount":2133.18,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2290.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980909},{"amount":19.94,"local_amount":1594.93,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1712.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529581},{"amount":45.46,"local_amount":3637.09,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3905.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753457},{"amount":64.89,"local_amount":5191.11,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-26T09:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5573.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449657985},{"amount":47.62,"local_amount":3809.53,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4090.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343342},{"amount":13.65,"local_amount":1091.5,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467943908}],"funded_date":"2013-07-07T08:49:20Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T13:33:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":579281,"name":"Bwagonga Tukore Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bonny, a member of Bwagonga group, who is a mother of five, divorced the father of her children for practicing polygamy, a decision she made after forecasting that the future of their family was at stake due to the little income they used to get. \r\n\r\nShe decided to remain a single mother so that she can raise her children well and also concentrate on agriculture.

With the profit received, she bought a TV and solar power, and paid school fees and household expenses. \r\n\r\nSophia will use this loan to buy more fish to resell. Sophia dreams to one day be able to build a house for renting and to be in a good position for affording school expenses for her kids.  \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group\" Mloganzila\", which totals 11 members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":1382502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fish to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2013-07-04T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-03T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#TeamGuysHoldingFish"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yasin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramadhani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agness","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shabani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfredy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":4950000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":412500},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":412500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":508.33,"local_amount":825000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":829335.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390688307},{"amount":508.34,"local_amount":825000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":829335.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399934946},{"amount":508.33,"local_amount":825000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":829335.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410218231},{"amount":578.28,"local_amount":938522.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":943454.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419982151},{"amount":692.55,"local_amount":1123977.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1129884.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429634081},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":412500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":414667.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439861395}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T05:08:44Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:51:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":579328,"name":"Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ann lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is the training grounds for many of Kenya's Olympic runners.

I work in stone because of the beautiful things that can be made with each kind. I like stone's naturalness and purity of color.\"\r\n\r\n\"To all of you who are assisting me with this loan, I send you blessings.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I am the fourth generation in a family dedicated to Zapotec weavings. I remember as a child watching my father working on the loom while my mother and grandmother carded and dyed the wool. We shear the fleece, spin it and dye it with tints from the cochineal insect, pomegranate peel, bark from the huajal tree that thrives here, as well as oak and pecan bark. Stones, dried flowers, almost all the rocks and flowers here yield natural colors. My wife and I work together in our home. We help each other, and in this way we can finish our rugs sooner. I especially like diamond motifs, as they represent a kind of maguey coat of arms seen at Monte Alb\u00e1n. They exemplify my Zapotec heritage.\"\r\n\r\n\"First of all, I want to thank all of you who help fund these microcredits, which benefit people like my family and me.

Sarah walks every day to buy her ingredients, since her shop is very close to the local market. She is requesting a loan to purchase more rice, pepper, fish, vita, dry bushmeat, onions and coal, etc. for her business. She plans to buy a piece of land and build a house.

The house they live in has vulnerable walls and, during the winter time, strong winds and frosts chill the family members down to their cores. So she is applying for a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to buy vacuum-insulated windows, fiberglass and foam. Installing vacuum windows and insulating their walls with fiberglass and foam will ensure that the house will no longer lose its heat through its windows and walls. More importantly, the family will began to burn less coal for heating, which will have a positive impact on the efforts against air pollution, because there will be less release of carbon dioxide.

He knew it would be hard to start from scratch, but he persevered in light of this uncertainty. During his first few years in the United States, he studied and worked as a technician installing cable TV and satellite. He did so until he was able to start buying his own equipment for resale. Gradually, he became a distributor and waved goodbye to his days as an installation technician. For that past few years he has been working from home using a rental storage unit to keep boxes fully organized for immediate distribution.\r\n\r\nHis business is profitable at the moment; however, he is in need of a loan to increase working capital to buy dishes and antennas, allowing him to have more in stock to commit to more local installers. His goals for the future include becoming an authorized dealer for big companies such as Dish Network and Direct TV and becoming one of the largest satellite providers in Southern Florida.\r\n\r\nHe currently lives with his wife and daughter, who rely on him for financial support.

To do this, she needed money to purchase her product.  LaVonne came to Accion Texas Inc. after discovering the nonprofit microlender at a local bank in her neighborhood.

Parveen has some savings, but they are insufficient to buy a new auto rickshaw. That is why she requested a loan of PKR 40,000 so that her husband could buy a new auto rickshaw.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan can bring happiness and joy to her family\u2019s life and she can

Francisco, Suchitep\u00e9quez, are calling themselves the Mujeres Negociantes (Business Women) as that is precisely how they see themselves. Each of them is eager to improve their lives and families and they believe they will be able to do this through their businesses, despite the difficult economic situation in Guatemala. The group is composed of a diverse collection of businesses that includes small stores selling daily need products, clothing sales, shoe sales and even a Christian bookstore.  \n\nGabriela Cecilia is one of the members of the Mujeres Negociantes. She is a young single mother with a 4 year-old son, whom she has been raising on her own for the last three years.  Gabriela has an 8th grade education.  Two years ago, her mother gave her Q500 (US$65) to host a birthday party for her then 2 year-old son. However, instead of investing in a party, Gabriela Cecilia took the money and bought blouses and pants to re-sell, igniting her entrepreneurial spirit. She realized that she and her child\u2019s need went beyond a one day event and she thought if she could make money on the money given to her by her mother, she would be able to provide for herself and her son. \n\nSince that day, Gabriela has continued to be involved in the sale of clothes. Her dream is to increase her stock of products and add lingerie to her business as well as purchase her pants in blouses in bulk. She currently has a profit of Q639 (US$83) and works 2 hours a day Monday thru Friday, averaging $1.38\/hour.  Her business plan shows that with a loan of she will be able to improve her stock of lingerie, blouses and pants.
