She is determined to remove her family from the darkness brought by poverty. She is widowed and has two children to take care of.\r\nWith her desire to earn an income through a business, in 1999 she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Her loans were used as capital for her Sari-sari store (General Store). She is one of the outstanding members of ASHI . As her business is properly managed, it brings her enough income to sustain the needs of her family.\r\nShe is now excited to receive her loan of 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her Store.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The women of the committee are all working together, helping each other to reach their common goals. \r\n\r\nIt's a very supportive group, and they have worked hard to make sure they all repay their

Through their daily work, they are reaching this goal and little by little feeling proud of their accomplishments.  They live in the city of Cuenca which is a city noted for its charming historic downtown as well as its combination of three cultures rich in symbolism, tradition and art: Ca\u00f1ari, Inca and Spanish.  Communal bank member Ana P., 20, lives in the Miraflores section of the city.  She is single and lives with her parents, helping them meet household expenses; they do not own their home, they lease.  Ana works in an Internet caf\u00e9 from 8:30am until 7pm; she has worked there for 11 months and has done well.  She also sells women's beauty products of the Yanbal brand.  She began this work again 3 months ago; she had previously sold these products to her school friends.  She tells us that she does well because her customers pay on time.  Her goal for this new year is to start her studies again.  She gets along well with all the other members of the communal bank.  She has been managing her loans with the institution for 2 years now and they have helped her to buy Yanbal products and to help with the family rent payment.  She was encouraged to join the communal bank by her mother.  The new loan will be used to buy Yanbal products such as: perfumes, chains, make-up, etc.  Her goal is to become a physician.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She works daily as a cleaning lady in various homes in the area but six months ago she found an occupation that she likes a lot and that she can do in her spare time.  She makes all kinds of accessories for women like:  earrings, necklaces and bracelets.  She makes them with various kinds of stones which she buys at wholesale.  Her children then help her sort them, which allows her to move ahead faster.  She works in partnership with a friend, who's job it is to go out and sell the completed pieces.  Both her jobs produce needed profits which, together with her husband's earnings, pay for household expenses and education costs of the children.  For the future, Carmen would like to start to sell her accessories independently because she figures her profits would be higher that way.  This is her first loan with MFP and she promisses to be punctual with her payments because she is already planning to request future loans.  Carmen intends to use the funds to buy supplies to continue to make her accessories and to start to become independent.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":477128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T20:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":78.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":88.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":89.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":96.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":101.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":105.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":110.61},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":116.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":119.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.51,"local_amount":78.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":84.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960271},{"amount":33.04,"local_amount":88.1,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":94.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993115},{"amount":33.47,"local_amount":89.25,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":95.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717901},{"amount":34.98,"local_amount":93.28,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":99.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751576},{"amount":36.18,"local_amount":96.48,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":103.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934044},{"amount":38.17,"local_amount":101.81,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":108.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672821},{"amount":39.64,"local_amount":105.7,"processed_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":112.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886675},{"amount":41.48,"local_amount":110.61,"processed_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":118.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153783},{"amount":88.53,"local_amount":236.08,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":252.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449191}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T22:58:50Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":175667,"name":"Busaana Development Group, Lugazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"O.

The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\n\nFarida works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and currently earns about 80 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more ingredients such as rice, wheat flour, maize flour and cooking oil in bulk for business.\n\nIn the future, Farida plans to expand her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":505302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more ingredients such as rice, wheat flour, maize flour and cooking oil in bulk for business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farida S.

What she likes the most is to look after her customers, who already know the quality of the chicken and pork crackling that she prepares, selling it every day, from 5 in the afternoon until ten in the evening. And so 20 years have passed while running this business, her work consisting of walking long distances selling food. Her daily task is to try to sell the 35 portions that she makes daily. On the other hand, her husband works in public transport, using a rented motorbike cart and the profits that he receives helps in the household expenses. Nevertheless Santos has to work hard to help her youngest daughter who is mentally disabled.

He is married and has no children.\r\n\r\nPatrick has requested this loan of 61,200 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says this loan will help improve the livelihood of his family since he will be able to provide enough milk for domestic consumption.\r\n\r\nIn five years time, Patrick hopes to have acquired five more dairy cows and be a major supplier of milk to the Kenya Cooperative Creameries.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":605159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

They are micro-business people who work in the sale of clothing, natural products, shoes, etc., and in education in the city of San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for its ball players and for its sugar industry. Its present economy depends on the free-trade zone, the cement industry, and other lesser activities such as tourism. This member of Esperanza International is the mother of two children and began working with Esperanza International because she had the dream of having a little school in her community. She began the school with her first loan. Now it is four years later and she is receiving her tenth loan. For each loan she has made her payments in a satisfactory manner and she has made good investments. Through her business (the school) she makes a good contribution to the community, since she offers a good private education at a low monthly cost.\r\n\r\nPetronila is planning to invest her new loan in the purchase of children's school supplies and products for the school cafeteria. She will use her earnings to invest in her business, buying fans and doing more advertising, although now she has fewer students because of the economic problems of their parents. Her greatest challenge is being able to pay her employees, since at this time the school has less income. Her dream is to have more students and a better school with more teachers, and when she achieves this she will be able to help the most needy families -- at the least, she wants to help them in their education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":614860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

She lives in Poblacion, Basay, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1994 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $237. \r\n\r\nNelly is now borrowing 29,500 PHP so that she can purchase more inventory to sell. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nelly aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. is 38 years old, married and has three children with her husband Justini: Anna, 15, Helena, 13 and Paulo, 7. Since 2002, Sarah has run a business selling charcoal. These small pieces of black, dry earth are important to Sarah and her customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still do their cooking in small coal pots in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal pieces) and add paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene to light the flame. The fire requires constant fanning, which makes cooking a hot, laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford. This is good news for Sarah, who requires a loan of $875 to add to her stock of mkaa and continue meeting customer demand.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania, where customs and traditions normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. Because they lack tangible collateral assets, women are considered not credit-worthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low income.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through <i><b>Micro Leasing<\/b><\/i> as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women.

Elena and her husband have worked in agriculture for 20 years, planting the native products of their area like potatoes and oca.  They also raise animals.  She works hard, so that after several months she can obtain the fruits of her labor.  Therefore, she gets up very early to prepare the food and to get her children ready for school.  Everyday she feeds her animals and then goes to her plots of land, that are far away, where she looks over her plants to see how they are doing.  She then returns to the stable to check on her animals.  After several months of this busy routine, Elena and her husband sell what they have harvested and the animals they have fattened.  They use what they earn to maintain their family.  \r\n\r\nFor many years this work has been the only source of income for the family.

She hails from the coastal town of Cardona, Rizal Province in the Philippines. She is mother to three children and lives happily with her husband, Romeo, who is a 35-year-old fisherman.\r\n\r\nShe believes that one should use her God-given talent to get out of poverty. In 2007, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, hoping to have access to capital for her sewing business. She sews fishing nets for fisherman to buy.\r\n\r\nNow on her 4th loan, she proposes a loan of 20,000 pesos as rolling capital for her sewing business. The loan will be used to buy two bundles of fishnets, big spools of thread, and bamboo that she will use to prepare fishing gear. Since fishing is one of the most common sources of income in their town, she hopes that her business will catch the eyes of fishermen. She also dreams of having her own house, sending her children to school, and later, having her own fish pond for much bigger income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":361494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Letecia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional dried fish to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Letecia from GDMPC.

of Peace) communal bank which came together in the city of Cuenca.  Cuenca is the capital of the Azuay province and is renowned for its beautiful architecture, its beautiful temples, the four rivers that bathe the city, and the able hands of its craftspeople as well as for its warm and kindhearted inhabitants.  Patricia lives in the Totoracocha community, is married and has three children, 22, 20, and 18 years of age.  Her first two are students at the Instituto Sudamericano and her youngest daughter studies at the Ricardo M\u00e1rquez Tapia Institute.  Her husband is a mechanic and together they watch after the wellbeing of their home.  She still does not have a home of her own; she lives with her in-laws.  Patricia prepares meals that she home delivers.  Besides, she owns a small grocery store in her mother's house in the community of Lim\u00f3n, which is in the eastern part of Ecuador.  She travels there on weekends to see how the store is doing and to stock it with merchandise.  She has done this for 7 years.  She tells us that five years ago she was a member of the bank but had to leave for personal reasons.  However, now she is back and very happy because soon she will receive the requested loan with which she will buy kitchen equipment and pots that she needs to set up her restaurant.<br

She buys fresh fish from fishermen, then dries the fish and sells it. She has been running this business for 32 years and hopes to own a bigger business in the near future.  Martha started selling with a small amount of money from her late husband.  She has been facing problems recently with the high prices of goods and too many vendors with the same business in the New Matadi Peace Market.\r\n\r\nShe talks to her customers in a friendly manner in order to encourage them to continue buying from her.

He lives in his own house with his wife, Elena, who is 38 years old, and their 3 young children, for whom he desires to provide a better quality of life.  He owns a lot of land and has become one of the main producers in his area (cultivating bananas, ginger, and coffee).  He transports his products to the city of Pichanaki to sell them to pre-arranged buyers since his produce is of very high quality.  His favorite part of his job is harvesting his crops and he works very hard at it.  He has been doing this activity for 10 years and believes that the hardest part is protecting his fields from the plagues that can harm crops.  In the future he desires to buy more land and expand his fields.  This is his third loan with MFP and he is prepared to make punctual payments.  He has already started saving his money for this purpose.  His community bank group considers him a very happy man who is always up to date with the news of those who attend their meetings.  With the 2,500 nuevos soles he is requesting, he will purchase more fertilizer for his crops.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":564897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-08T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2543.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195414}],"funded_date":"2010-07-10T01:37:24Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":217078,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn V. is from the city of Rizal Santiago.

one permanent employee and four casual laborers. Her mixed farm produces milk, which she sells through Kenya Cooperative Creameries, and coffee, which she sells through the Coffee Board of Kenya. She also earns income from her posho mill and through the sale of bananas to the local market.<p>\r\n\r\nJoyce has requested this loan of 63,600KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. She says this loan will help increase her income and enable her to educate her son to the university level.  She currently has two dairy cows producing six liters of milk daily but hopes her milk output will increase to over 30 liters daily in the near future. Joyce says the future is bright with Juhudi loans as she will be able to do farming as a business and create wealth for her family.<p>\r\n\r\nJoyce is 52 years old.

He is married to Sra. Hilda and they have six children, of whom two are already independent.  Elias works as a mason in the area where he lives, but he also receives contracts from other provinces within the department as well as from the city.\r\n<p>\r\nElias lived in the city of Santa Cruz five years ago before returning to Cochabamba because of a problem with his sister-in-law.  Through the fault of this person, Elias lost his house and all of his belongings were auctioned off by the bank.  He and his family picked themselves up and moved in a new direction so that they could start over.  Elias and his wife now have a cottage and land for growing corn, which is harvested every six months and provides an additional source of income.  While Elias is working as a mason on different construction jobs, his wife works at a plant nursery caring for flowers that are grown in the area for specific times of the year.  They also grow potatoes and corn to help support their family.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan Elias is requesting will be used to purchase water so that he can irrigate his crops of potatoes and corn throughout the year.  This will help him earn more income so that his children can finish their high school studies.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Elias dreams of seeing his children finish high school since he was not able to earn a degree.  He wants them to pursue a degree so that they can help people in the area."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":635023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Acquire

The business is lucrative since bananas are a staple food, especially in western Uganda. Leopold combines this business with coffee sales and it is actually the profits from the coffee sales that enabled him to start his current business, which he finds more worthwhile due to the large number of people who purchase bananas weekly and especially on market days.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She's working 10 to 12 hours a day to fulfill her dream. Nancy lives with her husband and says that they only want to have more children when they are sure that they can raise them without worrying about where their next meal will come from or that the children would be forced to leave school because they can't provide for them. Nancy owns a small plot of inherited land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for more than five years. She grows a variety of crops and keeps dairy cows and poultry. The income she makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet her family's expenses. She needs to improve her income level, and that is why she is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Nancy passionately loves dairy farming and, as she likes to put it, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart.\u201d She plans to buy not just an ordinary cow but a quality breed of cow that will produce between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan and will also go towards the education of her children. She will also benefit from cow manure, which will be used to increase the fertility level of her farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan she will also be able to build a biogas digester that will be helpful in saving energy. This loan will completely change her life and improve her living conditions.\nNancy needs a little help so that she can improve her milk selling business and can accomplish her dreams, loan now.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2048312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":3198,"name":"Saleh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saleh is a 37 years old IDP and father of 2 children.

Don Julio C\u00e9sar has been working since he was 16 and never had an opportunity to study because of lack of funding.<p> He is presently living in the city of Juliaca and is offering urban transportation. Originally he drove a small tricycle which he conditioned and improved to transport comfortably 3 individuals, nevertheless the income was  insufficient to cover his personal expenses. After having worked very hard for some time, Julio C\u00e9sar had saved enough money to buy a motorized vehicle which he also uses for transportation service.

The \"People Committee\" of her village (UBND x\u00e3 ) had implemented a program to encourage farming. They would exchange farm land for  unexploited one. Ms T\u00e2m and her husband decided to make an exchange for an acre of land for fish farming. She was one of the first to exploit farming. She had some successes and some failures but she did not get discouraged. She was determined to reach her goal. With dedication and determination, she had been able to turn her farming business into a profitable one. Today she owns 1 acre for fish farming, a paddle of 200 egg laying ducks, 150 chicks. She had also invested in pig raising, she has 3 sows and 3  herds of piglets. The production from her family's farm is quite impressive (2 tons of pork, 1 ton of fish, 200 egg laying ducks). On average, her family makes about 450 USD\/ month.

She has been married for 18 years, and is mother to 4 children who currently live with her.  She works cultivating fruit with her husband, but art and creativity are what she has in abundance.  For this reason, what she enjoys most is making native \"cushmas\", a type of outfit made from a single piece of cloth.  She complements this item of clothing with necklaces and bracelets made from native seeds, which, in festival periods, can be sold for 20 to 30 soles per day. She rents the outfits she makes to high schools and elementary schools for 8 soles each, though occasionally she can negotiate up to 25 soles for each one.  Nercy likes making all types of clothing and dresses, but she does not neglect her agricultural work.  Every 15 days she harvests bananas and sells them from her own subsistence farm.\r\n\r\nNercy is the treasurer of her communal bank, in charge of collecting monthly payments from the members, under the supervision of the credit advisor.  This is her second loan through MFP, and she has been punctual in her payments.  The money that she is requesting is to purchase fertilizer for her banana farm to maintain its good production, and to purchase seeds and fabrics to make necklaces and outfits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":272004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of materials for her work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T22:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423762},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117072},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011985},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595570},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989832},{"amount":29.76,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210968}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T00:02:42Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":93334,"name":"Khaled","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khaled is a 49-year-old man who lives in Saida, southern Lebanon, with his wife and their four children.

She lives with her husband who transports passengers.  \r\n\r\nFor 4 years she has been selling chilled products like ice, popsicles, jell-o, soft drinks, etc. in the space she had built in her house.  Carmen also travels the streets of her city selling her products.  \r\n\r\nShe works hard for the well being of her children, and that is what motivates her to work every day.  The work has been profitable because her products sell easily.  She receives daily earnings, which makes her feel satisfied.  Most of her customers are children.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Carmen would like to have a grocery store in her house to sell her products and other foods.  She has had 9 loans with MFP.

Her previous loan was used as capital for her secondary business in the resale of toys for kids. But just recently, she opted to change her business to fish selling. She is positive that her business will grow and will bring her enough proceeds to live on.\r\n\r\nNow on her second loan, she proposes an amount of 10,000 pesos as starting capital for her proposed business of fish selling. The loan will be used to pay for 120 kilos of assorted fish. She is looking forward to having a space in the market someday and also to renovating her house into more spacious and more durable one.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":361540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She lives in La Maica district, an outlying district of the city of Cochabamba, where she tends to her cattle.\r\n\r\nAdela is married and has 5 young children who she looks after and supports through her raw milk business.  Both herself and her husband get up every day for their day's work cutting fodder to feed their cows.  At 6 o'clock in the morning they milk their cows so that they can begin to collect the milk which they will sell in the market.  At around midday they feed their cows again and at 6 in the evening they must milk them again.\r\n\r\nEvery day they do this work.  They are used to working hard by now because they want their children, although they are still young, to have a better life, to finish their studies and to become professionals.\r\n\r\nAdela is requesting a loan to buy fodder (soya) for her cattle since she would like to take advantage of the opportunity to be able to buy the soya in large quantities so that it will last her for at least a few months, rather than having to keep buying it nearly every

In 2012, the members of Wekhakila group will each plant maize plots between half and one acre of land.\r\nIn the photograph above, Amos is pictured with his group members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":917237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-23T21:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":27300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":27300,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":27330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680923}],"funded_date":"2011-11-26T13:09:01Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":364651,"name":"Norma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norma tiene 54 a\u00f1os D. edad, es conviviente y tiene 2 hijos.

They currently live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nShe has worked as a nurse in the hospital in the city of Tarma for the past 23 years, and feels very productive in this profession. She has made the most of her many friendships to start her business selling beauty products from three different brands, all related to cosmetics and perfume. \r\n\r\nShe says that each order she makes to these beauty companies is between 900 and 1000 soles per month, and for each one of these orders she earns 20 percent. She uses her earnings to continue investing in the business and for her personal expenses. She is very happy with her additional job promoting beauty products, as it allows her to increase her income and make her household more comfortable. She has worked in this field for 5 years, and it has been very profitable for her.  She tries to make the most of her free time, doing her accounts and showing her catalogues for the next round of orders. \r\n\r\nEsmerelda is a very active woman, and in addition to her two jobs she attends all of the meetings and activities that are programmed within her community bank. She is the president of the community bank, and has been selected again to hold this position. This will be her eighth loan, and has demonstrated that she makes her repayments punctually.

They live in their own home with their five children: Wilmer, 18, Luis, 16, Pedro, 14, Jhosep, 12, and Edson, 3.  She works embroidering dresses in her home.  Her business consists of decorating dresses that her friend buys in bulk.  She decorates with beads, sequins, and stones.  She is then paid a set amount of money for each dress.  So that she does not have work pile up, Liliana has her friends help with some of the work so they can decorate dresses and then she pays them a percentage of her pay.  She likes her job very much since she can employ all of her creativity, and also because the earnings are immediate.  Even so, she would like to have something more stable that she could run from her home, and so she has thought about installing a small grocery store.  This would allow her to spend more time with her family and generate more income.  Liliana is now in her third loan with Microfinanzas Prismo, having been very punctual and responsible with the payments.  She is also very happy with her community bank.  With the money she is requesting she will buy more dress decorating materials to be able to earn enough to start her grocery store.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":293352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy embroidery materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012337},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595926},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990189},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211314},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640828},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":104.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080297}],"funded_date":"2009-03-25T00:07:23Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":101542,"name":"Hawa C.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings) from Tanzania!

She sells to an average of 50 people a day and sells to all kinds of people. Margaret buys raw ingredients from Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in Kampala, and uses public transport to get to and from shopping. Besides frying food, she operates a ladies salon also in Kasubi. She has been in business for the last nine years. She works seven days a week. Her main challenge is the rainy season which disrupts her as she works in an open place. \r\n<p>\r\nMargaret is the leader of the five members of this group. Margaret lives and works in a semi urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. She is 37 years old and married with four children, ages 2 to 12 years. Three of her children go to school. She lives in a rented two-room house with six people (Margaret  takes care of additional family members). There is electricity but no piped water in her home. The family gets two meals a day. Her major monthly expenses include medication, school fees and food for the family. \r\n<p>\r\nMargaret has been with MCDT for over eight months and is on her second loan working with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more cooking oil and wheat flour. Margaret wants to see her business grow bigger and would like to own permanent business

His parents separated 10 years ago; his mother lives in Argentina and his father lives in the city of Huaraz.  Jorge had started to study business administration in an institute in Chiclayo but, due to lack of funds, had to abandon his studies a year and a half ago.  With is grandmother's help he was able to buy a second-hand mototaxi with which he is earning his livelihood.  He works from very early in the morning until well into evening.  This is his only source of income which he uses to defray personal expenses and to help support the family.  Because of the heavy usage and the age of the vehicle, it has begun to have mechanical difficulties but Jorge lacks the funds to make repairs.  For this reason, he has called upon Edpyme Alternativa for his first, 1000 new sol loan, which he will use to service and repair his vehicle.  Jorge wants to finish his studies and set up a vehicle repair shop so that he can continue to get ahead in life and support his loved ones.  He is a very intelligent, responsible and astute young man.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She is 40 years old, married, and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she operates a business of selling fish. She has been engaged in her business for twelve years and earns approximately $188 a month from this activity. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fely joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. She is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to buy a space for her fish vending. This will be her 5th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She buys several quantities of various dried fish at a wholesale price and sells them in retail. Filipinos love to eat dried fish for breakfast and it is eaten best with fried rice. On the side she also makes doormats for added income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her sustain and expand her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan which she will use to buy more quantities of dried fish. She is positive and thankful for the financial help that will be given to her since it will really boost her sales and thus her earnings. \r\n\r\nMarites aims to grow her business in the coming years. She also dreams to provide her children the best education possible for them to have a better future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1689876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy several quantities of dried fish to sell for a profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marites","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":992391,"name":"Fanjaniaina Marie Odette","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"27 ans, Fanjaniaina est une femme tr\u00e8s active,travailleuse et d\u00e9brouillarde.

group. All of the group's members live in the village of Srae Siem in Kampong Chhnang province. She is a farmer; more specifically, she owns a small piece of land where she cultivates rice. On the plantation, she faces serious problems because she does not have enough money to buy rice seeds and fertilizers to maintain her field. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy such seeds and fertilizers. Her husband, Mr. Kum Chea, is a fisherman. Mrs. Kung N. is 49 years old, and she is the mother of five children. One of her children is a shoemaker, two of her children are laborers, and the other two children are currently attending the local school. <p>\r\n\r\nOne member of this village bank loan is seeking an end-of-term (\"EoT\") loan, while the other members are requesting loans whereby regular monthly payments are required. The EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor: it allows the borrower to repay portions of the principal whenever he or she is financially able to do so, meaning that the borrower is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan's term. Even so, most of AMK's clients start making their loan payments many months before the loan's maturity date. Further, nearly all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time; to illustrate, AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva-related loans.

P\u00e1ez is 61 years old and has six children. She lives in the neighbourhood of Villa Gloria which is located in the south west of the city of Barranquilla. It was once a shanty town but now has public services and many bus companies.\r\n\r\nA year ago Fedelina started designing, making, and selling footwear, specializing in shoes for women. She sells them to customers who live in the Urab\u00e1 area and personally delivers the orders to the people who sell the footwear. A colleague looks after the payments and bank deposits. Fedelina also sells in Barranquilla, in her own neighbourhood, and in the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nShe is now asking for a loan of $1,500 to buy materials and supplies to make footwear, such as leather, stick-on soles, and thread because she needs complete her customers\u2019 orders. \r\n\r\nThis is Fedelina\u2019s fifth loan with Kiva parter, the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to which she has belonged for more than three years. With the Foundation\u2019s help, she built up working capital for developing the business, and as a result was able to make improvements to her house. Her dream is to build one place for making the products and another for displaying them. She also wishes for the financial wellbeing of her children and grandchildren through education, and for a greater income from her business. Her most important challenge is to separate the living quarters of the family from the workshop area because the business takes up a lot of space. This creates problems for the family and isn\u2019t good for the children who live there.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

living. She has been in this business for more than 20 years. Norita belongs to a group of young entrepreneurs of Riverside Center in Rizal West Branch (RWB). With the support of ASHI and Kiva lenders of her previous loan, Norita appreciates that the loan has helped her improve own business, build her own house and support the education of her siblings, hence having better living standards. \r\n\r\nCurrently in Norita\u2019s increasing business, she would like to request a second kiva loan in a much larger loan amount to supplement her running capital. Specifically, the loan fund will be used to pay for more inventory for her business, including coconut jam, banana chips, peanut butter, barquillos (wafers), banana fritters, immature rice (pinipig), cashew nuts and other supplies. In the meantime, the profits she makes from her business are saved in preparation for the expense of educating her four children. She hopes that until their graduation from college, she will be able to give them her support financially. \r\n\r\nNorita dreams to have a store in the marketplace and to buy more inventory in the future for better output. She sees herself venturing into a full-fledged wholesale business in the next seven years. With the support of our Kiva supporters, Norita is optimistic that the family business will continue to grow, bring steady profits, and sustain improvements in her family\u2019s quality of life. Her long term goals are to maintain the output of her business, and support the other family business of rental fees (apartment houses) in the local community, and to purchase a new tricycle (three-wheeled-vehicles) for added income. Norita also dreams of brighter future and to bring happiness and harmony into their home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":572901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy

Together they have two children, whom they are bringing up in their own home located in the little village of Casacoto. \n\nFive years ago she began her path in agriculture. Her principal plantings consist of potatoes and oats, which she fertilizes regularly so that she can then sell her crops in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma. But she confirms that the purchase and sale of potatoes is what she likes most. She travels regularly to the coast to sell an average of 10 kilos of seed potatoes each trip. In addition she has the support of her husband, who works as a laborer in different fields, where they pay him a daily rate of 23 PEN, thus obtaining extra earnings to pay for the family expenses and the education of their children. For this reason she is thinking of planting in larger quantities so that they can save and thus open a business in which her life could be more peaceful. \n\nShe belongs to the community bank \"Sembradoras de Casacoto\" (Planters of Casacoto), and this is her third loan with MFP, where she feels grateful for the support that she receives from the members of her association. Ada will invest the money from the loan she is applying for in the purchase of two bulls, which cost an average of 1500 PEN and which she will fatten and sell at a better price, since she has some unused pastures where she can raise them.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":752014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two bulls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-25T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3030.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666010}],"funded_date":"2011-04-25T19:57:54Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":294985,"name":"Sheila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sheila B. is from the village of Estefania, Amulung, Cagayan.

Meet Lawrence. Lawrence is a smallholder farmer based in Eldoret which is a fast-growing agricultural town in North Rift Valley, Kenya. He owns a small piece of land where he stays with his family of two children. On this farm, he keeps poultry and dairy cattle and grows various types of food crops as well. For the last seven years, Lawrence has been selling milk, eggs and crops from his farm to make a decent living. \r\n\r\nLawrence is seeking a loan to purchase a piece of farm transportation equipment locally known as bodaboda. A bodaboda is an Indian motorcycle that has gained so much popularity in all rural areas of Kenya due to its affordable price and low maintenance requirements. Farmers in inaccessible areas rely on bodabodas to transport their produce to the market as well as ferry passengers at a small price. \r\n\r\nYour loan will help Lawrence acquire a means of transport suited for the poor road networks in Sosiani village.
