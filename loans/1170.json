Her sons are married and have left home). Ides was born near La Laguna and grew up with her parents. Her father was a traditional fisherman, and her mother sold her father's fish, as well as other people's fish. Ines learned this job, and with the passing of the years she developed a relationship and had two children. In the end, she was unable to live with her partner and became single again. After some time, she met someone new and is now in a long-term relationship with him. They have been together for 20 years. At one point he emigrated illegally to the United States. They were able to build the home in which they now live, in the northern zone of La Laguna, on land which is owned by the government. It's an area that was created from the hardening of a layer of volcanic lava, and they built their home with the state's permission when her spouse returned from the US. They then opened a small store and started raising chickens in December. They also raise laying hens. In general, they have 200 laying hens. Her spouse works as a security guard at city hall.\r\nThis loan which she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is for the purchase of 300 Hy-line red laying hens, 11 weeks old. They decided to increase the number of animals they have because of demand for their eggs, and they do not have the money to feed them. They buy their chickens in the city and have to pay someone to make the voyage; they pay $20 for each voyage of about 15 kilometres from their home, and then they have to walk, which increases the cost because of the uneven ground leading to their home.\r\nWith this loan, she will have money to buy chicken feed and to satisfy the dietary needs of her current batch of growing chickens. What she makes from 200 hens is not enough to cover the costs of the rest; 200 hens lay about 170-180 eggs per day given their cycles. If they grow well, this group will definitely start to lay at 17 weeks as expected, and production will be homogeneous with healthy and strong animals.\r\nShe hopes to increase production with this new group of 350 chickens, which will replace the 200 hens. She hopes to have a better income for her family because her spouse's salary and their income from their store barely covers their family's costs. Next year, their costs will be higher because their 15-year-old daughter should start high school, and she will have to travel every day. What's more, their 17-year-old daughter is pregnant, and the baby's father is not taking responsibility for the pregnancy. Their 5-year-old granddaughter will have to start kindergarten; next year there will be more costs, so they will have to work harder.\r\nIn the future, Ides hopes to improve the farm equipment, especially the structures. The birds currently live in a laminate house and are entirely closed in with little natural ventilation. One day, she hopes to have special housing for them with hanging water and food dishes, and everything better organized. She hopes that her girls will go to university so that they can live differently."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1383412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

en las edades de 5 a 19 a\u00f1os. En esta ciudad encontr\u00f3 un ambiente propicio para vivir y emprender su propia aventura de negocios, con el cual ha logrado obtener su vivienda y el sostenimiento de su hogar. Cuando se inici\u00f3 como comerciante, lo hizo con una tienda que poco a poco fue ampliando, pero ese negocio lo convirti\u00f3 en refresquer\u00eda, debido a que la tienda demandaba mucha operatividad y esfuerzo y disfrutaba muy poco de su familia y el tiempo le ha dado la raz\u00f3n, pues adem\u00e1s le ha permitido generar ingresos para que sus hijos logren estudiar y esto para el y su c\u00f3nyuge es muy importante.

Con los financiamientos de la Fundaci\u00f3n ha logrado adquirir activos fijos como sus enfriadores y surtir su negocio efectivamente, con lo cual su clientela siempre encuentra lo que necesita y esto le ha convenido porque ha logrado fidelizarlos. Su meta mas adelante es adquirir un local propio y ampliar su mercado para incrementar sus utilidades y en un futuro lograr el cumplimiento de su sue\u00f1o familiar de bienestar. \nCon su  credito  pasados compr\u00f3 refrescos y bebidas que aumentaron sus inventarios y generaron mayores utilidades. Con sus ganancias en el negocio, ha logrado fortalecer el ahorro y adquirir su propia casa, adem\u00e1s de que su hija  est\u00e9 estudiando una carrera universitaria.

He has done this since arriving in the department of Cesar 17 years ago looking for a way to bring his family peace and well-being. His family is his wife and their four children between the ages of 5 and 19. In this city he has found a favourable environment in which to live and launch his own business venture. With his business, he has been able to obtain a home and sustain his family. When he started off as a businessman, he had a store which he expanded bit by bit. He has turned this business into a refreshment stall because the store required a lot of labour and hard work, and he was not able to enjoy his family very much because he had no time. This refreshment stall has allowed him to generate an income so that his children can study; this is very important for him and his partner. He is currently applying for a Kiva loan, his ninth loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, Pedro will buy pop, national drinks, juice, and beer wholesale and with cash. This will allow him to stock up and have a good inventory to get through the permanent price increases of these products. This is why his loan will be a successful investment. It will allow him to save by getting special prices based on volume. He anticipates that the prices on the products he sells most will increase.\r\nWith his loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n, he has been able to acquire fixed assets such as his freezers, and to stock his business effectively. Because of this, his customers always find what they need; this has been good for Pedro, because he has ensured their loyalty. His goal for the future is to acquire a proper storefront and to expand his market in order to increase his income. He hopes to achieve his dream of familial well-being in the future.\r\nWith his previous loans he bought pop and drinks, which increased his inventory and generated greater utilities. With his income from his business, he has been able to strengthen his savings and acquire his own home. What's more, his daughter is studying in university. \r\nHe is now applying for a new loan with which he will reinforce his stock with greater volumes of beer and pop. These are the products in highest demand and they rotate easily. He is very satisfied and tells the Kiva lenders: \"Thank you so much for your confidence and support.\""}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1383414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a larger quantity of beer and pop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-07-05T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-04T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1570000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78134},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86758},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89361},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":92042},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94803},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":97647},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100576},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":103594},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106701},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":109902},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":113200},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":116596},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":120093},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":123696},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":136897}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":579648,"name":"Allah Rakhi's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allah Rakhi is a 46-year-old housewife who lives in Lahore, Pakistan.

","en":"Odiljon is a 46-year old man with an optimistic, positive life outlook. He is married and has three children. He and his family live in the rural area. Odiljoin has graduated from  the university with a degree in architecture. Now he works as an architect for his region\u2019s administration. His wife is a homemaker: she is a good wife and caring mother. Every day she takes care of the household needs, takes care of the children and bringing them up. Odiljoin needs to work a lot in order to support his family. Sometimes he works late at night in order to finish his projects. Even though this work brings in a good income, this is insufficient to provide for all the family needs. He also would like to improve the house they live in. His house has been in use for many years, and is now in a bad condition and needs  major renovations. But renovations require a lot of expenses and financial means. This is way Odiljon has applied to Arvand for a loan to buy construction materials to renovate his home. He is really hoping for a positive decision and also thanks Arvand in advance for its support.

Parizat's husband helps her in her business. Thanks to Parizat and her husband's persistent work, today they have a good business: 200 sheep and milking cows. They also have 4.34 hectares of irrigated land available, where they mainly grow beans. The income made it possible for Parizat to multiply the number of livestock on the farm and thereby increase the well-being of the family.\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Parizat turned to our microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of six sheep. Parizat plans to invest the income from the loan in her children's education, and also to build a new house. The family is very friendly and ambitious."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1383800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

grandchildren. She has higher education. She worked as veterinary for a period of 16 years. \r\n\r\nIn 1990 Faniya started with livestock breeding together with her family. The livestock breeding business was started with 25,000 som (KGS). Faniya's husband helps with the business. Thanks to Faniya's persistent work and her education as a veterinary, the farm today has two dairy cows and one calf. Further they have 1.40 hectares of land available, on which she plants clover every year. The harvest is used as fodder for the livestock. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Faniya turned to our microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of steers.

with many children - she has four.  Her husband helps her with the business.  She started her business with the market in 2007.  She sells vegetables and fruits at the local market.  She started the business with 5,000 som and expanded her goods turnover.  Cholpon is very hardworking; she pulls her family financially, and the children are small.  Thanks to her hard work and persistence, today her product turnover amounts to 20,000 som, which yields a good profit to her family, in the amount of 15,000 som.  In order to increase product turnover, Cholpon requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to purchase fruits and vegetables for resale.  She plans to use the earnings from the loan to buy furniture for home and to live well.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1383782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his wife and children in the Bilasuvar  IDP Settlement. He is a Jabrayili refugee. Elchin has been breeding cattle for the last seven years. After several attempts to find a job, he gave up and decided to start his business. With the help of his wife, they purchased their first cattle.\r\n\r\nElchin usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them for five or six months and then sells them for a more profitable price in the livestock bazaar. His monthly income is 140 AZN and this business is only one source of financial income in his family. Beef is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes like pilau and dolma.

She sells her products for cash or on credit both to regular customers and passers-by.  She is a street vendor and, on some occasions, she sells her products from her home.  Julia started her business in order to cover some household costs.  She has fought to get her children ahead and to provide them with a better future.  One of her dreams is to improve her home and give her children a decent place to live.  This loan will be used to invest in working capital and to stock-up her business buying and selling merchandise, such as make-up, clothing items for adults and children, and more.  Julia is very grateful to Kiva lenders for their support to people of low financial resources."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1380002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Se cas\u00f3 muy joven y tuvo dos hijos a quienes tuvo que educarlos sola despu\u00e9s de que sufri\u00f3 el abandono de su esposo hace 13 a\u00f1os de quien no volvi\u00f3 a saber nada y este acontecimiento le llev\u00f3 a aprender varias actividades en el \u00e1rea comercial para buscar el sustento de su hogar. Ernestina al poco tiempo de haberse casado con quien ahora es su ex esposo; se traslad\u00f3 a la ciudad de Quito capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador en donde se encuentran muchas personas migrantes de las diferentes provincias del pa\u00eds que han llegado hasta all\u00ed en busca de nuevas oportunidades. Ernestina vive en Quito en la parroquia de Yaruqu\u00ed, ubicada en la periferia del cant\u00f3n, que guarda en su historia grandes tesoros de los antepasados incas que habitaron el lugar. En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os la parroquia ha crecido y las viviendas se han multiplicado pero cabe destacar que las actividades que se realizan con mayor vocaci\u00f3n son las flor\u00edcolas y av\u00edcolas sin dejar de lado las actividades industriales, de comercio y servicios en especial el turismo, actividad con la cual se muestra a turistas nacionales y extranjeros los lugares donde habitaban los incas, una pir\u00e1mide significativa y una gruta que lleva a un santuario. \nErnestina se dedica desde hace 2 a\u00f1os a la comercializaci\u00f3n de ropa casual para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os; labor que la aprendi\u00f3 por sugerencia de un familiar y comenz\u00f3 vendiendo de puerta a puerta a sus amigos y conocidos, actualmente esta mujer se ha superado a s\u00ed misma logrando establecer su negocio en un peque\u00f1o local en el pasillo de su casa y al cual le dedica hasta 10 horas cada d\u00eda. Actualmente la variedad de productos que tiene ha reducido, para lo cual solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra exclusiva de ropa de temporada para todas las edades, el beneficio adicional que ella obtendr\u00e1 ser\u00e1 un descuento mayor al acostumbrado, pues al comprar mercader\u00eda en mayor cantidad le otorgan un mejor precio con lo que obtendr\u00e1 utilidades mayores, las cuales usar\u00e1 en el mejoramiento de su estilo de vida y adem\u00e1s ayudar a su hijo que a\u00fan vive con ella en la obtenci\u00f3n de su t\u00edtulo profesional. Esta mujer encontr\u00f3 en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa el apoyo, asesor\u00eda y confianza que estaba esperando para dar el paso de crecimiento en su negocio. ","en":"Ernestina is 41 and was born and raised in a chilly rural town in northern Ecuador. She married very young and had two children, whom she had to educate on her own as her husband disappeared 13 years ago. Ernestina never heard from her husband again and learned various businesses in an attempt to support her children.  \r\n\r\nShortly after she married her now ex-husband, the couple moved to Quito, the Ecuadorean capital. They were among many migrants from across the country who came to Quito seeking new opportunities. Ernestina lives in Yaruqu\u00ed Parish, on the outskirts of Quito, a region rich with treasures left by the Inca people who lived there. In recent years, Yaruqu\u00ed Parish has grown, with burgeoning  construction of new homes. The major economic activities, however, are still flower and poultry production, though commercial and industrial ventures, and especially tourism, are also significant. Tourists from Ecuador and abroad come to see where the Incas lived, a magnificent pyramid, and a cave that leads to a shrine.  \r\n\r\nErnestina has for two years sold casual clothes for men, women, and children. She learned the business at the suggestion of a family member and began selling door-to-door to friends and neighbors. Ernestina eventually gave up selling door-to-door and set up a shop in her home, where she works ten hours a day. She currently carries a smaller variety of clothes than she used to, and she is requesting a loan for the exclusive purchase of seasonal clothing for adults and children.

She works selling secondhand footwear such as shoes, sports shoes, sandals and others. She sells her products from a location she rents, and she always waits on her customers with a kind smile. She started selling only secondhand items, but with time she increased her working capital and now she also sells new footwear. She has been working at this business for four years now, and she would like to continue working at it for many more. She considers her business a success because of the profits she receives from it and because she has many repeat customers.

Her father gave her a half-hectare of land where she starting to cultivate cocoa and fruit trees.  At first, she didn't have enough money to hire workers or to replace the various trees on their land that were not producing.  A relative provided her with small loans to solve the problems that she had.  Over the years, she managed through her earnings to buy another parcel of land where she expanded her cocoa plantings and thereby progressively increased her income.  She frequently hires workers from the area who assist her with the weeding and the harvest of her cocoa beans.  \r\n\r\nOver time, with her earnings, she wants to improve her house and rebuild it with bricks and cement so that she can improve her family's quality of life.  This is her first loan with Kiva, and she feels grateful for the financial support that she is receiving that will help her to continue to make progress.  In addition, she promises to make her payments on time.  She wants to borrow 1,000 Peruvian soles to buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1383972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-07-06T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-05T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":97.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":99.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":107.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":107.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":114.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":117.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.27,"local_amount":78.04,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":81.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997393},{"amount":34.27,"local_amount":91.41,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":95.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864857},{"amount":32.8,"local_amount":87.45,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":91.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353224},{"amount":36.49,"local_amount":97.3,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904990},{"amount":37.68,"local_amount":100.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-24T09:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":104.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090991},{"amount":37.21,"local_amount":99.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-28T09:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":103.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777593},{"amount":40.16,"local_amount":107.07,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":111.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598054},{"amount":40.4,"local_amount":107.75,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-03T09:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":112.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147358},{"amount":42.8,"local_amount":114.14,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-09T09:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":119.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240547},{"amount":43.92,"local_amount":117.11,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-01T11:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":122.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258105}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T16:44:51Z","paid_date":"2015-01-01T11:11:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":579864,"name":"Matilda's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Matilda is married and 43.

She is married with one child aged 14 years, and she has two additional dependents who live with her because they are relatives. In 2001, Umu established her grocery store business. She began her business because she needed to contribute in supporting the home. She works at the business every day, 12 hours per day. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nUmu requires a loan in order to buy more ketchup, baby food, mayonnaise, and assorted drinks. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business so she can attract customers and improve her family's standard of living. In the future, Umu plans to import her goods from a neighboring country. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1383339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She is married with 3 children between the ages of 3 years and 15 years, and has 2 additional dependents that live with her because they are relatives. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Saffie established her cosmetics business. She began her business because she needed to create income to support her home. She works at the business 7 days per week and 8 hours per day. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and sometimes sales are very slow.\r\n\r\nSaffie requires a loan in order to buy more body cream, soap, baby power, and perfume to sell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business so she can attract customers and improve her family's standard of living. In the future, Saffie plans to import her goods from a neighboring country. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1383367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She is married to Emilio and they have 5 children who live with them in a house they own, made out of wood. Zenobia makes a living growing cocoa and other products native to her region. Together with her husband, she works on a plot of land of 2.5 hectares that is their principal source of income. Zenobia learned how to farm when she was very young because her parents also made a living in this way. When she became an adult, she got married and since then has worked alongside her husband, who was able to buy the plot of land they now possess.\r\n\r\nZenobia's principal objective from the beginning of the planting season has been to keep her crops in good condition and in compliance with organic certification requirements. This way she will be able to harvest them without problems and sell the products to recover the money she invested plus some extra profit. In order to improve the quality of the harvests she used to have, Zenobia uses organic fertilizer on her soil. She also used to hire local workers who helped her to complete all of the labor of weeding and other tasks that can be overwhelming.

Victoria makes her living in agriculture on 2 acres of farm land she inherited from her father where she has grows cocoa and other products that go in to making bread. To earn good profits from her work she needs to grow a good quality of her produce by the end of the season, which is why she frequently purchases organic fertilizer. \r\n\r\nShe likes her work very much because she considers it very calm and she can recover the money invested by selling her products to the wholesalers in the area. When it rains it complicates her work because she cannot move around her land as easily because of the mud which prevents her from getting work done like normal.

She is married to Arnel, a driver, and she is a mother. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nUrsula maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer, and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers earn as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business.\r\n\r\nUrsula dreams of becoming successful in her business, and hopes to help her family financially. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and she also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship, and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":994061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional supplies and merchandise: products like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-07-06T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-05T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ursula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":280,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12132.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534887},{"amount":186.67,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8088.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784281},{"amount":186.66,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8088.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771268},{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2022.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824318}],"funded_date":"2013-07-07T03:43:50Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T13:11:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":579969,"name":"Lucia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucia is 60 years old and married with three children.\r\n\r\nLucia works hard to provide for her family.

He lives with his family in his house, which is made of wood.  Jaimer is a farmer who cultivates cocoa on his farmlands.  This activity is his main source of income.  During the last harvest season various pests affected his cocoa crops, and this prevented him from getting very good earnings.  He thinks that the best way to deal with this pest, in most cases, is to replace the plants and constantly monitor the crops.

Now, she is able to earn about KHR 25,000 per day. \r\n\r\nThis is not the first loan for VisionFund Cambodia (Kiva\u2019s partner). She has fully repaid her past loan with success and it has enabled her to promptly support her business and upgrade her lifestyle, one step ahead. \r\n\r\nNow, in a group of four, she is the leader. Nory and two other fellow group members are seeking KHR 1,000,000 each, while a remaining member is applying for KHR 800,000. \r\n\r\nFor Nory, who leads this group, she will spend her loan portion to buy good ginger seedlings and fragrant rice seeds for replanting. Moreover, she will use a portion of it to buy potash to boost her cash-crop productivity. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this purchase will help her to grow her crops on-time and produce a good

tried to enroll in a drafting course at Houston\u2019s Technical Institute. However, the class was full, and fate led him to sign up for a class in the \u201celectrical trades.\u201d The class was very hands-on from the first day, and Charlton discovered that he loved working with circuit boards. This experience began Charlton\u2019s lifelong passion for electronics. He went on to have a 33-year career working for power companies like Dyna Electric and the San Onofre power plant. \r\n\r\nWith the most recent recession, Charlton struggled as there was little work for electricians. In an effort to reinvent himself, Charlton took marketing and drafting classes at a San Diego community college. He also set up a cleaning business, but found the hours grueling and the work unrewarding. \r\n\r\nCharlton finally chose to return to the trade that he deeply values. In 2009, rather than seeking employment, he decided to take control of his own destiny and obtained his independent contractor license. He started Light Duty Electric, an electrical services business in Oceanside, California, and as the construction industry began to recover, business quickly picked up.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Charlton works 14 to 16 hours a day and takes pride in the skills he has honed. He has a reputation as an honest and skilled electrician. Charlton commits to providing customers with quality electrical work and to paying vendors in a timely manner. As his business grows, he plans to use his Kiva loan to pay for electrical materials and to help maintain a consistent cash flow.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to eventually be able to grow his business to the point where he can hire employees and purchase additional trucks, passing on both his expert skill and excellent work ethic.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1383420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a mother of two children. Her husband owns and runs a fruit shop in the market which is the family's only source of income. He sells apples, bananas and oranges in his shop. He is interested in offering more variety to his customers which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However due to the lack of income he finds it difficult. Therefore his wife Asiya, as a member of a three person group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at profitable price. With the profit her husband wants to grow his business in the future. Asiya is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1383607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits

Their principal economic activity is agriculture and raising animals, and some work in the city in various workplaces.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Maria Rosa, who is now in her third loan cycle, along with her friends and fellow group members from Camino al Progreso, a group that she likes a lot, since she shares good moments with her neighbors, leaves the routine of her work, and at the same time learns from the educational talks that they receive.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Maria Rosa is 43 years old. She is married, and she and her husband have five children, ages 23, 21, 18, 15, and 12. Her oldest, a daughter, works and helps her economically. Her second child, a son, is married and lives independently. Her next two children work but only for their personal expenses, and her last son lives at home. Her husband works as a bricklayer. The house where they live is their own.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Maria Rosa works in agriculture. What she harvests is for the household consumption, and she sells what is left. She also raises chickens, pigs, and guinea pigs.\r\n\r\nShe is going to invest her loan in the purchase of chickens, guinea pigs, and construction materials to make a bigger chicken coop.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to grow in her animal-raising business.\r\n\r\nThe little photo is of two members who were not able to be present when the group photo was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":1384051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens, guinea pigs, and construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-07-07T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-06T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Trancito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4685.78,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":390.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":390.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":783.33,"local_amount":780.96,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":783.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566755},{"amount":783.33,"local_amount":780.96,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":783.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815773},{"amount":783.33,"local_amount":780.96,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":783.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410965984},{"amount":1174.99,"local_amount":1171.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1174.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857720},{"amount":783.33,"local_amount":780.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":783.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506104},{"amount":391.69,"local_amount":390.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":391.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439729894}],"funded_date":"2013-07-30T17:04:27Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:08:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":580063,"name":"Lonie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lonie is 52 years old and married with one child in school.

Over these years of hard work Ayvaz currently runs a beautiful and profitable farm. He lives with his son and wife who run the farming business with him. Currently Ayvaz keeps on his farm 2 cows, 34 sheep, and 20 chickens. The family also owns a plot of land where different types of trees are cultivated (peach, apricot, apple, nut and pear).\r\n\r\nTogether with agriculture, Ayvaz also works as a driver, but unfortunately the salary he gets is hardly enough for covering basic needs. Ayvaz sells the gathered agricultural products in the local market and earns income which is vital for covering the family's daily needs.

For the last many days, his rickshaw has not been working properly and because of this, he is unable to generate any income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Sajida has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing his rickshaw. This will help him to continue his work and generate income.

She sells the meat in the central bazaar, where the demand for meat is high. People in Azerbaijan consume meat a lot, because it is used in most dishes. Some traditional meals like kebabs, dolma and others require beef in their preparation. Her profit is 130 AZN monthly. Ulkar is applying for a new loan of 1,900 AZN, in order to expand the business by buying new calves. She plans to grow these calves, fatten them and sell more meat, for the coming traditional holidays, when the demand for beef will increase.

Maia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to traditional credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this loan, Maia will purchase milk cows.
