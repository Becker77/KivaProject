She lives in the Kutaisi district, West Georgia, with her husband and retired mother in-law. Tamar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected every time because of her low income and the family's poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nTamara's brother is working abroad and he is sending transfers to the family. Their additional income is Tamar's mother-in-law's monthly pension.\r\n\r\nTamar requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Tamar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit Tamar will purchase furniture for her newly renovated apartment and rent it out. The apartment that Tamar owns is in Batumi district. As Batumi district is very crowded with tourists Tamar will easily rent out her apartment at a good price. This will give her an opportunity to increase the family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

His loan requests were rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have two milk cows and a plot of agricultural land. The cows are milked every day to produce dairy products. On the land fruit trees are grown. Harvested products together with dairy are sold at the local markets. The family gets small monthly income from agriculture, but it is rarely enough to cover their monthly expenses.\r\n\r\nTariel requested loan from Credo to start a family business. Tariel has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Tariel will purchase a car. He will drive it as a taxi himself. Tariel is a very hardworking man. He wants to improve his family's living conditions and for this he will work long hours. He will be driving local people and earning additional income for the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Givi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Ivane requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of his low income and the family's poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nIvane is working as an artisan at the local road building company. His family has three milk cows and they also own plot of land, where apple trees and garlic are grown. The cows are milked every day to produce cheese. The harvested products and cheese are sold at the local market.\r\n\r\nIvane requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ivane has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Ivane will purchase a mini-bus. He will start trading in fruits and vegetables.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Aleksandre has a shop. He sells detergents and hygiene products. Aleksandre is purchasing everything at the wholesale price and sells with the price mark up to earn a small monthly income, which is the only source of living for the family.\r\n\r\nAleksandre requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Aleksandre has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Aleksandre will increase the stock of products for his shop. He wants to have more varieties of detergents and hygiene products to offer better choice to his clients. His shop is already well known among the villagers and with the increased varieties of products he will attract even more customers. Aleksandre will try his best to increase the family income, in order to provide a better life for his wife and son.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1381977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To increase the stock of products for his shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Akhaltsikhe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-07T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-06T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aleksandre ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":126.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":126.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":129.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":137.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":134.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":139.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":140.35},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":144.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":146.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":149.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":153.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":155.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":159.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":161.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":164.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":169.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":171.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":175.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":178.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":181.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.18},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":580167,"name":"Clarina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of three children, Clarina works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business buying and selling ready-to-wear in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from prepaid mobile loading.

She lives on the outskirts of Kyotera town with her family. Four of her children are still attending school.\r\nJesca is a member of Basooka Kwavula Kisuula group, which has eight members comprised of five women and three men. She has been in this group from the beginning and this is her third cycle where she has so far acquired loans of UGX.300,000, 400,000 and 600,000 respectively. She will use this particular loan to buy organic fertilizers for her coffee plants. She hopes it will be able to increase her yields.  She is a farmer who deals in agriculture, specifically coffee growing.  She supplements her income with baking cakes, which she sells in nearby markets. She sells her products to people in rural settings. She has been in these businesses since 1990.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Meri will start trading on clothes and bed clothing.

She lives in a small village in the Senaki district in Nosiri with her husband and retired mother in-law. Tsitsino requested loans from local financial institutions several times for the family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agriculture. They have two milk cows, two calves, a pig, and a plot of land where vegetables are grown. The cows are milked every day to produce cheese. From the pig they sell piglets. The family members are very hard-working people, and they all are involved in their agriculture. The harvested products and cheese are sold at the local Senaki market. As the family has a refugee status, they get an additional income from local government institutions. \r\n\r\nTsitsino requested a loan from Credo to start-up the family business. Tsitsino has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Tsitsino will start trading clothes.

The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with flexible conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products. The rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Temur will renovate a commercial space and purchase groceries to open a grocery shop. Temur and his family members will work in the shop to decrease expenses and increase profit. Part of the profit will be used to expand the business and purchase a greater variety products to better satisfy the clients' needs. The new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the family's living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1383848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to renovate a commercial space and purchase groceries to open a grocery shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Akhuti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-07T23:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-06T23:00:13Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Temur ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":103.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":111.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":112.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":115.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":121.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":120.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":123.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":129.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130.98},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":139.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":143.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":145.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":149.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":152.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Li","image":null}},{"id":580260,"name":"Dafrosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dafrosa is a 30-year-old married woman.

He lives in Tsageri district with his wife and retired mother. Vakhtang requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nVakhtang is working as a welder on private orders and earns 350 Lari per month. They also rent a room in their house. Additional income for the family comes from Vakhtang\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n\r\nVakhtang requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Vakhtang has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Vakhtang will renovate more rooms in their house to rent them out.

The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover on behalf of the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping.

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. It is located close to the Ugandan border, and Mount Elgon, an extinct volcano, which straddles the two nations and even has a peak at the Kenya-Uganda border. Founded by European settlers in the early 1900s, Kitale originally grew due to its proximity to the Ugandan railway, which has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years. The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover by the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping. Kitale is the headquarters of the Kenya Seed Company, whose massive sunflower plantations provide nearby bees with a veritable buffet of high-quality forage. \r\n\r\nBetty is married and has four children. Her husband works as a teacher, while she farms their land. She is currently nurturing a tree plantation, and growing maize, vegetables and sugarcane.

The living conditions there are a bit difficult due to the high rate of crime, few bathrooms, filthy conditions, over population, but the most interesting part is that the rooms and food are a bit cheaper, there is the option of traveling, and contains one of the biggest markets in Liberia. \r\n   \r\nLimic is married, and her husband works as a secretary at his office. They have five children, whose ages are between 32 and 18; only two of their children are currently attending school and live at home. Limic completed grade 11 before starting a cook shop business that sells rice and soup in the market of New Kru Town. With the loan proceeds, she will buy more stock (rice, pepper, oil, dry fish, dry meat, onion, vita, etc.) to have enough food ingredients in stock. She said, \"Besides fewer goods on my table market, I have no other problems for now\". With a little money from her mother she managed to establish this business, and she learned by observing other cook shop businesswomen twenty-five years ago. She stated, \"I enjoy the flow of costumers, and they boast of the food I prepare saying it\u2019s delicious!\"  Her dreams are to move from a cook shop business to a Restaurant business, build a house, and live a better life in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1383900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This left Trans-Nzoia one of Kenya\u2019s most cosmopolitan areas, with individuals from a variety of linguistic and ethnic groups living in close proximity. The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflower, sugar cane, millet, and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, the oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano in East Africa. Its proximity to the dense Mount Elgon forest, as well as other neighboring forests, makes it a high-potential beekeeping region. \r\n\r\nBeatrice is married, and has five children. Her husband works as a technician for the Nzoia Water Company, while she farms their land; she is currently growing maize, bananas and beans. She is excited to work with Honey Care because \"they are professionals in the industry and I have no doubt in my mind that this project they have initiated will be successful.\" She is also interested in starting beekeeping because \"I love honey and the money from honey will push me a long way.\"\r\n\r\nThis is Beatrice's first loan, and she plans to use the income generated by her hives to pay school fees for her five children.

Living conditions there are bit difficult due to the high rate of crime, fewer bathrooms, filthy conditions, and overpopulation, but the most interesting part is that rooms are a bit cheaper, there is the option of traveling, it contains one of the biggest markets in Liberia, and has lower prices on food.\r\n\r\n34-year-old Lorpu is married. Her husband works as driver at his office, and they both have five children between 10 and 2. Only three of her children are currently attending school and live at home. Lorpu was unfortunately unable to attend school, but she is busy running her shop which sells charcoal in the market of New Kru Town. With the loan proceeds she will buy more pepper, oil, beans, peanut, etc. for her business. She said; beside fewer goods on my table at the market, I have no other problem for now. With a little money from her mother she managed to established this business fifteen years ago, and learned by seeing other businesswomen. She stated; I enjoy the flows of customers and the fast buying. Her dreams are to move from the charcoal business to a store business, and live a better life in future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1383922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict

","en":"Muniskhon is the beloved mother of three grown children and a homemaker. She is 44 years old. She is married; her husband is a migrant worker in Russia. Difficult economic conditions forced her husband to become a migrant worker and earn a living abroad. Muniskhon takes care of the household on her own. She has operated a business for over four years. She began her business selling women's clothing, and now sells children's clothing, as the demand for it is greater than for women's. Muniskhon runs the business herself, and is the sole provider for the family. She spends all her money on food products.

She is married and has four wonderful children. They all live together in a large house. The children help their parents some. Lutfiniso has since childhood always worked to earn the money she needs. Even now, no longer a young woman, she is running her own business. The business is bringing her a steady income, which helps meet her needs. Lutfiniso sells consumer goods, as she has been for over 20 years. She buys various goods at a wholesale market and brings them to sell in her village. She has a small store there to sell the goods. Her husband also helps with the business. He used to work on a farm, but has decided to focus solely on helping his wife expand her business. The business brings them a good income, and if they expand their inventory, they can do even better. That is why Lutfiniso wants to buy more goods and expand the business.

","en":"Saidmurod is 48 years old, and lives in the J. Rumy district. He has a large family: he is married and has five children. Saidmurod, as the head of the family, wants to provide good living conditions for the family and provide his children with an education. To do this he is planning to start an income generating business - sheep husbandry. Sheep breeding is only weakly impacted by market swings because wool is always needed by consumers. Sheep cheese is also highly valued, as it is considered very healthy since it is not fatty and has many nutrients. Additionally lamb meat is considered a choice delicacy, and many restaurants showcase their lamb dishes. The first offspring of a ewe can be sold at 8-9 months, and the lamb gains weight fairly quickly. Saidmurod has a good place for keeping and breeding sheep. He plans to buy four, and after a month of feeding them, sell them at the local market for a profit. To reach that goal, Saidmurod is asking for a loan.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result for better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nClarita dreams that her business will continue to be successful and hopes to have their own house and lot. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Now Aziz wants to buy more merchandise for sale because the demand for his merchandise is increasing, especially according to seasons.  This is why he needs money, and he came to Arvand to obtain this loan to purchase men's clothing for sale.

Kristine requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have a pig and a milk cow, whose milk is made into cheese products. Besides that, they have a 1.3 hectare plot of agricultural land, where maize is grown. They sell piglets, cheese and harvested maize at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKristine requested a loan from Credo to start-up family business. Kristine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Kristine will begin to buy and sell fruits and vegetables. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

A este hombre lo conocen en la comunidad por su sencillez y solidaridad con todos quienes le rodean. Elio vive con su esposa en el Cant\u00f3n de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. Los productos agr\u00edcolas m\u00e1s comercializados son granos como arveja, fr\u00e9jol, lenteja, haba y tambi\u00e9n varias frutas y verduras. La producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados abastece la distribuci\u00f3n interna y el excedente se env\u00eda a la Regi\u00f3n Costa en productos ya procesados. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nLa agricultura y ganader\u00eda ha sido la labor de Elio durante toda su vida, tiene algunas vacas a las cuales cuida y adem\u00e1s le producen leche para la posterior venta, actividad a la cual le dedica al menos cuatro horas cada d\u00eda. Su esposa siempre le ayudaba con esta actividad adem\u00e1s de los quehaceres del hogar, sin embargo un evento fortuito de hace poco ha dejado a su esposa enferma y sin poder realizar sus actividades normales, pues al sufrir una ca\u00edda su columna fue afectada y el dolor y malestar han permanecido desde ese d\u00eda, es por esto que Elio ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual podr\u00e1 hacer atender a Tomasa con un especialista que le ayude con este inconveniente y adem\u00e1s para cubrir los medicamentos que eso conlleve, y as\u00ed mejorar su calidad de vida, pues la enfermedad en s hogar le roba tiempo que en d\u00edas normales es muy productivo. Elio agradece la apertura y sensibilidad de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes le dan la oportunidad de obtener este cr\u00e9dito a trav\u00e9s de los prestamistas de Kiva de quienes \u00e9l est\u00e1 seguro tambi\u00e9n conseguir\u00e1 el apoyo necesario. ","en":"Elio is a 63-year-old adult who grew up in the countryside and when he completed elementary school started working in the fields with his family.  Later, he married Tomasa who is now 57-years-old when he was very young.  They had children who all live independently now each with their own respective families.\r\n\r\nThis man is very well-known in his community because of his unaffectedness and solidarity with all who surround him.  Elio lives with his wife in Salcedo Canton located in the east of Cotopaxi, one of Ecuador\u2019s mountain region\u2019s most important provinces.\r\n\r\nSalcedo has several tourist attractions like lagoons and bathing resorts where tourists can enjoy extreme sports.  However, the main activity that\u2019s carried out in this town is agriculture and to a lesser degree, cattle raising.  The most common agricultural products are grains like peas, broad beans, lentils and lima beans as well as several fruits and vegetables.  Milk production and its derivatives meet local demand and any excess is sent to the Costa Region as already processed products.  Raising animals is also very favorable because of the canton\u2019s climate.  Despite these productive activities, there are worrying rates of illiteracy and poverty due to unmet basic needs like sewer service which is only available in 25% of homes.\r\n\r\nAgriculture and animal husbandry have been Elio\u2019s life\u2019s work.  He owns some cows he cares for that produce milk for subsequent sale; he spends at least four hours per day in this activity.  His wife used to always help him with this activity and also did the household chores.  However, an unfortunate recent event left his wife ill and unable to do her normal activities because having fallen she suffered an injury to her spinal column and the pain and discomfort persist to this day.  Because of this, Elio has requested a loan to be able to take Tomasa to a specialist who can help her with this inconvenience and also to pay for any medicine that this may require thus improving her quality of life because illness at home robs them of time that under normal circumstances is very productive.\r\n\r\nElio is grateful for the openness and sensibility of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who provide him with the opportunity of obtaining this loan by means of Kiva lenders from whom he\u2019s sure to also get the required support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1384636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for his wife's medical treatments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salcedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-08T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-07T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":684.59,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":60.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":67.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":70.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":72.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.1,"local_amount":60.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":62.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565425},{"amount":64.89,"local_amount":63.46,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":64.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814462},{"amount":66.28,"local_amount":64.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":66.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320635},{"amount":80.64,"local_amount":78.86,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":80.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856324},{"amount":72.06,"local_amount":70.47,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":72.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059900},{"amount":71.25,"local_amount":69.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":71.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995236},{"amount":70.2,"local_amount":68.65,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":70.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413673},{"amount":59.95,"local_amount":58.64,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:12Z","rounded_local_amount":59.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102315},{"amount":75.66,"local_amount":73.99,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":75.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212207},{"amount":76.97,"local_amount":75.28,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":76.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138214}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T17:13:35Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:19:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":580883,"name":"Cipriana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

is 33 years old. He lives in Akhmeta District with his wife. They run a small-scale agricultural business and grow different kinds of vegetables which are used by the family. The only source of income for the family is a small income earned by Aleksi, working locally as an auto mechanic. \r\n\r\nSeveral times, Aleksi requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nAleksi requested a loan from Credo to restart-up a trading business and to set up a store where auto parts and accessories will be sold. Aleksi was in this business seven years ago and has enough experience in this field. \r\n\r\nHe has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high-risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Aleksi will purchase stocks of auto parts and sell them from his store to local drivers. Thanks to this loan, Aleksi will have his own lucrative business and his life, as well as his wife\u2019s, will be considerably improved.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1384216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to restart his business and set up an auto parts store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Akhmeta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-08T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-07T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aleksi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":169.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":175.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":176.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":182.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":182.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":186.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":196.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":193.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":199.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":206.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":208.46},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":212.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":217.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":220.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":225.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":228.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":233},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":239.59},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":241.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":246.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":255.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":580281,"name":"Kayi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Accoucheuse de profession, Kayi pour subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins revend aussi des bois de chauffage depuis 2009 \u00e0 domicile.

","en":"Hakim is 51 and lives in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. He has a loving wife and three caring daughters. His wife is a homemaker and does not work. As head of the household, Hakim provides for his family and has worked many different jobs over the years so that his family would not lack for anything. Now his daughters are grown up and ready to get married. He should already be saving up for their weddings. Hakim went to a vocational high school and has driving experience.

children (two sons and one daughter).  She has a secondary-specialized education.  She is an accountant-cashier.  She has also been involved in farming and animal husbandry since 1998.  She has a lot of experience in these business areas.  She started the business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Nurila's husband helps her with the household.  To-date, she was able to develop her farming business, and the monthly profit from the business amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).

Aleksi\u2019s wife works as a local school principal and receives a monthly salary.  Aleksi has made multiple loan requests, without success, from the local financial institutions in order to start up a trading business.  His loan requests were rejected each time due to low income.  \r\n\r\nAleksi\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions.  Borrowers are the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u2018high-risk borrowers\u2019 because of their low income.  With the received credit, Aleksi will purchase basic groceries and set up a store.  He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually.  \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.  Aleksi will work hard, and he will be able to improve the living conditions for his family.  With this loan, his family will generate enough income to access regular credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event that they need it.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1384260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Akhmeta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-08T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-07T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aleksi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":220.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":225.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":230.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":240.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":241.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":251.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":252.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":258.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":275.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":270.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":280.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":283.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":292.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":296.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":303.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":312.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":317.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":327.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":332.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":340.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":351.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":356.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":365.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":372.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Vacha","image":1668411}},{"id":579165,"name":"Marcos Tulio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marcos de 37 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposa y sus dos hijos, el tiene un taller de enderezado y pintura desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, su negocio lo tiene ubicado en su lugar de residencia, tiene mucha clientela pues su trabajo lo realiza muy bien, es muy responsable y amable, con las ganancias que obtiene de su trabajo logra cubrir algunos gastos de su hogar, marcos est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar materiales como: pinturas, barniz, pulidoras, etc. y poder seguir con su negocio para poderle dar a su familia una mejor estabilidad econ\u00f3mica.","en":"Marcos is a 37-year-old man who lives in his own house with his wife and two children.

People from that town work in agriculture and raising cattle.  \r\n\r\nThis loan is her first sequence in the institution and Vicenta will use it to buy a dairy cow; she wants to take advantage of this opportunity.  Her reason for requesting the loan is that she does not have money for the purchase which will be of great benefit to her because a good amount of milk will be produced and she will then be able to make more cheese and milk and improve her income.  \r\n\r\nThe business challenge Vicenta faces is forage that must be purchased every so often.

She has secondary education. After finishing high school, Ayat got married. She works as an operator at a gas station. Her husband works with providing passengers services to the public. \r\n\r\nSince 1991 Ayat has been engaged in livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business with an amount of 15,000 som (KGS). The family's monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ayat's patience and persistent work, she currently has a small farm with four dairy cows. Further she has 1 hectare of irrigated land available, on which she grows clover, sweet corn and potatoes. The income made it possible for Ayat to multiply the number of livestock, and thereby increase the family's well-being. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Ayat turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of livestock. Ayat plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock. In the near future, they would like to build a dacha (second\/seasonal home)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1384309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The monthly income for the family is around 8,000 KGS.  Alina's husband helps her run the business.  Thanks to her hard work and perseverance, today Alina has one dairy cow, one calf, two horses and ten sheep.

With the goal of further developing her business, Alina has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 KGS to buy a cow.
