According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNanuli requested a loan from Credo to start-up the family business. Nanuli has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Nanuli will purchase all the needed equipment and open a wood workshop.

She opened a grocery store in 2007. The income that she earns running the store is necessary, to help her husband in making their living. Her husband works making fishing nets, which is hard work with a very low income that barely covers their needs.\r\n\r\nIman is taking her fifth loan from Kiva's partner, Al Majmoua, in order to increase her business merchandise by adding special summer beverages and ice cream.\r\n\r\nHer previous loans helped her a lot in developing her newly-established business, and she proved to be reliable in paying back her loans.

is 48 years old and lives in the Akhmeta district with his wife, son and a daughter-in-law. Rezo has requested several previous loans from local financial institutions for his family business start-up but without success. His loan requests have been rejected many times because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only income source for the family is the small amount earned by Rezo working as an artisan locally. Rezo is requesting a loan from Credo to restart his family business, which he had to stop due to financial problems. He will use his loan to purchase two pregnant pigs for starting an animal husbandry business. He will put the pigs in a shed in the yard and after several months the family will be able to sell the piglets for a good price. Rezo's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program supports the rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. Rezo's new business initiative, financed with his Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of his

Her husband is a farmer, and their combined, low income isn't enough to cover their additional, unexpected needs. That's why she applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Al Majmoua.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan in their land's restoration and in buying requested fertilizers, to help her husband in developing his farming business. This investment of the loan will help them improve the productivity of their farmland, which will positively affect their socioeconomic situation.

She is seeking 1,300,000 KHR while her member is applying for 500,000 KHR. As the leader, she will use her loan portion to buy fertilizer and plow her farmland for growing rice. She hopes that she can get a high crop yield from her farmland to have a better living condition."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1384254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and plow her farmland for growing rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Kror Kor district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-07-09T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-08T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":303.47,"local_amount":1150000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1208486.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440092679},{"amount":171.53,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":683057.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490979657}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T23:18:24Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T20:09:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shali"}},{"id":580612,"name":"Faustine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustine is a 43 year old, married man.

She has a higher education. She started a business in 2012 with 25,000 somons. She rented a storefront, opened a barber shop there, and also rents wedding dresses. Thanks to her hard work and patience, Saida was successful and began receiving a monthly profit of 14,000 somons (KGS). In addition, she grows flowers and fir trees, which she sells. In order to further grow her business, Saida has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" Microfinance Bank to request a loan in the amount of 80,000 somons (KGS) for the purchase of wedding dresses and decorations.

She lives in the small village of Chiatura District with her husband, two children and her mother-in-law, who is provided with a retirement pension. Tea requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have three milking cows, whose milk is used in dairy products. They sell the products they produce on the local markets. Besides, they have 0.5 hectare agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTea requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tea has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

She received the loan in the framework of a start-up loan program that was initiated jointly by Credo and Kiva.

She does not have any children yet and is currently living with her partner.  Quimberley makes a living selling special foods that she home delivers.  At the weekend she works with her husband.  Quimberley is enterprising, energetic and feisty.  She is always putting in the effort to earn an income to support the household.

They both live in a three-bedroom apartment in the Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon. She has faced recurring challenges in life, among which is inadequate finance to start up a business and cover her family needs. Marital problems also have been a main difficulty for her. With this loan, she plans to invest in buying vegetables of all types, such as hackberries, cabbages, and all types of green spices. Also, part of the loan will be invested in buying and selling potatoes. She believes this business will succeed, because she has been doing this for a long time, and she believes that there is high demand for foodstuffs in the region, due to increases in population, which will provide a market for the items she sells. The community will benefit from this business activity because, with the profit from this loan, she will cover her family\u2019s needs, ensure her child\u2019s education, and renovate her house. She prefers GHAPE loans because of the social talks given during GHAPE meetings and the convenient repayment schedule for the loan. Also, the members are trained in marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1384425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy and sell vegetables, potatoes and other food items.

Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe primary source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milking cow, whose milk is used in cheese products. In addition, they have a hectare of agricultural land where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the produced cheese and vegetables at local markets. It is hardly enough money for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nZaira requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Zaira has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high-risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Zaira will open a grocery shop. As the grocery shop is opened, she will be able to increase the income of her family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1384433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to open a grocery shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Keda Kokotauri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-09T14:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-08T14:20:05Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":51.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":53.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":57.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":59.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.3,"local_amount":55.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":60.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613809},{"amount":32.87,"local_amount":50.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":54.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857538},{"amount":33.72,"local_amount":51.88,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":55.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134187},{"amount":34.79,"local_amount":53.53,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":57.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107772},{"amount":35.52,"local_amount":54.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":58.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255308},{"amount":36.57,"local_amount":56.27,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":60.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019442},{"amount":37.41,"local_amount":57.54,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":61.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670559},{"amount":38.38,"local_amount":59.05,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":63.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141194},{"amount":39.44,"local_amount":60.68,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":65.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467956936}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T18:00:25Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:20:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":580713,"name":"Adja Matel's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe est compos\u00e9 de femmes tr\u00e8s d\u00e9termin\u00e9es dans leurs activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenu.

children (two sons and two daughters).  She is a nurse by profession and works at the birth and delivery center.  In search of an additonal income for her family, Jyldyzkan started to breed livestock and got involved in farming in 1999, having started this business with a sum of 15,000 som (KGS).  The family's monthly profit is 8,000 som (KGS).  Her husband is a construction worker and helps with the household business.  To-date, Jyldyzkan was able to develop her farming business and have her own farm.  Her farm contains two dairy cows, three bulls and twenty sheep, and also has 2.40 hectares of irrigated land, where she annually grows beans.  In order to further grow her farming and animal husbandry business, Jyldyzkan requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy one bull and nine sheep.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing livestock quantities on her farm and educating her

is 27 years old, married and has three children (two sons and one daughter).  She got married right after finishing school.  She has been involved in farming since 2007, having started this business with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  The family's monthly income is 8,000 som (KGS).  To-date, she was able to develop her farming business and have her own farm.  Her farm contains one dairy cow, one calf, two horses and twenty sheep.  The family is very friendly and hardworking.  They also have 1.60 hectares of irrigated land, and 2 hectares of rainfed land, where she annually grows potatoes and perennial herbs, such as clover.  In order to further grow her farming and animal husbandry business, Jazgul requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy fertilizers for potatoes and to buy one cow.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing livestock quantities on her

She says fewer goods on her table are the only challenge she faces now. She likes her business because is affordable, and she learned this way of selling from her friends. She said, \"I am proud of my business because is the only means I can help children.\" With the loan she is going to buy more milk, sugar, eggs, bread, etc. to resell. Her plan is to increase her sales even more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1384453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

La idea de comprar  los animales es para lograr los pastos que crecen de forma natural en la parte alta del volc\u00e1n en la \u00e9poca de lluvias que es un terreno que antiguamente era una finca y ahora pr\u00e1cticamente es del estado.

Pero eso ya paso comenta Wilber, le agradece  a su mama que le dio la vida y a su padre que le ense\u00f1o a trabajar. ","en":"Wilber is 21 and single.  He was born in a rural area in the foothills of the volcano.  His parents grew corn and beans and that is how he learned how to grow crops.  When he was 12, he used $11.42 of his savings to buy a calf which appeared to be on the verge of death.  It was small and skinny but he took care of it and fed it with the leftovers from crop harvests and it grew.  He sold it for $150 and used the money to buy two bigger bullocks.  Since then he has devoted himself to breeding bullocks and taming them so that they pull carts and ploughs.  After a year, he sells them (now bigger and tame enough to do heavy pulling work) for a higher price, and then buys some more and tames them, with the help of his older brother.  He obtains his agricultural supplies in the city, transporting them down the 10 kilometers from the foothills of the volcano by bus or van.  Then, if he does not have too many of them, he carries them on his back but, when he has more, he uses oxen to transport them. They cannot carry very much, but his plot of land is one kilometer away from the bus stop, at the top of a slope.  \n\nHe will use the loan he is seeking from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy two bullocks and some supplies  to sow 1.4 hectares of corn in August and 0.7 hectares of red beans in September.  He wants to buy the bullocks to graze the pasture which grows naturally in the rainy season on the upper slopes of the volcano.  This land was previously a farm and now is practically state property. The team of young bullocks feed on the natural pasture until they grow a little and then, in the summer when there is no pasture, they feed on leftovers from the corn and bean harvest and are tamed so they can pull the cart.  He wants to be able to buy the necessary supplies to grow his crops; this year they will sow a further 0.07 hectares of corn.  \n \nThe idea of working a bit more is because he wants to improve his home, which is currently made of wattle and daub with a corrugated iron roof, and one day, build it with bricks and blocks. He and his brothers share this dream because they are alone, as their mother separated from their father some years ago and then their father found a new partner.  But, as Wilber says, that is all now in the past and he thanks his mother for giving birth to him and his father for teaching him his trade.

Living conditions there are a bit difficult due to the high rate of criminal activity, few bathrooms, filthy conditions and over population, but the most interesting part is that rooms are a bit cheaper, there are options for traveling, it contains one of the biggest markets in Liberia and food costs less.    \r\n\r\nMary is a widow and has seven children who are between 30 and 18 years old. Only one of her children is currently attending school and two of them still live at home. Mary was unfortunate and could not attend school, but she is good at managing her business. For the past eight years she has been busy running her table business where she sells rice, oil, pepper, etc. With the loan proceeds she will buy more rice, oil, pepper, etc. for her business.\r\n\r\nShe said that having fewer goods is the problem she faces now. With a little money from her mother she managed to establish this business, and learned by watching other businesswomen. She said that she enjoys the flow of customers and the fast buying. Her dreams are to move from a cook shop business to a steady restaurant business and to live a better life in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1384472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is 59 years old and married with 12 children.  He is a first year farmer with myAgro, and he plants millet.  Moussa would like to take a loan for a semoir, which is a local seeding machine that has 2 boxes: one for seed and one for fertilizer.  The semoir is attached to a cow that will pull the semoir along the field, and there are diggers and a pipe behind each box that will place the correct amount of seed and fertilizer the correct distance apart. This enables farmers to plant using the micro-dosing method of planting \u2013 using a small amount of fertilizer per plant instead of the traditional method of broadcasting fertilizer.  This is less expensive since it uses less fertilizer and much better for land sustainability as well.  myAgro hopes that by providing the semoir on loan, Moussa will be able to increase the amount of land he plants using the micro-dosing method and significantly increase his farm income.  \n\nTogether with myAgro's high-quality inputs and regular trainings, he is confident that he will have a plentiful harvest.  Before Moussa planted manually, which was time-consuming and difficult to grow enough food to meet the needs of his family.  Moussa\u2019s goals are to feed his family, send his children to school, and fix his house with the extra revenue.

His business strategy is to barter with customers to get the best price. He sells the bags one at a time or in bulk, so the price differs according to how many the customer buys.\r\n<p>\r\nPatrick has received four previous loans through HOPE Congo, Kiva's partner, and has a good repayment record. He is now applying for a 2,100,000 XAF loan for his group. He will use his fourth of the loan to buy more bags to sell.\r\n<p>\r\nPatrick would like to open a big store one day.

The monthly income from the business amounts to 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Damira's hard work, today she has a good farm, containing two dairy cows, thirty sheep and four horses.  She also has 1.24 hectares of irrigated land.  The profit allowed Damira to increase livestock on her farm and, thus, improve the family welfare.  In order to further develop her business, Damira requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy livestock for fattening up and resale and also to buy mineral fertilizers for treating the land.

She holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has regular customers who buy from her both wholesale and retail. Loh Martou has a good business site and high demand in her area of residence. With this business activity, the community will benefit because food items will always be available, she will sell to them at reduced prices, and she will ensure a regular supply to her customers.\r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will cater to her family's needs and ensure her children are educated. She prefers a GHAPE loan because of low interest rates, convenient repayment schedules and also the members are trained on marketing and management skills before the loans are

Also, the high demand for pork meat in town provides her with a good market for her pigs.\r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will cater to her family's needs, ensure her child\u2019s education, and will renovate her residence.

She lives in a five-bedroom apartment in Bamenda, North West Province of Cameroon. She has faced so many challenges in life including inadequate finances to start up a business of her own and meet her family's needs, plus sickness and death of family members.\r\nWith this new loan requested, Sirri will buy piglets and feed for them and supplies for akra, a dish made of fried banana and cassava.  Sirri holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has been doing it for a long time and has regular customers who buy her akra early in the morning and the demand for pigs is high. In addition to that, the waste from pigs is used on the farm to get a high yield. With this business activity, the community will benefit from pig waste (manure) which will be used for farming, cassava from the farm as food, and her akra consumed mostly by school children. \r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will cater to her family's needs, ensure her children's education, expand her business and also save some money to undertake a bigger business investment. She prefers loans form GHAPE because of low interest rates, convenient repayment schedules and also the members are trained on marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed. Plus, the social needs of members are met at GHAPE.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1384576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

He is 44 years old and married with 6 children.  He is a 2nd year farmer with myAgro and plants maize.  Broulaye would like to take a loan for a semoir, which is a local seeding machine that has 2 boxes: one for seed and one for fertilizer.  The semoir is attached to a cow that will pull the semoir along the field, and there are diggers and a pipe behind each box that will place the correct amount of seed and fertilizer the right distance apart.  This enables farmers to plant using the micro-dosing method of planting \u2013 using a small amount of fertilizer per plant instead of the traditional method of broadcasting fertilizer.  This is less expensive since it uses less fertilizer and is much better for land sustainability as well.  myAgro hopes that by providing the semoir on loan, Broulaye will be able to increase the amount of land he plants using the micro-dosing method and significantly increase his farm income.   \n\nBroulaye would like a semoir because it would facilitate planting and make it less expensive.  Previously, Broulaye planted manually which was time-consuming and made it difficult to grow enough food to meet the needs of his family.

The semoir is attached to a cow that will pull the semoir along the field, and there are diggers and a pipe behind each box that will place the correct amount of seed and fertilizer the correct distance apart.  This enables farmers to plant using the micro-dosing method of planting \u2013 using a small amount of fertilizer per plant instead of the traditional method of broadcasting fertilizer.  This is less expensive since it uses less fertilizer and is much better for land sustainability as well.  myAgro hopes that by providing the semoir on loan, Fantoh will be able to increase the amount of land he plants using the micro-dosing method and significantly increase his farm income.  \n\nTogether with myAgro's high-quality inputs and regular trainings, Fantoh is confident that he will have a plentiful harvest.  Previously, he planted manually, which was time-consuming and made it difficult to grow enough food to meet the needs of his family.  Fantoh\u2019s goals are to earn additional income, save a little bit, feed his family, send his children to school, and provide healthcare for them.  Fantoh says myAgro helps him reach his goals by providing good quality seeds and fertilizer and informative trainings on a regular basis.  Fantoh will also be able to rent his semoir to others to earn extra income.  All semoirs are covered by a 2-year guarantee that covers most repairs within a 1-week time period. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1383182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy farming equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fani Kondialan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2013-07-09T21:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-08T21:10:14Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fantoh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-31T09:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":75858.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":441417859}],"funded_date":"2013-07-11T01:39:45Z","paid_date":"2014-01-31T09:39:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":581436,"name":"Julio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio tiene 46 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado y vive en su casa propia junto su esposa y sus 3 hijos.

He is 58 years old, married and has 12 children.  He is a 1st year farmer with myAgro and plants maize, millet and sorghum.  Bocar would like to take a loan for a semoir, which is a local seeding machine that has 2 boxes: one for seed and one for fertilizer.  The semoir is attached to a cow that will pull the semoir along the field, and there are diggers and a pipe behind each box that will place the correct amount of seed and fertilizer the right distance apart.  This enables farmers to plant using the micro-dosing method of planting \u2013 using a small amount of fertilizer per plant instead of the traditional method of broadcasting fertilizer.  This is less expensive since it uses less fertilizer and is much better for land sustainability as well.  myAgro hopes that by providing the semoir on loan, Bocar will be able to increase the amount of land he plants using the micro-dosing method and significantly increase his farm income.  \n\nBocar would like a semoir because it will help him plant a larger field of maize and follow better planting methods.

(NORIA), an association of organic rice farmers located on the island of Negros, Philippines. It is an SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) registered association with over 300 organic rice farmers from various parts of the island on its membership roster.\n\nThe majority of members have small landholdings \u2013 all below 4 hectares in size. Many have about a hectare, which they acquired from the government as Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries. \n\nWith no economies of scale, it would have been practical for them to follow conventional methods using chemical fertilizers paired with a good dose of pesticides to boost their production. But in spite of the obvious hurdles organic farming entails, these small farmers made a conscious choice to convert their land into organic rice farms because they believe that going back to nature will ensure a healthier lifestyle for themselves, their families and communities.\n\nMany of these organic practitioners also believe that this is the way to ensure food security of the island. They also believe that moving away from chemical fertilizers and pesticides protects the environment and encourages the biodiversity of the island. \n\nTo ensure that the members benefit from the premium going organic provides, NORIA, led by its President, Ahmon, and Leo, head of the association\u2019s Business Management Committee, is borrowing PHP 1,000,000.00 from NWTF. The group intends to use the money as a revolving credit line to purchase the organic rice harvest of its members. This ensures a fair price at the farm gate. \n\nBy consolidating the harvest and milling the rice themselves, NORIA is protecting the integrity and provenance of the organic rice, and this will enable it to market the certified organic rice at a premium. At the moment this certified organic rice is sold at the Negros Occidental Organic Market, but will soon be available in supermarkets in Negros and the neighboring islands.\n\nAt present, the association has about 300 hectares of certified organic rice farms, but with the boost in their buying capacity, they are hoping to be able to encourage more farmers to go organic and increase their land area up to 1,000 hectares by the end of the year. \n\nNORIA has 3 main objectives: first, to strengthen the organic rice farming industry in Negros by providing training in the best organic farming practices, second \u2013 to strengthen economic development and sustainability of organic rice farmers through private-public partnerships; and third, to ensure that the price of organic rice is stable and fair at the farm gate.\n\nNORIA is working hard to achieve Negros Island's vision of becoming the Organic Food Bowl of the Philippines.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":23100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":23100,"image":{"id":1382158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Job Creation"],"use":"to purchase the organic rice harvest of the association's members at a fair price ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2013-07-10T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-09T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":23100,"lender_count":409,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#PowerfulStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Negros Organic Rice Industry Association, Inc.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":23100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23100,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1000912.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504313487}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T19:36:39Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:59:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Nethery","image":268367}},{"id":576788,"name":"Yong's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yong is 51 years old and lives with his wife and two daughters in a rural village of the Sa Ang district.

polygamous families in Samba, one of the villages in Kebila (Kolondieba prefecture, 3rd administrative region of Mali). They are working with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to carry out their farming activities during the rainy season. This is their 2nd loan from the institution. The previous loan has been correctly repaid.\r\n\r\nRamatou B, standing second from the right in the picture, grows groundnuts.

She is already known and has loyal customers from whom she gets stable profits. \r\n\r\nAlso, in the afternoons she has begun to sell food to four people who pay for the meals.  She makes good profits since she uses the meat from her own animals.  This is her sixth Kiva loan and she is grateful for the financial support that she receives to get ahead in life.  Additionally, she promises to make her payments in a timely manner.

She lives with her husband, Juan, and their four children, only two of whom live with them in their rented house.  \r\n\r\nFor the past six years Mar\u00eda has dedicated her time and effort to improving her economic situation.  She and her husband earn their living farming and raising livestock.  On their own land they grow potatoes, corn, and beans, which they painstakingly fertilize, look after, and harvest because they know they'll be rewarded when they sell their products at the city market.  Mar\u00eda says that she herself transports the produce to be sold. \"I have to make the most of the sale and fetch the best price,\" she says.  She also raises animals including pigs and sheep, which she fattens up so she can sell the meat later on.  Thanks to her business, Mar\u00eda brings in a steady income to keep up with household expenses.  Now she wants to increase her working capital so she can have higher profits.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third Kiva loan, and during all this time she has managed to advance herself in her business and bring in money for her children's futures, so she promises to be punctual with her payments.  Mar\u00eda will invest the 4000 soles in organic fertilizer for the next harvest.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1385568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-07-10T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-09T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":283.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":279.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":290.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":304.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":308.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":329.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":334.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":347.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":365.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":373.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":387.77},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":396.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.43},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.87,"local_amount":283.79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":287.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997423},{"amount":101.44,"local_amount":279.82,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":283.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864894},{"amount":105.13,"local_amount":290.03,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":293.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353260},{"amount":110.34,"local_amount":304.38,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":307.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905027},{"amount":111.77,"local_amount":308.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-26T09:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":311.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091027},{"amount":119.27,"local_amount":329.03,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-28T09:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":332.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777639},{"amount":799.18,"local_amount":2204.63,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2230.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598065}],"funded_date":"2013-07-14T06:04:55Z","paid_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":580963,"name":"Jonave","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of two children, Jonave works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a general store business in the Philippines and also earns additional income from selling fish. \r\n\r\nJonave is borrowing PHP 25,000 through NWTF to purchase more grocery items like canned goods, milk, soap, eggs, etc., for her general store business.\r\n\r\nShe successfully paid back her previous loan and now she requested a new loan to further build her general store and fish vending business.\r\n\r\nJonave has been sustaining her business activities through her past six loans from NWTF.

She has worked with cattle since 1999, having started her business with 4,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work and endurance, today she has a monthly profit of 6,000 KGS.  Among her animals, she has two dairy cows, one horse and five sheep.  With the goal of expand her herd, Sveta has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy cows to breed.  She wants to use the income from the loan to make repairs to her home.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union she lost her job and to find a steady income to support her family she began farming and raising animials. She began her business with 10,000 somoni. Thankfully through her back-breaking labor and tireless work Kalbubu achieved a little progress and began to make a profit of 10,000 somoni a month. Nowadays on the farm Kalbubu has two cows and twenty sheep. She also had allotted land for planting and processing beans. In order to further develop her business, Kalbubu is appealing to \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan of 40,000 somoni to buy fertilizer and fuel. Income from the loan Kalbubu plans to invest in the development of their small

The group is working with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to better carry out their farming during the rainy season. They are on their fourth loan with the institution, and their previous loans have been repaid correctly.\r\n\r\nMatou, the first woman seated on the left in the photo, grows groundnuts. With her loan, she plans on buying farm inputs and seeds and paying the cost of labor to cultivate two hectares of land. After the harvest, the crop is sold in the village and in Fakola to men and women customers. \r\n\r\nMatou hopes to earn 145,000 francs CFA per season. These earnings will allow her to pay back her loan and to also help her husband with the everyday expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1385270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy farm inputs and seeds and to pay the cost of labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Togodaba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-07-10T16:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-09T16:20:01Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minatadjan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata Kassoum ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia Diakaridia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1475,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":754404.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220035}],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T15:24:08Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:37:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lindsay","image":839627}},{"id":580980,"name":"Al-Fateh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Al-Fateh Group consists of four women who live in Hodeida, Yemen.
