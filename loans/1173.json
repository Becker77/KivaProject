All of them are neighbors from the same community. It is a very beautiful community characterized by its enormous lake. The group members say that they can take advantage of the lake to fish for free. The community is also distinguished by its giant trees. The town's biggest holiday is celebrated on August 2, the day of Our Lady of the Angels. \n\nDo\u00f1a Yola, as she is affectionately known, is 38, and has been married to Raul for 20 years. He works as a construction worker. Together, they have made a family with five children. Yola is asking for the loan to buy notions like marbles, clothespins, ribbons, brooches, hairpins, nail clippers, files, and hooks, etc. This is her first time doing this activity. She has never had a business like this one. Previously she worked raising, fattening, and selling chicken, but she doesn't want to stay in this line of work because coyotes eat the chickens. Yola is planning on selling her goods by the door of the church. On Sundays, her daughters will attend to her business while she works as a domestic employee. \n\nShe is very glad she will start her business. She didn't have money to purchase her products, but thanks to the loan, she will have her new business. Thanks to this, she will be able to earn more income for her family. Yola wants to have her own, larger business in her home, with the ultimate goal of being able to help out with household expenses and the education that her children want. \"Two of my children did not want to continue studying, but I want the other three children, who are still studying, to study a professional degree.\"\n\nJust as Yola wants to better herself, the other group members are asking for a loan to invest in their economic activites: Marybel sells aprons and flowers, Trinidad has a beauty salon, Elena sells aprons, and Maria and Rosa Maria raise yearling sheep. Aurea and Filiberto will invest in their bull calves  and feed and Teresa will invess in her sweet sales.

She has requested this loan from VisionFund in order to invest in purchasing a variety of cosmetics (eye shadows, lipsticks, foundation, perfume, eyeliners, and nail polish).\r\n\r\nGeorgina is grateful for the support this loan will give her and her group.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nTeresa \u2013 cosmetics sales\r\nAlvaro \u2013 taxi services\r\nRosalia \u2013 linen and bedspread sales\r\nEsmirna \u2013 linen, shoes, and clothing sales"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1381769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase nail polish, eyeliners, perfume, eye shadows, and foundation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca, Ver","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-07-10T20:31:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-09T20:31:05Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Georgina Yara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alvaro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esmirna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":466.67,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6011.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698690},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3005.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698691},{"amount":466.67,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6011.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944853},{"amount":466.66,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6011.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227927},{"amount":466.67,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:45:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6011.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991770},{"amount":700,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9017.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644429}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T12:25:39Z","paid_date":"2013-12-18T00:13:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Minogue","image":null}},{"id":581033,"name":"Leonila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonila is 51 years old, widowed, and has five children, one of whom attends school.

He belongs to a group of people who take out loans to improve their businesses to be able to give their families a better quality of life. His group is called Aves de Para\u00edso and he says that the other members of the group told him they gave it that name because where they used to meet there were some very pretty flowers with that name. He is married and has 5 children, 3 of whom are in school, since the oldest didn't want to go to school anymore and decided to start working. In the morning, Florencio sells popsicles and ice cream in the streets of his community. He says that he doesn't make them, he just buys them and sells them, mainly outside of schools, since most of his customers are children. In the afternoon, he fixes televisions in his home, since he doesn't have a locale. Sometimes people go to his house wanting him to fix an appliance. He says that he learned to fix appliances because a friend invited him to work and learn how to fix appliances and over time Florencio decided to start his own business. Now he is asking VisionFund for help so that he can get a loan to improve his businesses. He wants to stock up on ice cream and popsicles and also buy barquillos and plastic cups to sell the ice cream in. He also wants to buy different replacement parts and materials that he uses to give better service. Florencio's goal is to keep selling his ice cream and popsicles and also set up a workshop in his house to fix the appliances. The other members of the group are named Isela, Mar\u00eda Remedios, Cirenia, Socorro, Yaquelin, Marcela, Sandra, Maribel and Antol\u00edn. They will invest their loans in buying corn to make handmade tortillas, firewood, a comal, in buying materials such wood and nails to make wooden crates for fruit, in buying store merchandise such as groceries, in buying candies as merchandise, in buying construction materials to sell such as bricks, sand, cement, etc., in buying chickens to raise and sell, as well as their feed. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6600,"image":{"id":1381886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy replacement parts and materials to repair appliances and to buy ice cream and popsicles.

Saltanat's spouse is a shepherd, herding the animals belonging to the people in their village.  Thanks to Saltanat's hard work, today she has many animals: two dairy cows, two calves, and ten sheep.  She also has .43 hectares of irrigated land, and an additional allotment of .22 hectares.  The profits from her efforts allow Saltanat to breed her animals and improve her family's circumstances.  With the goal of further business growth, she has turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy dairy cows.

His family's income is composed of his retirement pension and his wife\u2019s and son's salaries. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, they moved to their current apartment, and since then they haven't made any repairs or added insulation to their home. So, he is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase vacuum-insulated windows, hardwood floors and fiberglass. He will replace the old windows and floors with more durable and quality ones. As a result, during wintertime, the frosts and storms won't chill down the family to its core. This way it will spare more energy and contribute to the environmental cause. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3251.8,"image":{"id":1385051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

The customers rent the washing machines from Jairo by the hour. They call him by telephone asking for the service. He takes the washing machines to their houses, and after the agreed-upon rental time has passed, he goes to pick them up. The payment for these services is in cash. He offers this service to his customers every day, from 7 in the morning to 7 at night. The expenses of the business are only for maintenance and buying parts. His business was born a year ago due to the need to generate income because of the death of his grandmother, who was the one who contributed mostly to the family expenses. This is his first Kiva loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and he will use it to buy more washing machines, to offer better service with regard to the time for repairs and to new customers who request the service.

She previously accessed a 15,000 PHP loan that she used to buy spare parts, accessories and for the maintenance of their jeepney unit. Her earnings were a big help for her children's education, and in their personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 20,000 PHP loan for her to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of their jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs and her children's education. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAna hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a better life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and it is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, which is open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1208786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

14. She has vocational secondary education, and is an accountant by profession. Currently she works as a librarian at the local school. In 1998 she decided to work with livestock breeding. Thanks to her decisive character and persistence, she developed her farm and currently it has two cows, two steers and four sheep. She started this business with 3,000 som (KGS) and has increased monthly the income to 17,000 som (KGS). Her husband helps her with the business. Her son goes to school. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her small business, Ainakan turned to us in the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS), for increasing the number of livestock. Ainakan plans to invest the income from the loan in developing the business. In the future she plans to provide her son with higher

She is married and lives with her husband and three children in the J.Rumy region. \r\n\r\nIn the latest years Mavludakhon has worked as a cook at a cafe. Currently she would like to open her own family business. She is interested in sheep breeding. In her own words, sheep are unpretentious and breeding them is not laborious. And because sheep are grazing animals she won't have any problems with fodder. Besides, this wonderful animal gives more types of products than other types of livestock. In particular: Meat, fat, milk, wool, fur products, astrakhan fur and leather. Therefore sheep are always in demand, in order to support a stable income. \r\n\r\nAll members of Mavludakhon's family will help her with managing the new business. Mavludakhon requests a loan for the purchase of four sheep. With the income she would like to realize her dream - to marry away her eldest son. Mavludakhon trusts in and hopes for your

Now he and his sons are farmers. Before, in Soviet times, he worked on a farm, so he has lots of experience in this field. In addition to working with livestock, Karshiboy has a plot of land where he grows onions, carrots, and tomatoes. His wife and daughter help him. While Karshiboy and his sons are busy farming his wife and daughter look after the cattle; they milk the cows and produce dairy products from the milk such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and butter. Karshiboy is very busy in the summer and therefore goes to the market early in the morning to deliver the harvest of vegetables and trade with wholesale merchants. At this time Karshiboy wants to grow his herd and for this purpose he applied to Arvand. He is very glad and thankful for the loan that will let him grow his herd."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1383817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle.

He has to take a lot of time to complete his work. He wants to purchase an embroidery machine; however, due to lack of finances he finds it difficult. \r\n\r\nShafqat has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, with the goal of improving her husband's business. He will use the loan amount to purchase an embroidery machine to work more efficiently and professionally. With the profits expected from this loan, he intends to expand his business so that he can eventually construct a small house for his family.

His loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, he has a plot of agricultural land where peach trees are grown. Arsena looks after the trees and does all the agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. The harvested peaches are sold at local markets at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family as the income is only seasonally. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nArsena requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Arsena has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Arsena will purchase minibus. After the minibus is purchased he will begin trade with fruits and vegetables. He plans to purchase fruits and vegetables from the wholesalers and then resell at higher price. This will increase the income of his family. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will give him a chance to have regular income and thus will significantly improve

Nika and his brothers do all the agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. As well as these activities, Nika works as an artisan and repairs damaged cars and motorbikes. He is a very hardworking young man and does his best to increase the income of his family. Nika requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Nika has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Nika will purchase piglets. After purchasing the piglets he will be able to start an animal husbandry business. As the piglets grow, he will sell some of them at a higher price. Other pigs will be used to start a new generation and expand the business for the future.

Kobuleti district. The source of income for the family is a small-scale agricultural business. In particular, Ruslan and his father cultivate a plot of land where citrus, nuts, and maize are grown. They sell the harvested products at the local open market. \r\n \r\nSeveral times, Ruslan has requested a loan from local financial institutions, but his loan requests were always rejected because of low income and lack of experience in the new business. His current loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. \r\n\r\nRuslan owns a car and plans to serve the locals as a taxi driver, but he will charge higher prices for his service because the benzene price is high. Not many citizens can afford to use the taxi service at a higher price. Because of the above mentioned problem, Ruslan has decided to change his taxi's fuel system from benzene to gas, which is cheaper than benzene, and will reduce the cost of transportation by 40 to 45 percent.

After the death of her husband, the family provider, Nurjamal became involved in farming and animal husbandry in search of a source of income for the family.  She started the business with 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her strenuous and capacious work, Nurjamal achieved small successes in developing the business and started to earn a monthly profit in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS).  Today, her business contains 2 dairy cows, 22 sheep, 8 goats and 1 horse.  She also has a land plot of 4.20 hectares, where she plants beans.  Her two sons help with the business.  The oldest son is working in Russia.  He helps financially by sending his salary to the family in Kyrgyzstan every month.  In order to further develop her business, Nurjamal requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy mineral fertilizers and fuel for treating the land.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further developing her small business and also plans to build a new house in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1385125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy mineral fertilizers and fuel for treating the land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Aral village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurjamal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:51:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5121.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426931},{"amount":106.45,"local_amount":5069.21,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552979},{"amount":412.06,"local_amount":19930.79,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":20415.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.49,"payment_id":459019435},{"amount":210,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053202},{"amount":105,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5121.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749365},{"amount":105,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5121.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178085}],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T19:01:51Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":581197,"name":"Parveen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parveen is the wife of a hard working electrician.

Solomon\u2019s daughter is a student. The family managed to save enough money to purchase a car. As their existing income isn\u2019t enough for the family and their living conditions are poor, Solomon decided to serve the locals as a taxi driver with his own car but he needs money to pay the tax for it. His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program aims to provide business start-up and restart-up loans with more favorable conditions to rural poor people. They do not have access to standard credit, being regarded as 'high-risk borrowers' because of their low income. After the tax is paid, Solomon will start his business and the income of the family will increase.

Since 1988, she has been engaged in sewing the national quilts of Kyrgyzstan and also sews the dowry ordered by girls of marriageable age.  The business is very good, but most importantly, Toktokan loves her work and it brings in a monthly income of 20,000 KGS.  Despite the loss of business caused by riots in 2010, Toktokan was able to survive and further develop her business.  With the goal of further growth, Toktokan turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 KGS to buy a new, innovated sewing machine.  She wants to use the income from the loan to make home repairs.

Taslim has to cover the expenditures but he has limited money, since his salary as a teacher is insufficient.

He lives with his wife and 14-year-old son, who goes to the local school.  Zurab requested a loan from the local financial institutions several times, for a family business start-up, without success.  His loan request was always rejected because of the family\u2019s low income and poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe only source of income is from agricultural activities.  In particular, he has a plot of agricultural land, where maize and strawberries are grown.  Zurab looks after and does all the agricultural work to ensure a good harvest.  The harvested products are sold at local markets at a good price.  It is hardly enough to feed the family, as the income is only seasonal.  According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nZurab requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business.  Zurab has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people.  These individuals do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u2018high risk borrowers\u2019 because of their low income.  With the received credit Zurab will purchase a minibus.  After the minibus is purchased he will begin trading with fruits and vegetables.  He plans to purchase fruits and vegetables from the wholesalers and then resell them at a higher price.  This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed by the loan, will give him a chance to have a regular income, thus significantly improving the living conditions of the family.

She is a widow and lives in the village of Dighomi with her daughter. She has requested loans from local financial institutions several times without success in order to restart up her clothing trading business, which closed because of financial problems. Her loan requests were rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is Nestan\u2019s small monthly salary. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit with soft conditions to the country's rural poor. They do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

Zakaria has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Zakaria will purchase a tractor. After the tractor is purchased, he will go to the forest and transport lumber for selling. This will increase the income of their family.

All the family members get monthly salaries. \r\n\r\nSeveral times, Tea has requested loans from local financial institutions in order to start up her clothing trading business, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected because of lack of experience in the business, which is usually demanded by local financial institutions. \r\n\r\nHer loan request has now been approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit, with soft conditions to country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high-risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tea plans to purchase clothing from wholesalers in Turkey and then sell these items from her house. After investing the funds in her business, Tea hopes to generate additional revenue and invest the profits to further develop her business. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva

He lives with his brother Aleksandre, who is 45 years old. Because he is an invalid, Aleksandre is provided with a monthly pension from government institutions. \r\nNaskida applied for loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were always rejected, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nNaskida is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has a vineyard and sells the harvested grapes at local markets. Besides that, he has a plot of agricultural land where tomatoes are grown. Naskida also works as a laborer and helps his fellow villagers by doing agricultural work for fees. He is a very hardworking man and does his best to increase his family\u2019s income, but his income is hardly enough to provide food for the family. \r\nAccording to Credo\u2019s evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Naskida requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Naskida has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the credit Naskida will buy calves. As calves are purchased, he will raise them and produce dairy products in the future. This will be an additional source of income for them to buy all the medicine for his brother. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1385365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase calves to be used to produce dairy products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gurjaani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T20:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T20:40:08Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naskida","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":483.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":400.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255321},{"amount":483.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":800.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019455}],"funded_date":"2013-07-15T01:59:47Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":581332,"name":"Riadh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riadh is a 27-year-old, married man who has three children and lives in Taiz, Yemen.

","en":"Tochy is a very kind and open-hearted woman. She is 54 years old, married, and has two sons. Tochy grew up in a poor family in a rural area and got married not far from where she grew up. Her husband Bakhron did not learn a trade or profession and performs unskilled labor. He works on constuction sites and earns a small amount of money. Her adult sons work in Russia because they could not find permanent jobs in Tajikistan. Tochy has raised cattle for over 35 years. She has extensive experience breeding cattle and runs her own business. She sells cattle at the local market and has repeat customers. Tochy began building a new house because the one they live in now is small. She wants her second son to get married, but he and his wife would have nowhere to live. Her sons sent her all of the money they had saved up over the past year, but it wasn't enough to build the house. This is why she has asked for a loan of 4000 somoni to purchase construction materials such as cement, wood, and so forth to build the new house. She awaits your kindness and hopes for your charity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1385189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy building materials for building a new house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tochy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":9.7,"local_amount":45.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550377},{"amount":840.3,"local_amount":3954.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4006.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228160}],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T19:50:31Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T10:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":581333,"name":"Valens","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valens is 31 years old.

She is married and lives with her husband, two children (13 and 14 years old) and her mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Her children go to a local school. Maia applied for loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were always rejected, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agriculture. In particular, they have a milking cow, whose milk is used to make cheese products. Maia produces cheese every day and sells it at local markets at a good price. The income is hardly enough for food for the family. \r\nAccording to Credo\u2019s evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Maia applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Maia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the credit, Maia will begin trading in clothing and bed-linens. She plans to go to Turkey and buy clothing and bed-linens from wholesalers and then to resell them at higher prices among her villagers. This will give her a chance to increase her family's income. The new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the family\u2019s living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1385371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to begin trading in clothing and bed-linens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Bijnisi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T20:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T20:50:17Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":95.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":99.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.43},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":104.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":108.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":110.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":113.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.44,"local_amount":82.3,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":85.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857551},{"amount":573.56,"local_amount":917.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":949.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134200}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T20:23:38Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:16:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":581325,"name":"Agness","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agness is single and has three children, all of whom attend school and are under her care.

","en":"Jamshed is a conscientious and hardworking person.  He is a poor person and this is why he lives with his family in an old house that is not suited for living.  He lives in a rural area and wants to repair his house and create better living conditions for the winter because the winter weather is very cold, and his district is expected to have limitations on electricity.  He has a decent and happy family.  Jamshed has two children.  His wife is a very kind and pure woman.  Jamshed has been involved in animal husbandry for over 15 years because the climate and conditions in his place of residence are quite good for animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops.  Jamshed's wife helps him with running the business.  Jamshed and his family have been planning to repair their house, but do not have money.  This plan became a big dream for his family, and the reality of this dream is such that Jamshed is requesting a loan in the amount of 3000 somoni to purchase construction materials, such as cement, wood, etc., to repair his house.  He awaits your kindness and hopes for your

She is married to Efren, a driver, and is a mother to her children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnna owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one jeepney unit (14-16 person capacity), which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney. \r\n\r\nAnna dreams to continuously expand her business and hopes to give her children a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1387476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T21:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T21:50:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3475.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534905},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2896.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784298},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.37,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2317.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771285}],"funded_date":"2013-07-11T22:23:32Z","paid_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":581900,"name":"Madres Unidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria de 46 a\u00f1os es integrante del grupo \u201cMadres Unidas\u201d conformada por 08 personas din\u00e1micas que luchan cada d\u00eda por  salir adelante.

She lives in the Pursat province. For the past 22 years Sokheng has struggled to feed her family by farming rice and raising pigs while her husband is a vet in their local area.

In the yard of her home, she grows corn, the leaves from which she feeds to her animals.  Her mother and father-in-law help her run the business.  She is taking out a loan to buy cows and calves.  Thanks to this loan, Munira will be able to increase the number of animals she sells which will increase her quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1383218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

This group of hard working and dedicated teachers have come to Kiva field partner, Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT) to apply for a loan of SLL 8,800,000.00 for the entire group. With the help of the staff loan products specifically designed to meet the needs of low paid staff, these teachers will be able to buy goods or invest in projects that, left alone with their salaries, they would not be able to buy or invest in. But with this loan, they are being empowered and at the end of each month, they can easily repay the loan. It is their school's bursar who is directly responsible for doing the deductions and making the repayments on their behalf.\r\n\r\nThe featured leader of this group is Ruth. Ruth is a native of Gorama, she is 36. Ruth is married to a contractor. For 12 years now, Ruth has been a professional teacher. She has requested this loan in order to pay school fees for her children.

She has a market table where she has been selling milk, candle, toothpaste, battery etc for the past four years. She works at her business nine hours a day. She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is she wants to change the waiter-market business to palm oil and dry meat business. She did not go to school. She has four children between one and ten. Only three are at home and in school. With the proceeds from the loan, she wants to change her business by buying palm oil and dry meat to resell. She describes herself as a hard-working woman. She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house. She is proud of her business because she gets money every day for her expenses. She wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\n\nSiah and her fiance stay together. She did not go to school. She has three children between 8 and 1 years old. Two of her children are in school and they all live at home. For the past four years, she has been selling rubber dishes (bowls, cups, spoons, plates, etc.) in the local market in order to help her children. She started this business by selling for her mother, and she learned this business from her. She likes her business because of the ways people respond to it. She is requesting a loan to purchase more rubber dishes for her business in hopes of having more money to sustain her

This will enable her to maximize the income she earns since her customers will be buying cosmetics from her shop.\n\nCatherine learned of Milango through her friends at a time she really needed to finance her business. She received a previous loan with Milango that she repaid without problems. Catherine is now requesting a new loan to buy shelves, braids and weaves for her salon.

Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n\r\nBetty is married with seven children between one and 16 years old, only five of whom are in school and live at home. She did not go to school, but she is good at managing her business. For the past three years, she has been selling slippers in the local market. She started this business with a little amount from her mother and she learned this business from her. She likes how people respond to her business, and mostly she enjoys the interaction with her customers. She spends eight hours with her business, six day a week.  She is requesting a loan to purchase more slippers for her business. She hopes to get more money and build a house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1380451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is married and has three children, between 25 and 16 years old.  Only two are currently attending school, and they all live at home.  Finna did go to school, but engages in business to help herself.  She describes herself as a hard-working woman.\n\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County. It is located by the sea.  It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating 'fufu,' a dish made from a cassava-based dough that is typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city speak Bassa, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\n \nFinna has a table business, where she has sold pepper, oil, bitter-ball, okra and other food ingredients, for the past three years. She started her business with money she got from her husband.  She works at her business from 8:00AM to 4:00PM each day.  Her greatest challenge in business is low income. She intends to use the loan to buy more pepper, oil, bitter-ball, okra and other food ingredients to resell at her table.  She likes her business, because it helps her to support her home.  \n\nFinna hopes one day to own a house. She wants to thank the Kiva lenders, in advance, for their help.
