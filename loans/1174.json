Her husband works as driver, and they have four children between 14 and 4. Their children are currently attending school and live at home. \n\nEvelyn was not fortunate enough to attend school, but she is busy running her table business where she sells slippers, body cream, and clothes in the market of New Kru Town. With a little money from her mother, she managed to established this business five years ago, and she learned it by watching other businesswomen.

She says the main challenges faced are competition and high import duty when bringing in a lot of stuff. Ntombezinhle has requested a loan of $500 to buy shoes,balnkets and clothes for resale. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will enable her to have more income to buy food and pay fees for her child, as well as pay rentals for her business premises.

This is the first loan she\u2019s taking out with her friends and companions who form this group with the same goal: personal and family improvement.\r\n\r\nEulalia is 46-years-old, married and has conceived five children who are 28, 27, 21, 20 and 17 years of age.  Her oldest son is married and lives independently, her second and fourth attend university, her third works and the last one attends secondary school in the city.  Her husband works in his carpentry shop.\r\n\r\nEulalia\u2019s a merchant.  She sells all types of clothes and a great variety of cosmetics, an activity she\u2019s been carrying out for 20 years.  She has a shop of her own downtown and works Monday to Saturday with no fixed schedule.  She will use the money to buy clothes and cosmetics for her customers.  Her goal is to enlarge her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1386353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T23:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T23:50:07Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace Valeria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthya Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ligia Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geovanna Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3273.95,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":272.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":818.75,"local_amount":818.49,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":818.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815793},{"amount":545.84,"local_amount":545.66,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":545.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410966004},{"amount":818.75,"local_amount":818.49,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":818.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857740},{"amount":545.84,"local_amount":545.66,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:58:54Z","rounded_local_amount":545.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506117},{"amount":545.82,"local_amount":545.65,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":545.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439729906}],"funded_date":"2013-08-09T00:19:19Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:09:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":581912,"name":"Jardin De Rosas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Angelina esta casada, tienen 32 a\u00f1os de edad, no tuvo la oportunidad de estudiar, tiene 5 hijos y 2 de ellos estan estudiando, se dedica a la crianza de de ganado porcino, inici\u00f3 este negocio con unas gallinas luego decidio criar cerdos, hasta la fecha lleva 5 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nOrganiza un grupo para poder solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 pra la compra de cerditos para criarlos y luego venderlos, desea en el futuro tener una granja con cerdos y pollos.

Tsitsino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is actively involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have a pig, 2 milking cows and 2 calves. Tsitsino produces dairy products for selling. Her son has rented a bus and works on the bus line. Their income is hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTsitsino has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tsitsino has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Tsitsino will purchase a bus. After the bus is purchased, her son will not have to rent a bus and will be able to generate more income.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Upon her arrival, she obtained her teaching certification here in San Diego, in order to begin teaching in her new hometown.  A year after getting settled in San Diego, Emilie and Gil welcomed their son Mateo (pictured center), another driving force in their desire to create this home-based school!\n\nEmilie learned of the Montessori method while teaching in France and Canada. Her younger sister also attended a Montessori school, and she was impressed with its impact. \u201cI watched my sister blossom and witnessed such growth and independence in her,\u201d she shared. Emilie and Gil were initially motivated by a desire to provide a learning environment for their son. \u201cWe really believe in a peaceful environment where children can learn life skills and grow up to be independent and productive,\u201d said Emilie. The idea to set up a French Montessori school made sense to Emilie and Gil, seeing as Emilie is fluent in French and English and that it will be the first French Montessori School in San Diego. \n\n\u201cShe says she wants a big family,\u201d Gil shared with a smile. Emilie is on track to have just that, as when the school opens in September, Emilie will have six students between the ages of two and four in her home. The plan is to hire a teaching assistant next year and have as many as 12 students in her program.\n\nA loan of $7,000 helps Emilie to purchase Montessori materials for her school and upgrade her home

Ahora vive con sus hijos en La Concordia un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas que anteriormente pertenec\u00eda a la Provincia de Esmeraldas. Es considerado un cant\u00f3n muy fuerte en la agroindustria y exportaci\u00f3n de varios productos como palma africana, macadamia y palmito por lo cual un aproximado de m\u00e1s de 300 millones de d\u00f3lares se mueven solo en este cant\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n el turismo es una fuente de econom\u00eda, pues hay lugares que son visitados y los habitantes del pueblo aprovechan este movimiento para comercializar todo tipo de productos con negocios establecidos en cada rinc\u00f3n como restaurantes, tiendas, farmacias, almacenes de ropa, tours, etc.\nGabriela aprendi\u00f3 desde muy joven las labores del campo y se especializ\u00f3 en los cultivos de maracuy\u00e1 y cacao, dos frutos que tienen alta demanda en la zona y son cultivados en muchos terrenos, pues el clima del lugar se presta para esta producci\u00f3n. Es por esto que desde hace 2 a\u00f1os Gabriela dedica al menos 6 horas cada d\u00eda en la producci\u00f3n de cacao y maracuy\u00e1 que posteriormente vende en el mercado de la zona o bajo pedidos de varios clientes. En medio de varias actividades complejas, Gabriela ha ganado mucha experiencia y necesita incrementar su producci\u00f3n, pues mientras sus hijos crecen ella debe incurrir en gastos mayores. \nCon el objetivo de aumentar cultivos y mejorar la calidad de los ya existentes, Gabriela solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en semillas y abono con lo cual aumentar\u00e1 la producci\u00f3n y por ende sus ganancias ser\u00e1n mayores, de esta forma podr\u00e1 ofrecer a sus hijos un mejor estilo de vida y adem\u00e1s podr\u00e1 brindarles la educaci\u00f3n que ella no pudo terminar y as\u00ed hacer realidad su sue\u00f1o de un d\u00eda poder  verlos obteniendo su t\u00edtulo profesional. \nEn anteriores ocasiones, Gabriela no hab\u00eda podido acceder a los cr\u00e9ditos de instituciones financieras, sin embargo gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y su producto Kiva ha podido contar con el apoyo que ella tanto esperaba y por el cual agradece de antemano a aquellas personas que en varias partes del mundo se unen a sus sue\u00f1os para hacerlos realidad.","en":"Gabriela is 29 years old.  She is the mother of two children who are six and two whom she hopes to see grow up with the best health, education, and stability.  They are why she applies herself every day in spite of the barriers that many people put in front of her because of her lack of education, as she dropped out of secondary school and started working.  She currently lives with her children in La Concordia, a canton of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas that used to be part of the Esmeraldas Province.  It is known as a canton that is very big on agro-industry and the exportation of various produce, such as African oil palms, macadamias, and fan palms, which is why over 300 million dollars move through this canton alone.  Tourism is also a source of income, as there are areas that attract visitors and the locals take advantage of this to sell all kinds of products with businesses on every corner, such as restaurants, stores, pharmacies, clothing outlets, tours, etc.  \r\n\r\nGabriela learned to work in the fields as a very young girl and she specialized in passion fruit and cacao, two fruits that are in high demand in the area and which are grown on a lot of land, as the area's climate lends itself to these crops.  That is why for two years now Gabriela has spent at least six hours a day on her cacao and passion fruit crops, which she then sells at the local market or to customers who place orders.  Gabriela has gained a lot of experience through all of her complex activities and she needs to increase her yield, as her expenses will grow with her children.    \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her crops and improve the quality of the ones she has, Gabriela is asking for a loan to invest in seed and fertilizer with which to increase her harvest, which will in turn increase her profits.  This will allow her to offer her children a better way of life and the education that she was not able to finish.  This will make her dream of one day seeing them receive professional degrees come true.   \r\n\r\nPreviously, Gabriela did not have access to loans from financial institutions, but thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva she has been able to count on the support that she hoped for so dearly.  She would like to give thanks in advance to the people in different parts of the world who take up the cause of her dreams to make them a reality."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1387056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

small son.  She loves them very much and they are the main motivation in her life.  Maria is a very kind, hard-working, enthusiastic person who makes every effort, together with her husband, to provide for the family.  Unfortunately, because of a lack of economic resources and due to the need to work, Maria was unable to get a nursing degree as she would have liked.  In her free time she enjoys watching television and sometimes makes delicious pork cracklings to share with the family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with much hard work and dedication, Maria works as a hired hand on a farm in her city.  She carries out jobs such as harvesting, planting, irrigation and other tasks.  She works around eight hours a day, every day, and believes things are going well for her because of her dedication and kindness to others.\r\n\r\nMaria is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to renovate her home.  She wants to buy construction materials to put up a fence in the backyard and also put down a concrete floor inside the house.  This will give Maria's family more security and well-being, and will allow her to continue working and striving toward her goal of having a small patch of land where she can grow pecans to sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1387096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To renovate her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"SANTIAGO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.160833 -72.257222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-07-12T11:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-11T11:40:01Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Married"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":203.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":207.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":215.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":227.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":232.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":244.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":251.43},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":261.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":275.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":282.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":293.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":304.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.62,"local_amount":203.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":206.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776410},{"amount":76.11,"local_amount":207.59,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":211.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779373},{"amount":79.08,"local_amount":215.66,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":219.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054567},{"amount":83.26,"local_amount":227.07,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":230.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819469},{"amount":85.39,"local_amount":232.88,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":236.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472413},{"amount":89.6,"local_amount":244.37,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":248.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694892},{"amount":92.19,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":255.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450390929},{"amount":519.75,"local_amount":1417.5,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1441.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067432}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T08:01:26Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":581530,"name":"Bulgan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Bulgan, 33 years old, lives with her husband and two daughters in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

He performs tasks like harvesting, planting, watering, etc.  He works every day for approximately eight hours and believes that everything is going well thanks to his performance and the kindness that he shows others.\r\n\r\nAngel is very thankful for the Kiva loaners.  Thanks to their support, he will be able to buy a computer, which he hopes to be able to use as he begins his studies in computing; he needs to improve his study methods.  He will also continue working and making an effort so that he can realize his greatest dream, which is to have his own commercial business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1387115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a computer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-07-12T13:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-11T13:00:01Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":168.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":172.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":179.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":188.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":193.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":203.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":209.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":217.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":230.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":235.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":245.65},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":254.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.47},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":126.21,"local_amount":341.12,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":350.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054570},{"amount":66.27,"local_amount":179.12,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":183.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819471},{"amount":141.56,"local_amount":382.57,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":392.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472414},{"amount":75.3,"local_amount":203.52,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":208.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694894},{"amount":77.52,"local_amount":209.52,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":215.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450390930},{"amount":438.14,"local_amount":1184.15,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1215.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517510995}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T23:36:56Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T09:46:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Mellace","image":1213464}},{"id":582276,"name":"Nestor Adan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or  Nestor trabaja para una escuela publica desde hace mas 7 a\u00f1os como bibliotecario, actualmente esta cursando una carrera t\u00e9cnica el cual le ayudara a tener mejor oportunidad de superaci\u00f3n e ingresos salarial para seguir apoyando a su familia y salir adelante, solicita a ceprodel un cr\u00e9dito para solventar estos gastos y poder cumplir sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"Nestor has worked for a public school for 7 years as a librarian and he is currently taking a course in a technical career, which will help give him a better chance to earn more money and continue to support his family as well as to get ahead.

recursos econ\u00f3micos, por lo cual tuvo que trabajar desde muy chico para ayudar con los gastos de su casa, por lo cual solo pudo terminar la escuela primaria y con esos conocimientos defenderse en las varias actividades en las cuales emprendi\u00f3.  Actualmente vive en la parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una ciudad que cuenta un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Sus varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros y la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nLuego de una larga trayectoria como comerciante, Jos\u00e9 decidi\u00f3 emprender en la labor que hab\u00eda aprendido como profesi\u00f3n que es la herrer\u00eda, la cual la realiza desde hace 7 a\u00f1os, es un trabajo que le gusta mucho pues al ver que nadie dar\u00eda uso a metales viejos que para muchas personas no son m\u00e1s que chatarra, Jos\u00e9 los somete al fuego y con su creatividad fabrica piezas que sirven como implementos de decoraci\u00f3n de hogares. Jos\u00e9 se siente muy orgulloso cuando uno de sus trabajos terminado y le motiva a seguir creciendo. Sin embargo, como en todo trabajo, hay un riesgo de salud por los residuos de metal que se expulsan y los cambios de temperatura a los que se somete, es por esto que Jos\u00e9 hace alg\u00fan tiempo atr\u00e1s sufri\u00f3 un accidente que lo imposibilit\u00f3 de trabajar durante varios meses, pero al recuperarse empez\u00f3 con nuevas motivaciones. Su sue\u00f1o es establecer un almac\u00e9n en donde pueda vender las piezas fabricadas por sus propias manos y la lucha por ese sue\u00f1o, comenzar\u00e1 con un cr\u00e9dito que solicita el cual lo invertir\u00e1 en la adquisici\u00f3n de metal, chatarra y herramientas que le servir\u00e1n para incrementar su producci\u00f3n y as\u00ed poder ampliar su cartera de clientes. \u00c9ste es un paso que lo acercar\u00e1 cada vez m\u00e1s al cumplimiento de su sue\u00f1o. Jos\u00e9 agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por abrirle las puertas para crecer con su emprendimiento y adem\u00e1s por creer en los sue\u00f1os de las personas del sector rural. Tambi\u00e9n agradece a los inversionistas de Kiva en todo el mundo por su aporte que simbolizan pasos para el desarrollo de los pa\u00edses.","en":"Jos\u00e9 is a 30-year-old man. He is single and grew up in a home with few economic resources, so he had to start working at a very young age in order to help with the household costs. Because of this, he was only able to finish elementary school and has had to get by with this limited education in the various jobs he has taken on. He currently lives in the Rio Verde de Santo Domingo parish, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, a city that has considerable business enterprises because it has become a place of exchange between the coast and the highlands. The several tourist attractions, as well as the hot climate, are a major draw for tourists from Ecuador and around the world. The majority of the residents have some sort of business enterprise or provide services for residents and tourists.\r\nAfter a long career in business, Jos\u00e9 decided to start a business doing what he had learned to do as a career: to be a blacksmith. He has done this work for seven years now. He loves his job. Seeing that no one uses old metal that is nothing more than scrap for many people, Jos\u00e9 puts it into the fire and uses his creativity to create pieces that serve to decorate homes. He is very proud of his finished pieces, and this motivates him to continue expanding his business. However, as in all jobs, there is a health risk because of the metal residues he is exposed to, and because of the temperature changes. Because of this, some time ago Jos\u00e9 suffered an accident that made it impossible for him to work for several months. However, once he recovered, he started again with new motivations.\r\nHis dream is to establish a store where he will be able to sell pieces he has made with his own hands. He is working hard to reach this dream. He will start with this loan, which he will invest in the purchase of metal, scraps, and tools which will allow him to increase production and thus expand his clientele.

To make her store fully stocked, she applied for a loan of PKR 30,000, which she will use to buy rice, sugar and flour from the market at lower prices. In this way, she will be able to meet increasing demand consistently. It\u2019s her second year with Kashf Foundation. She hopes to have a good experience with this new loan and wishes to use part of her revenues to increase her business capital.

Besides that, the family grows haricot beans, maize and potatoes and uses the harvested product for feeding. \r\nElene applied for loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan applications were always rejected because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nHer loan application was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. With the credit, Elene will buy various cosmetics, including talcs, body lotions, perfumes and face powders. She will distribute these products among her friends and neighbors. She also plans to sell medicines as there is no drugstore in her village. This business will help her to increase her income and profits.

is 53 years old. She lives in the small village of Gori District with her daughter. Sopio requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nSopio is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, she has a plot of agricultural land where different kinds of fruits are grown. Such as: peach trees, plum trees, cornel trees and strawberries. Sopio and her daughter look after the fruit to insure in a good harvest. Besides, Sopio has a flat which is rented out and she gets 200 Gel per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nSopio requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Sopio has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Sopio will begin selling clothing and household goods.

By this time, she has established a good clientele but is now having difficulty in fulfilling large orders from her customers on time.\r\n\r\n For this reason, she requested for a loan of Rs. 35,000 to buy a stock of thread in different colors with some packs of zippers and buttons to meet the increasing demand. She is in her fifth loan cycle and has shown good repayment behavior. She hopes to have a good experience with this new loan and wishes to use part of the revenues to deal with personal expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1385156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

daughter and three sons). She is raising the children on her own, and her ex-husband is not involved in the children's upbringing. \r\n\r\nShe began practicing cattle breeding eight years ago in 2005, starting with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Today, through her perseverance and determination she is receiving a monthly profit of 13,000 som (KGS). On her farm, she has: one cow, one calf, and additionally is involved in arable farming on 2.0 hectares where she grows beans. \r\n\r\nSaadat's eldest son helps her materially; he works in the capital of Kyrgyzstan and every month sends his salary to his mother to support the family.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Eteri will open a grocery shop.

Teona\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

","en":"Shahnoza is a hardworking woman.  She is 39 years old, married and has four children.  For more than 11 years she has worked in agriculture: livestock and farming.  She is the main breadwinner for her family since her husband is a immigrant worker in Russia.  Her sons also work in Russia.  Shahnoza runs her business alone.  She buys cattle, fattens them over a few months and then resells them at a local market at a higher price.

He has two sons and a daughter.  His wife is a homemaker and he works as a duty telephonist at a pumping station.  For additional income, he and his wife breed livestock at their home--they have cows and calves.  Abduaziz wants to sell a cow and with the profits, he plans to buy two calves.  However, since his cow is still producing milk, he doesn't want to sell it just yet.  His income from his job is not enough to buy a cow, so he decided to take out a loan with Arvand.  He plans to increase his herd and expand his business.  Fattening cows provides good profits.  Abduaziz's oldest son helps his parents with their business.

He has ten years\u2019 experience caring for and managing grazing cattle.  He learned this from his father since he used to send him to care for the animals and do farm chores when he was a little boy; he also learned how to build metal structures but there isn\u2019t much work in that.  Because of the poverty level they found themselves in they found in field work their only source of income to support the family.  Rudy was never sent to school so his probability of finding a good job is remote which is why he spends all his time caring for his calves and his crops to insure that his family does not lack food even if it\u2019s only rice and beans.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy his calves he must take a bus in is community that several people use to go buy.  He travels for 45 minutes and when he gets to the market he has to choose the animals he likes which can sometimes take all day.  When he finds the calves he has to find a truck to take them to his community; he loads the animals and returns home.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy four grazing calves to fatten up, to increase his herd size so that he can continue selling animals once they have been fattened up.  In this way his income will increase because it\u2019s logical that if the sale of calves is continuous so too will his income be greater and this will help so that his family will at least have their food assured as well as the repayment of the loan.  Rudy plans to save so that his children can study much and also to enlarge his house because it\u2019s very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1387240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy four calves to fatten up.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-12T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-11T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rudy Alexis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1025,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":1025,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243656}],"funded_date":"2013-08-09T02:36:45Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:19:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":582328,"name":"Dina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dina, de 59 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer trabajadora y empe\u00f1osa, es viuda hace 23 a\u00f1os y vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus 2 hijos de 35 y 26 a\u00f1os de edad quienes la acompa\u00f1an y apoyan, habitando su propia casa.

She was born and grew up in a poor family.  since her childhood, she has helped her parents work in agriculture.  Therefore, she has much experience in the field since farming is still her main source of income.  For more than 20 years this has been her business alone.  Oltin mostly grows watermelon, rice and corn.  She also works with livestock since the income from farming isn't enough to provide for the family.  she is married and has three children.  Her husband helps her run the business.  Oltin wants to expand the business further and sell her products of high quality to locals.  She is asking for a loan of 6,000 KGS to buy mineral fertilizers and cattle.  She awaits your kindness.

","en":"Azamat is an enterprising, young man of 23 years. He is married, but does not yet have children. Azamat resides with his wife and parents in the village district of Shahrituz. Azamat decided to start a cattle breeding business, namely in raising beef cattle. This is a very profitable business, as the costs for caring for cattle are small and the demand for meat and meat products is consistently high.\r\n\r\nAzamat has a business plan for cattle breeding. He plans to buy five heads of cattle each month, to fatten them for one month and then to put them out for sale at the local cattle market. Azamat works in a micro-deposit organization and has an accumulated savings of 2,100 somoni. However, in order to realize his objective, this sum is not sufficient and so he turned to HUMO for a loan. With the accumulated savings and loan, he wants to get five heads of cattle and their feed. \r\n\r\nAzamat promises to repay the loan on time. His parents, who have a lot of experience in this area, will help run the business. This loan will help Azamat to start his own family business and to significantly improve their quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1385677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

The area is home to \u201cround time marketers,\u201d the local term for traders who travel to the interior regions of the country to purchase goods to sell throughout the county.

By profession, she is a seamstress. For more than nine years, Takhmina has been sewing women's national dresses and gowns. She takes orders from her home. Since she sews beautifully, efficiently and quickly, she has many customers. \r\n\r\nAt the same time,  Takhmina teaches those who wish to know how to cut and sew at the training center. Currently, Takhmina wants to expand her activities. She is requesting a loan to purchase a computerized sewing machine and fabric, and also partly for home renovations. \r\n\r\nTakhmina knows how to do embroidery on dresses and now wants to put her skills into practice. Since dresses with embroidery are more expensive, Takhmina will generate more income from her activities that will allow her to improve living conditions and to promote her activities further.

He is in a relationship and has two children. He is a very hard-working man who struggles day to day for a better future for his family. For ten years, he has dedicated himself 100 percent to agriculture. Since he was five years old, he has known the trade, which his grandfather taught to him. Previously he worked in a factory that produced sacks for agave crops. He lives with his wife and his children.\r\n\r\nHe has to travel about 10 kilometers from his home to be able to buy necessities for his crop, which is very tiring since for his age it is very difficult for him. Because of this, he has to pay to be taken since he cannot use so much of his strength.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 12 sacks of fertilizer that he will use on his corn crop; he has 21,000 square meters of land available to cultivate.

is a widow with six children, and they live in a three bedroom apartment in Bamenda Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. She has faced so many challenges, among which are inadequate finance to carry out her business and cater for her family needs, the death of loved ones, and other family issues.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan in buying baby dresses, jackets, and hangers and renting benches. She holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has been in this business for a long time, has a good business site, and sells high quality dresses. This business will benefit the community because it will help them to look good through the high quality dresses that she is selling. \r\n\r\nWith the help of the loan, she will continue to educate her children, to cater for her family needs, to add her capital for a bigger investment, and also to give thanks to the Almighty God.  She prefers loans from GHAPE because of low interest rates and convenient repayment intervals as well as the fact that the members are trained on marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1385967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy dresses for sale.

Jemma has never worked, but she manages the farm together with her son. After many years of hard and devoted work they own a big and productive farm with ten cows, heifers, eleven bulls, ten calves, and twenty chickens. They also have a large plot of land on which they mainly cultivate potatoes. Jemma sends her farm milk to a very famous company in Armenian dairy products, and the meat her son sells to local butchers. Together with her husband\u2019s occasional help, Jemma\u2019s farm income barely covers the expanses of her family and farm.\r\n\r\nJemma is requesting a loan in order to buy a hay mowing machine; she also plans to buy three cows.

This work now allows them to provide for their families. The members are women who work hard every day in order to improve their quality of life and provide their children with a better future. They still maintain the culture and traditions of their people. They live on the outskirts of the Valle parish in Cuenca, an area surrounded by a great deal of vegetation.\r\nOne of the group members is Blanca. She is taking out her first loan with her friends and fellow members of the Pucacruz group.\r\nBlanca is 31, married, and has four children ages 2, 4, 11, and 13. Her eldest is in high school; her second-eldest is in school; and her youngest two children stay home under her care. Her husband has followed in his father's footsteps as a bricklayer. They live in their own home.\r\nBlanca has done farmwork from a very young age. She learned this work from her mother. She raises animals such as guinea pigs, chickens, and livestock. She also farms for her family's consumption and for sale.\r\nShe will invest the money from this loan in the purchase of seeds, manure, and animal feed.\r\nHer goal is to improve the quality of her animals in order to obtain a greater income.\r\nThe small inserted photo is of a member who was unable to be present when the group photo was

","en":"Anvar is a person with an earnest soul. He has been working hard from a young age. While his friends were playing in the yard, he was helping his parents process apricots. As he became older, he began working in apricot processing on his own. Because he has a lot of experience, he is successful in his business. He purchases apricots, processes them, and sells them as dried fruit at the local market. He is familiar with all the details of his business, so his product is of high quality. His wife Gulzora helps him with the business.  His wife is a very hardworking woman, and they are raising 2 young children. The children are named Malika and Amir.

In addition he is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has a milking cow and two calves, whose milk is used to make cheese products.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMurtuzali requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-up and re-startup with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. With the credit Murtuzali will purchase additional cows. As additional cows are purchased, the family will be able to produce more cheese products and thus increase their income.

His primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming,  'Its a source of income for his financial needs'  His biggest challenge is, 'Lack of market, poor roads.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of  'Maritati.'\r\n\r\nLawrence was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied,  'Interest rate is low.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session,  'Interest rate is customer friendly, it meets his financial target.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Lawrence replied, 'It improved their living standard.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Lawrence owns  ' cows,  poultry, and a bicycle' but does not own 'pigs, a pump, a motorcycle, or an automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, TV, or DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

Badri requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family, aside from the pension of Badri's mother,  is their agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. In addition, they have a vineyard and 600 nut trees. They sell approximately 1500 kg of grapes and 600 kg of nuts, seasonally. They earn hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBadri requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Badri has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits. with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Badri will purchase a car. After the car is purchased, Badri will be able to trade in fruits and vegetables. He will use his car to transport in different villages, and thus increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1386001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a car and use it to transport fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ukhuti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-12T23:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-11T23:10:06Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Badri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":98.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":106.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":107.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":109.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":116.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.24},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":123.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":127.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":132.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":136.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":138.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":141.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":146.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":151.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":154.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.9,"local_amount":89.9,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":89.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857564},{"amount":98.17,"local_amount":98.17,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":98.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134213},{"amount":2811.93,"local_amount":2811.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2811.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107796}],"funded_date":"2013-08-11T22:06:05Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:49:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":581739,"name":"Maka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maka is 35 years-old, married and lives with her husband and 13 year-old son in littoral city-Batumi. \r\n\r\nMaka\u2019s husband is a mini-bus driver and gets a monthly income.

His primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"It's a source of income for my household needs.\" His biggest challenge is lack of market, poor roads, and drought. One of the animals on his farm has been given the name Nyang'era.\r\n\r\nJoseph chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because it meets his financial needs. When he was asked what he learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, he said \"It's customer friendly, and rates are low.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Joseph said that it will be a source of capital to improve their living standard.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Joseph owns the following: a cow, poultry, and a motorcycle. He does not own a pig, a pump, a bicycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. Joseph has in his household a mosquito net, solar power, a TV, and a DVD player, but he does not have electricity, running water, or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1386070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-07-13T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-12T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2243.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2303.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2363.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2426.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2490.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2556.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2623.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2693.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2764.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2837.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2912.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2989.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.43,"local_amount":1450.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1514.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417409},{"amount":27.81,"local_amount":2313.62,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2415.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980928},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":2374.78,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2478.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880977},{"amount":40.03,"local_amount":3330.55,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3476.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529594},{"amount":30.36,"local_amount":2525.59,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2636.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753466},{"amount":36.65,"local_amount":3049.24,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-26T09:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3183.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449658000},{"amount":88.26,"local_amount":7343.43,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7665.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343354},{"amount":35.85,"local_amount":2982.59,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3113.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467943920},{"amount":70.07,"local_amount":5829.64,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":6085.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479164902}],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T23:20:33Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T12:14:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":581780,"name":"Pola","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pola is married and has three children, all of whom attend school and are under her care.

He would like to purchase larger quantities of silver to increase production.\r\n\r\nDario has been selling through NOVICA since 2006. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I began helping out in a jewelry workshop when I was 15, during school vacations. Little by little, this activity became a passion. I realized how much I enjoyed working with meticulous details and eventually found a great deal of satisfaction in creating jewelry that people liked. Beauty can be expressed in different forms and manners. The challenge for a country like Peru is to get ahead little by little, despite the many difficult circumstances that exist. It's important that people appreciate the art of jewelry, as many don't value the effort it requires.\"\r\n\r\n\"We all need a helping hand once in a while, and it is nice to know we can always count on a friendly hand.

In Pakistan, the rainy season has started, and due to monsoons the boundary wall of the fish farm cracked. His farm filled with rainwater and began to flow out from the fish farm. Many fish were also carried away with the water. Now he wants more fish for his fish farm, but he does not have enough money to buy fish. \r\n\r\nFor this purpose, Maryam contacted Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband would be able to buy more fish for his fish farm. Maryam hopes that this loan will prove beneficial for her family and effect positive changes upon their lives. Her dream is to provide better facilities and higher qualifications to her children. She is very thankful to Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nNote: Maryam stands on the left side in the

She has a lot of experience and steadily develops her business. Gulruhsor has a retail stall at the local market and tries to sell beautiful and well-made children's clothes. She needs to refresh her inventory for the upcoming season but has no money.
