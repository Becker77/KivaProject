donde su padre siempre la hac\u00eda participar y ayudar en el negocio de la familia en el mercado local. Martha se cas\u00f3 muy joven, matrimonio del cual nacieron su hijos a quienes despu\u00e9s de una dura pero inevitable separaci\u00f3n, tuvo que educarlos sola a veces neg\u00e1ndose el sustento para s\u00ed misma, pero su esfuerzo vali\u00f3 la pena, pues sus hijos son independientes y lo aprendido lo han puesto en pr\u00e1ctica para desenvolverse en su caminar. Cuando Martha se cas\u00f3, se traslad\u00f3 a Quito la capital de los ecuatorianos, en donde actualmente vive con una de sus hijas, espec\u00edficamente en el barrio llamado \u201cChillogallo\u201d ubicado al sur de la ciudad, sector que hasta hace pocos a\u00f1os no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles, un sector en el cual su alta actividad comercial es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios.\nMartha siempre se ha dedicado a la comercializaci\u00f3n de frutas y verduras, sin embargo hace 5 a\u00f1os encontr\u00f3 un lugar en el mercado local, en donde va a ofertar sus productos los d\u00edas de feria es decir martes, viernes y s\u00e1bado. Esto ha incrementado sus ventas pero ha demandado de ella un mayor esfuerzo, pues a su edad el traslado de los bultos llenos de frutas y verduras, es m\u00e1s complicados de trasladarse, pues ella debe tener un especial cuidado por el tema de su salud. Martha utiliza los conocimientos obtenidos de su preparaci\u00f3n primaria para llevar a cabo su negocio. Invierte cada d\u00eda varias horas para hacer los pedidos respectivos a sus proveedores y hacer las ventas respectivas y mucho tiempo m\u00e1s en los d\u00edas de feria. En los \u00faltimos d\u00edas ha percibido una falta de variedad en sus productos, pues muchos de sus clientes tienen que completar su canasta en otros puestos del mercado. Por esta raz\u00f3n, Martha ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo con el fin de invertir en nuevos productos y as\u00ed ampliar su negocio, adem\u00e1s as\u00ed podr\u00eda obtener el dinero adicional tener un lugar m\u00e1s grande dentro del mercado. Martha afirma que muchas veces este sue\u00f1o no pudo ser posible por la falta de capital y adem\u00e1s por la dificultad y obst\u00e1culos que ponen las instituciones financieras, por el contrario Martha encontr\u00f3 en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa el apoyo para su microempresa, de tal forma que se sinti\u00f3 importante tanto para su ejecutivo de cuenta como para la entidad.  Ella estuvo de acuerdo en aplicar al producto de Kiva para que as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n pueda sentir el apoyo de varias personas alrededor del mundo que todav\u00eda creen en los sue\u00f1os y esfuerzo de las personas del sector \u201cmicro\u201d.","en":"Martha is a 63-year-old woman. She grew up in the country with her family. Her father always made her participate and help in the family business in the local market. Martha married very young, and from her marriage came her children, who are now independent of her after a difficult but inevitable parting. She had to educate them by herself and sometimes did not have enough to eat, but her effort was worth it and they have learnt to fend for themselves. When Martha married, she moved to Quito, the capital of Ecuador, and she currently lives there with one of her daughters in the neighbourhood called \u201cChillogallo\u201d in the southern part of the city. This area was not counted among the strong economic areas of the capital of the Republic of Ecuador until recently, but it is now considered an economic force in the capital. It is here that you can find enterprising families who have fought to get ahead. It has been the meeting point between inhabitants of various provinces, natives, and immigrants from other cities and countries. It has been rebuilt to have wide streets. The high commercial activity of this area is constantly strengthening and it contributes greatly to the economic growth of the city. There are also large parks in this zone, where families meet during the weekend. There is great accessibility to all types of services and the inhabitants are enterprising and take every opportunity that presents itself to establish new businesses.\r\n\r\nMartha has always made a living by selling fruit and vegetables; however, five years ago she found a place in a local market, where she sells her produce on market days (Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday). This has increased her sales but it requires more effort on her part. At her age transporting the packages full of fruit and vegetables is more complicated, and she must take special care of her health. Martha uses the knowledge she learnt in primary school to run her business. She invests several hours each day in making orders to her suppliers and making sales, and more time on market days. She has recently noticed a lack of variety in her produce and that many of her clients have to complete their shopping at other stalls in the market. For this reason, Martha has requested a loan with the goal of investing in new products and expanding her business, thereby enabling her to obtain additional money in order to get a larger place in the market. Martha states that many times this dream was not possible due to the lack of capital and because of the difficulties and obstacles financial institutions put in place. With Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, Martha found the support for her microbusiness in such a way that she felt important for both being the account executor and to the entity. She agreed to apply to Kiva so that she could also feel the support of various people around the world who still believe in the dreams and efforts of people in the \u201cmicro\u201d sector."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1387929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Marcelino is very well-known in his community as a responsible young man with good moral values.\r\n\r\nHe buys his supplies in town, and for that he has to travel more than 54 kilometers. He covers this distance on the community's collective transport, a means of transportation that drives through the community four times during the day.

He's a regular customer and gets the prices at the moment of buying the supplies.\r\n\r\nThe loan he's requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n is to purchase fertilizer, compost, pesticide and herbicide, and to pay for the cleaning of the field so he can grow 7,000 square meters of corn.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary needs he has to satisfy is obtaining profits for his family, who depends almost exclusively on this business. Besides, he has to ensure a monthly income after selling the harvest.\r\nHe wishes to improve his family's diet and financial stability, and also provide work for the members of his family, since it's a business that brings them together as a family. He'll also improve his living conditions and turn a higher profit.\r\n\r\nHis wish is to provide better education for his younger brother.

On average, they are 38 years old and have three children each. They all live in the village of Fabougou, in the region of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of Mali). They know one another through their seasonal farm work and also through neighborhood, marriage and family ties within the village. They grow groundnuts, millet and rice.\r\n\r\nThey have joined Soro Yiriwaso in order to buy small tools and farm inputs, and they are on their second farming loan.\r\n\r\nHawa (seated first from the right in the photo) is an important leader of farming activities during the rainy season in the village of Fabougou. She plans to use her loan to plow her field, to buy seeds and fertilizers, and then to hire some young people for weeding.\r\n\r\nShe sells her crops for cash at the end of the rainy season and this allows her to repay her loan and have enough revenues to take care of her children and, to some extent, of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1386775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy seeds and farm inputs, and to pay for labor.

She lives with her husband Emzar and daughter Rusudan. She is actively involved in agricultural activities with her family members. They have a milk cow, 3 pigs, 3 horses, 2 goats and 4 bee-hives with bee-colonies. Besides that, the family owns a plot of agricultural land, where maize, potatoes and nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price. \r\n\r\nLiana requested 1100 GEL from Credo to start-up another family business. Liana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

been raising cattle for over 25 years. Even when he was very young, he helped his parents take care of cattle. Similarly, his children now help him by bringing feed, herding cattle in the pasture and milking cows. Abduvali's wife stays at home, but seasonally, from July to November, she buys grapes from farmers, stores them in a refrigerated warehouse and sells them on the market. While Abduvali's sons herd cattle in the pasture, he goes to work as a painter. The livestock gives Abduvali's family a good income, so the whole family is working on growing the business.\r\n\r\nSince his pasture is full of grass and lot of diverse food, Abduvali plans to buy another pair of cows for additional breeding. To achieve this, he turned to the Arvand organization and hopes for their financial support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1375870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-07-13T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-12T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abduvali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":581.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":601.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":621.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":642.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":664.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":687.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":710.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":734.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":759.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":785.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":811.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.65},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Max Prilutsky","image":1270958}},{"id":582130,"name":"Razia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Razia, age 61, deals in the business of animal sales.

Her products are very good quality, and she sells the harvests at the different markets that are close to where she lives.\r\n\r\nAll of the family members work hard, but the income is not enough for covering the everyday expenses. So, Nineli decided to start up a new business. She has requested loans from her local financial institutions several times without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Nineli will build a greenhouse. She will purchase building materials and construct it. Nineli will plant different kinds of greens and vegetables, which will be sold by her at a good price. This will increase her income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

With limited career options, due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, she is one of the many Iraqi women who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has ten years of experience with her home based sewing business activity, and to improve the services she can offer her customers as well as improve her work conditions she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine. To be able to make this purchase she took a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq offers 'group loans' for clients unable to provide a guarantor, and therefore unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group.\r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about these borrowers has been altered for their protection. Relief International Microfinance Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi borrowers.

Gulnora, as she lives in a rural area together with her family, works with livestock breeding. She has worked with this business for 10 years already. She has a large experience and teaches her children this business. Her children, Burkhon, Oyzoda, Khudoyberdi and Rahmonberdi, and also her husband Rauf, help her with managing the business. This business is the main source of income for her large family and their only hope for the future. \r\n\r\nGulnora started building a new house several years ago, for her eldest son and his future wife. She would like to marry away her son, but first she should finish the house. Gulnora plans to complete the building before the winter. With this aim she applied for a loan, in order to purchase cement, wood, brick, armature and so on. She requests a loan in the amount of 3,000 US dollar. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1387533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials such as cement, brick, wood and armature, for building house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-07-13T22:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-12T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":98.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":106.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":107.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":115.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":113.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":114.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":128.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":131.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":137.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":138.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":144.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":148.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":153.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":157.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":161.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":582172,"name":"Mwanaisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanaisha is a hardworking woman who works hard to meet the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nHer previous Kiva loan helped her to boost her business.

It is located 2 kilometers from their house, and they walk there daily.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Eulalia is requesting a loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative to help her maintain her crops and keep them free of pests and diseases.  She will buy various farming supplies to help her make this possible. \r\n\r\nEulalia's plans for the future include improving her harvests by installing an irrigation system and keeping her crops healthy, clean and attractive to her customers.  In this way, she will leave her children property that has been improved, so that they will be able to face future economic challenges in a favorable way.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1388035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

To begin her business, Latonya used her savings to start but needed extra money to continue.  \r\n\r\nA current Accion Texas Inc. borrower informed Latonya about the nonprofit microlender and encouraged her to apply for a microloan.  Once Latonya applied and received approval, she used her $5,450 to purchase toys, equipment, pay license fees, and fix up her residence to open the daycare.  \r\n\r\nLatonya feels strongly that her daycare will continue to succeed because there are similar daycares in her community.  She understands families need the option to have reliable care for their children close to their home or work.\r\n\r\nLatonya\u2019s future plans include expanding into the central Alexandria area and being at full capacity in a few months.

Es un hombre soltero que vive en  Pastaza, un cant\u00f3n ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta peque\u00f1a ciudad. En cada negocio se encuentra personas que no se han dado por vencidas frente a la falta de empleo sino que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio para llevar una vida digna y hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os.\nSergio luego de adquirir algo de experiencia en el comercio decidi\u00f3 establecer su propio negocio en su ciudad, se trata de la venta de llantas y repuestos de veh\u00edculos que lo ejerce desde hace 15 a\u00f1os y lo aprendi\u00f3 gracias a un primo quien le ayud\u00f3 con los contactos de proveedores y adem\u00e1s lo motiv\u00f3 a emprender con esta actividad. Ahora invierte al menos 5 horas en la atenci\u00f3n del local, pero se complica y se extiende la jornada laboral cuando tiene que hacer cobranzas con sus clientes, pues no todos pagan de contado y puntualmente. Sin embargo, Sergio ha aprendido herramientas que le ayudan a administrar mejor su negocio, gracias a la asesor\u00eda del ejecutivo de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde ahora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 variedad de repuestos al por mayor, formando parte de las promociones y mayores descuentos que los proveedores ofrecen a las compras mayores. En anteriores ocasiones, Sergio no pudo obtener el capital por no poseer las altas garant\u00edas que le exig\u00edan en algunas instituciones, pero gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa que a trav\u00e9s de su producto de Kiva pueden dar una mano a emprendedores microempresarios y de zonas rurales; \u00e9l podr\u00e1 hacer realidad su sue\u00f1o de tener una microempresa y con las ganancias poder retomar sus estudios y prepararse en el \u00e1rea comercial y financiera. ","en":"Sergio is 29 years old and has learned to always get ahead thanks to the example of his parents.  He has always worked in commercial jobs since his charisma helps him a lot with sales.  He started to work when he finished secondary school since his family had started to have financial problems that did not allow him to go to university and he wanted to help with the household expenses.  \r\n\r\nHe is a single man who lives in Pastaza, a canton located in the Pastaza province, which is located in the Amazon region of Ecuador.  The capital of the canton is the city of Puyo, which is a city located in the middle of the Amazon jungle on the western side of the province of Pastaza, and 924 meters above sea level. The city has a small population, but it has a large variety of sites that draw Ecuadorian and international tourists, including ecological activities and extreme sports.  The city grows economically every day from commerce, livestock, agriculture, and tourism activities.  Branches of financial and commercial companies have been established there to take advantage of the economic activity that supports this small city.  In each business, there are people who have not given up on the lack of jobs but have come up with ideas for businesses so that they can live a decent life and realize their dreams.\r\n\r\nAfter Sergio acquired some sales experience, he decided to start his own business in the city.  He sells tires and spare parts for vehicles.  He has done this for 15 years, and learned thanks to a cousin to helped him with the contracts for vendors and motivated him to start this business.  Now, he spends at least five hours at the shop each day, but his day is made longer when he has to make collections from his customers since not everyone pays in cash and on time.  \r\n\r\nSergio has learned tools that help him administer his business better thanks to the advice from Fundacion Alternativa.  Now he is requesting a loan to purchase a variety of spare parts at wholesale.  This will allow him to take advantage of promotions and better discounts that vendors offer for wholesale purchases.  Previously, Sergio was not able to get a loan because he did not have the high guarantees that those institutions request.  Thanks to Fundacion Alternativa through their product with Kiva, they can give a hand to small business owners in rural areas so that Sergio can make his dream of having a small business a reality.  With his earnings, he can go back to school and study business and finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1388023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase tires and spare parts at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pastaza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-14T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-13T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergio Leonardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1023.5,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":505.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":518.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":505.98,"local_amount":505.24,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":505.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565430},{"amount":519.02,"local_amount":518.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":519.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814467}],"funded_date":"2013-07-14T19:04:35Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":582961,"name":"D\u00fao Solidario El Pilar Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"DUO SOLIDARIO EL PILAR\n\nANA ES SOLTERA TIENE  21 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD, INICIO SU NEGOCIO HACE TRES A\u00d1OS CUANDO DECIDIO TERMINAR  DE ESTUDIAR  Y TENER UN INGRESO ELLA SE DEDICA A LA VENTA DE ALMUERZOS EN SU DOMICILIO, EN UN PEQUE\u00d1O LUGAR TIENE SU PEQUE\u00d1O COMERDO ELLA DESEA COMPRAR MOBILIARIO Y EQUIPO PARA SU NEGOCIO YA QUE EL QUE EL EQUIPO QUE TIENE NO ES SUFICIENTE. \nELLA DESEA SEGUIR ESTUDIANDO EN PLAN FIN DE SEMANA Y ASI TERMINAR SU CARRERA A NIVEL MEDIO, ESTA MUY CONTENTA POR QUE SU NEGOCIO ES MUY RENTABLE, PRIMERO ESPERA CRESER MAS EN SU NEGOCIO Y LUEGO CUANDO TENGA LA SUFICIENTE GANANCIAS PONERSE A ESTUDIAR Y ASI CON SU TRABAJO SOSTENER SUS ESTUDIOS ESPERA QUE LE PUEDAN AYUDAR CON EL CREDITO SOLICITADO.","en":"Duo Solidario El Pilar (Supportive Duo Pillar)\r\n\r\nAna is by herself as a 21 year-old.

Pakistan. She belongs to a poor family, as her whole family is fully dependent upon a single earning person and a single source of income as well. Her husband has owned a small general store in a nearby hometown for 12 years.\r\n\r\nHer husband is facing a problem with his daily sales and is unable to fulfill the demands of his daily customers due to a shortage of stock. The causes of the shortage of those inventories are that Sobia herself uses all of her household necessities from her husband's general store, and because most of the customers like to buy commodities on a credit basis.\r\n \r\nSobia wants to fill the requirements of stock in her husband's general store, and that is why she requested a loan, so that her husband would be able to buy those inventories. Sobia hopes that this loan will bring positive changes to the general store so that she can manage her household expenses through earned income. She is very happy and glad after taking this loan, and she is very thankful to BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nNote: Sobia is raising her hand in the picture.

He is married and has five children, ages 6 to 16. \r\n\r\nEglecerio's main livelihood is through fishing. This business started 10 years ago. Eglecerio is struggling to meet the needs of his family while maintaining his business. \r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan of 17,000 PHP to buy fish net.

Her partner is Boni, a construction worker. She and her partner manage their household while operating the business. She works hard to provide income for her everyday expenses. Jovy operates a food stall. \r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only in the evenings, when all the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two people while when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. \r\n\r\nJovy\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day. To help her continue operating her business, she is applying for a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more ingredients, such as meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products.\r\n\r\nJovy hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life. Every week, she goes to meetings with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1387452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for ingredients, including rice, pork, chicken, vegetables and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-07-14T15:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-13T15:20:08Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jovy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6326.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534943},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6326.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784339},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771325},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":11249.99,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":11387.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478243},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1265.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757513}],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T09:36:07Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:11:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":582419,"name":"Etelani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Etelani is 55 years old, married, and has four children.

actividad que realiza desde hace mas de 20 a\u00f1os, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 de su difunto padre por lo cual \u00e9l se siente orgulloso de desarrollar esta actividad, adem\u00e1s de tener en cuenta que la clientela que mantiene es muy grande porque no solamente abarca el cant\u00f3n sino que \u00e9l se desplaza a los cantones aleda\u00f1os o cercanos al que le reside.  \n\nLos productos los adquiere en la ciudad; por lo que tiene que desplazarse m\u00e1s de 54 kil\u00f3metros, distancia que recorre en el transporte colectivo, los productos los compra en los diferentes almacenes de esta ciudad en algunos le dan precios bajos porque compra al mayoreo. Para comprar, los mariscos se tiene que desplazar hasta la playa el cuco que se encuentra a 25 minutos de donde \u00e9l vive dicha actividad comercial la realiza 2 veces por semana.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar m\u00e1s art\u00edculos de cocina y mariscos; ya que por la cantidad de clientela que \u00e9l tiene muchas veces se queda sin producto para poder satisfacer las necesidades de sus clientes adem\u00e1s quiere reparar parte de la vivienda donde reside; por que se encuentra la parte trasera de esta en un estado de deterior\u00f3 muy alto al punto que la pared est\u00e1 a punto de caerse y quiere mitigar ese riesgo en su vivienda.\n\nUna de las primeras necesidades en satisfacer es la obtenci\u00f3n de ingresos a la familia adem\u00e1s de asegurar un mejor bienestar para su familia ya que con la reparaci\u00f3n de la pared \u00e9l podr\u00e1 omitir en totalidad el riesgo que actualmente corren con la pared en mal estado, adem\u00e1s otra de las necesidades a satisfacer son los nuevos productos que podr\u00e1 ofrecer a sus clientes ya que muchos de ellos le piden art\u00edculos que por falta de dinero no puede conseguir. \n\nEntre sus planes esta, construir una vivienda m\u00e1s segura; ya que actualmente en la que residen est\u00e1 un poco deteriorada por el paso del tiempo, adem\u00e1s el sue\u00f1a con una familia con ingresos estables, con mejores oportunidades de educaci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n quiere comprar una peque\u00f1a canoa ya que donde el reside se encuentra a unos pocos metros la laguna de OLOMEGA, para poder pescar y poder incrementar sus ingresos.\n\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Julio is single and 34 years old. He is well known in the community as a responsible young man with good values. He sells seafood, kitchen items, household appliances, and more as a traveling salesperson. He has been doing this work for more than 20 years, an activity he learned from his late father which is why he is proud to be cultivating this work. In addition, he has a large clientele because he not only covers the canton but travels to surrounding or nearby cantons to where he lives.\r\n\r\nHe buys his supplies in the city so he has to travel more than 54 kilometers, a distance he makes by public transport, buying products in various stores in the city where some of them give him lower prices for buying in bulk.\r\n\r\nTo buy the seafood he goes to the beach which by the clock is about 25 minutes away from where he lives, a trip he makes twice a week.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting through Fundaci\u00f3n Camp is to buy more kitchen items and seafood because he has so many customers that sometimes he does not have the products they need and he also wants to make repairs to his home where he lives. The back part is in such a high state of deterioration that the wall is on the point of collapsing and he wants to mitigate that risk to his home.\r\n\r\nOne of the first needs to satisfy is to obtain family earnings while ensuring a better quality of life for his family because by repairing the wall he will be able to entirely remove the risk they run with the wall in a bad state. Also, another need to satisfy is buying new products so he can offer his customers what many of them ask for which he can\u2019t get without money. \r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to build a more secure home, as currently where they live has somewhat deteriorated over time, he dreams of having stable family income, and better opportunities for education. He also hopes to buy a little canoe as he lives close to the Olomega lagoon, in order to fish and be able to increase his earnings."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1388139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more kitchen items and seafood to sell in his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-14T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-13T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":36.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":44.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":54.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":55.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":60.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":62.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":63.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":65.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":582393,"name":"Shabana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shabana is a 36-year-old married woman, living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

The start-up loan program envisions the provision of a business start-up and re-start-up credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the amount Gulnazi is asking for, she will buy more merchandise and have a well-stocked store.

Her husband has to work very hard to feed his family.  Recently, the welding plant was shut down because of broken machinery and her husband has been unable to work and earn money.\r\n\r\nShabana humbly requests a loan of RS 45,000 from BRAC Pakistan. This will allow her husband to buy new welding tools and reopen his business. Shabana wants to establish a decent standard of living for her family.
