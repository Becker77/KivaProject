Her husband is a hawker and sells fresh vegetables door-to-door in the streets. He is very famous in town due to the freshness of his vegetables. Her husband is a very hard worker. He has to go to the vegetable market to purchase fresh vegetables early in the morning every day. A few days ago, her husband's cart collided with a car and the cart was damaged. Some vegetables were also smashed because of this accident. Now, her husband wants to repair the cart and align the wheels of the cart. He also wants to purchase vegetables such as lady fingers, lemons, tomatoes, potatoes, cauliflower and green chillies. Mahjabeen does not have her kith and kin in Lahore from whom to borrow some money. Mahjabeen has requested a loan of 28,000 PKR from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan. Her husband will spend a portion of this amount to repair the cart and the rest to buy fresh vegetables to sell.\r\n\r\nMahjabeen wants a proper vegetable shop for her husband, instead of a cart.

the age of 51, Nusrat is successfully running a business of popcorn sales. She deliciously makes popcorn at home, and after packaging, she supplies the popcorn in the local market.  She has been doing this for many years and makes a good amount of income through her business.\r\n\r\nTo increase her supply, she needs to purchase another machine for popcorn making, with some packages of salt and unpopped corn.

There are times when he drives in the late evening until the wee hours in order to have bigger profits. His regular customers are his neighbours and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 1,200 in his transportation business every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting an amount of PHP 20,000 for his loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy motorcycle parts for the maintenance of his four tricycle units. He has to maintain his unit in good condition in order to have a regular income for the daily needs of his family. \r\n\r\nJuan dreams of having an additional source of income and hopes his child will finish his studies. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1387628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for spare parts and maintenance of his tricycle unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-07-15T01:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-14T01:20:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":138.54,"local_amount":5833,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5996.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534948},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":3333.63,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3427.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784345},{"amount":98.96,"local_amount":4166.65,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4283.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771331},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3427.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824380},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":3333.4,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3427.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478248}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T04:00:09Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:49:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Francine Abes","image":454244}},{"id":582570,"name":"Nilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nilda is 50 years old and married with four children.

She is a friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who devotes all her efforts to raising her son, as she is both father and mother to him.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and because she needed to start working at a young age, Yanina was unable to study to become a teacher as she would have liked.  In her free time she likes to watch movies, and sometimes cooks a delicious pork dish called \"Chicharron de Chancho\" to share with her family.  On her own initiative, and with great effort and dedication, Yanina works as an agricultural laborer on a farm in her city.  Her work includes sowing, irrigating, harvesting and other farming tasks. Yanina works every day, starting early in the morning, and for appoximately 10 hours.  She likes her work and believes that she is doing well at it because of her good job performance and because of the friendly way in which she treats others.  Yanina is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help she will be able to  buy a stove.  She currently prepares food on a wood-burning stove, which is dangerous for her to use.  Yanina will therefore be able to adequately prepare food and have greater security and well-being, so that she can continue working and trying to achieve her great dream of having her own business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1388769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a stove.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-07-15T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-14T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yanina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":58.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":59.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":62.47},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":65.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":67.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":73.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":76.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":80.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.97,"local_amount":58.48,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":63.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776425},{"amount":23.56,"local_amount":59.96,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":65.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779381},{"amount":24.54,"local_amount":62.47,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":67.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054577},{"amount":25.85,"local_amount":65.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":71.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819474},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":67.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":73.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472418},{"amount":27.96,"local_amount":71.19,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":77.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694896},{"amount":28.93,"local_amount":73.63,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":80.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450390933},{"amount":30.14,"local_amount":76.72,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":83.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067435},{"amount":33.92,"local_amount":86.34,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":93.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542485404},{"amount":30.48,"local_amount":77.59,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":84.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579528642}],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T19:55:09Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:21:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorna Gladman","image":733132}},{"id":582600,"name":"Perlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a widowed parent of three children, Perlita works hard to support her family.

He aspires to replicate this model around the country to change the way collections are done everywhere. \n\nThe loan of $4,285 will help Ron pay for a phone, equipment, and marketing, which will bring in more customers, increase revenue, and eventually help him give more back to the community.\n\nCheck out Cash-Flow Credit Counseling & Collections below.\nhttp:\/\/cf.mandocentrik.info\/\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1378460,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2866,"youtubeId":"3jvNDC2yZQk","title":"Kiva Borrower Ronald from United States","thumbnailImageId":1378460},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To develop his communications infrastructure and give more back to the community.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"East Brunswick","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":316,"posted_date":"2013-07-15T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-14T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":4300,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4285,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":351.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":359.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":363.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":351.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":356.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":359.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":363.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":577178,"name":"Natividad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natividad came to the U.S. from Peru in 2006.

By being a teacher and daycare employee for many years, Jean has become a mother, in her own right, to every child she cares for and educates. She is well respected in her community for this very reason. Jean knows her community is in need of a daycare with extended hours for hard-working parents. \r\n\r\nOnce this need was identified, Jean knew she wanted to be the one to create the solution. The only thing stopping her from opening her own childcare center was the lack of access to capital. It is for exactly this reason that Jean requested a loan. With this loan, Jean can buy furniture for her daycare. With the presence of her daycare, more children will have caretakers when their parents are working, and will be educated by a sharp woman at the same time. In the future, she hopes to expand and employ more caretakers just as passionate as she is."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5350,"image":{"id":1385626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase furniture for her daycare center.

She has already purchased a market stall and she has a starting capital of 4000 somoni, which were sent by her husband, a migrant worker in Russia. Hamida will use this loan along with her savings to purchase watermelons and cantaloupes and start selling them. This lucrative business will help Hamida improve the financial situation of her family.

He will also install seats in his mini-bus to offer comfortable journey to his clients. \n\nTamaz\u2019s loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Savoern hopes that this loan will enable her to send her daughter to a university and also help her daughter to end up with a good job after graduating in order to help support her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1387758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To cover the school fees for her daughter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kandal province, Kandal Stoeng district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-07-15T11:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-14T11:00:05Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Savoern","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":196,"local_amount":196,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T10:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":196,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450135433},{"amount":28,"local_amount":28,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459240147},{"amount":28,"local_amount":28,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468065350},{"amount":28,"local_amount":28,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479283176},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490979675}],"funded_date":"2013-07-15T14:51:02Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T20:09:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":582659,"name":"Ngem's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A citizen from a rural village located in the Pursat Reap province\u2019s Kror Kor district, Ngem, 43, is married with eight children, two of whom are dependent on her and still in school.

Tolobek and his family have been running their own business since 1993.  A cow was purchased first.  Today, he has two dairy cows and one horse on his farm.  Tolobek's wife acitvely helps to run the business.  Thanks to Tolobek's hard work and patience, his family's monthly profit amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).  His oldest daughter works and helps the family financially.  The younger children help with the household.

school-aged or younger.  Her spouse helps her with her farm.  She began breeding cattle more than 10 years ago.  Today, thanks to her hard work and dedication, she has a small farm where she also grows crops.

He's an attentive father and focuses his efforts on providing for his family.  For more than 22 years he has worked with livestock.  He buys cattle, fattens them up over a few months and sells them at a local market where he has his own clients.  Ashurboy has planned for a few years to build a new home but he doesn't have the money.  His house isn't up to housing codes and he must immediately build a new one.  He is asking for a loan of 15,000 KGS to buy building materials like cement, wood, sand, etc.  He awaits your

Umeda wants to build a shed to store her wheat and potato crops, but she does not have enough money to buy building materials. Because it is humid in northern Tajikistan, she needs to store the crops in a dry place before selling them. She has asked for a loan of $1,000 in order to buy brick and slate.

Which means she needs to get up very early and travel a great distance to obtain good quality wood.  She also incurs expenses transporting the wood. \r\n\r\nThe loan that Mar\u00eda is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is for purchasing cedar wood, which is very good quality and assures that her furniture will also be good quality.  Once they purchase the wood, Mar\u00eda and her husband will be able to make a chest of drawers that has been ordered and thereby fill the customer's order. \r\n\r\nBy selling furniture, Mar\u00eda will be able to generate income, which will be helpful in paying back her loans and meeting her household expenses (food and public services). \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda states that she wants to always work making furniture in order to meet the household expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1387095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"with the purchase of cedar wood, which is very high quality and ensures that her furniture is also good quality.

She has provided them with an education and good manners. She now lives with only one of her daughters and three grandchildren in her own home. Doli sells clothing, sandals, high-heeled shoes, and other common accessories. All her merchandise is sent in from another city in large packages by one of her daughters. When Doli receives her orders, she selects the articles that she will later put up for sale. She goes out every day through the streets of the city looking for customers. She brings all her merchandise along to offer door-to-door. She sells for cash or on credit, and charges daily, weekly, or every five weeks. When she is unable to sell everything in the city, she travels to other population centres near the riverbank; she is able to sell everything there and will return home, approximately ten days after having left, very happy. \r\nDoli started this business two years ago. She works alone and is very satisfied with her work. She enjoys her work because it allows her to take advantage of her time and use it for other activities very comfortably. She has learned how to win the respect and confidence of her clients because of her good service and big smile. She has good sales, and thus makes a good income.

He is married to Ada and has 4 children.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife are owners of a water supply business that he says has provided water to the neighborhood since 1991. He says it all came about because in those days everyone in the neighborhood had a need to obtain access to drinking water. For this same reason, Celso decided to dig an artesian well for his own personal use. However, he says that at the time, the need that his neighbors had to access drinking water was so great that he was motivated to lend them a hand. He decided to take a risk and opened his water supply business. He began expanding his facilities to his closest neighbors. He put in a water outlet at the corner of his house where horse-drawn carts approached with drums to transport the vital liquid to the most distant regions.\r\n\r\nBy taking out a mortgage loan, Celso expanded his facilities little by little to be able to provide drinking water to more people. At the same time, his business grew and today he has 1292 users, all registered y controlled by high-quality meters. Today his water supply facility is equipped with 6 artesian wells - each with a depth of 145 meters, an underground water tank with a capacity of 106,000 liters that functions as a reserve and three 35,000-liter tanks that supply the community on a daily basis. The water supply facility is completely automated in terms of tank loading and the distribution system.\r\n\r\nCelso is a well-recognized person in the region, always characterized by the struggle he went through to further his community. There are many projects attributed to him, such as an electrical extension of more than 1700 meters of wiring, the construction of a school and improvements made to roads by paving them.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting this loan to purchase a vehicle to use in his water supply business as a means to distribute the water and to use in times of emergency at the facility. He is very grateful to receive this opportunity; it will be of great assistance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":11350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":11350,"image":{"id":1388904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water

They chose this name for their group because they hope their businesses will prosper with this loan and they can give their families a better quality of life.  This group is located in Tierra Blanca, known for its very hot summers and for commerce and ranching, its main economic activities.\n\nThe members of the group are Eunice, shoe sales; Filiberto, taxi service; Mar\u00eda Teresa, cosmetics sales; Claudia Estela, fruit and vegetable sales; Rosa, clothing sales; Guadalupe, pastry making; Gladis, costume jewelry sales; Rebeca, clothing sales; Santa, costume jewelry sales; Mar\u00eda Lorenza, perfume sales; Adela, shoe sales; Cristi\u00e1n, clothing sales; Guillermina, butcher shop; Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, clothing sales; and Reyna, clothing sales.\n\nGuadalupe, or Lupe as she's known to her friends, is 30 years old.  She only went to high school.  She's married to Jorge, a teacher.  They have two children who attend elementary school, Luis Roberto, 10, and Alex, 7.\n\nLupe says she has earned a living making pastry and baking for several years now.  She decided to start this work because she has always liked to cook and, especially, make desserts.  Her taste for this activity came from her need to make healthy food for her children.  Then she thought selling desserts and making pastry would be a good way to earn her own money.\n\nLittle by little she has attracted good customers.  She sells door-to-door and on order.  One day she goes out to offer her products and the next day she makes the pastries to deliver.  She also makes sandwiches for parties.  Lupe says she has more sales in the cold weather, but she's always looking for ways to keep her sales stable.  In the hot weather gelatin sells very well.\n\nWhat she likes most about her job in addition to earning her own money is that making pastry reflects the best of what she is, and she puts a lot of love and effort into each sandwich or pastry she makes.\n\nA loan from Kiva and VisionFund will help her buy flour, sugar, eggs, gelatin, disposable supplies, Chantilly cream, powdered sugar, and containers.\n\nIn the future she plans to study to be a chef, expand her business, set herself up in a place, and provide banquet services with her children to make her job a family business.\n\nShe's grateful for the support of VisionFund because she has been able to make progress with her business and improve her quality of life with these

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. Originally dominated by English settlers in the early 20th century, the region\u2019s farmland was redistributed after Kenya's independence. This left Trans-Nzoia one of Kenya\u2019s most cosmopolitan areas, with individuals from a variety of linguistic and ethnic groups living in close proximity. The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflowers, sugar cane, millet, and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary, extinct volcano. Its proximity to the dense Mount Elgon forest, as well as other neighboring forests, makes it a high-potential beekeeping region. \r\n\r\nSamuel is married, and has five children.
