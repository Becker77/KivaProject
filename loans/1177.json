","en":"Ashiroy is 52 years old. She is married and has four children and lives with her family in the J. Rumy region. Ashiroy and her husband do land cultivation and grow field crops. Her oldest son is married and now works abroad. His wife has recently learned to sew and now wants to apply her skills in business. Ashiroy wants to help her daughter-in-law to open her own business and that's why she came for a loan to buy an electronic sewing machine by the make of Yamata. Her daughter-in-law plans to make two dresses a day. She can sew a simple dress and a dress with beautiful embroidery which costs more. Ashiroy says that the sewing business is profitable in their region because many women and young girls buy fabrics and give them to seamstresses to make dresses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1387642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a Yamata electronic sewing machine to open a sewing business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.Rumy","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-07-16T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-15T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashiroy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":630,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":48.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":49.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":51.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":57.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.99,"local_amount":46.51,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":47.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399873288},{"amount":48.92,"local_amount":47.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":48.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410150038},{"amount":50.16,"local_amount":48.62,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419913210},{"amount":51.23,"local_amount":49.65,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":51.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561302},{"amount":52.34,"local_amount":50.73,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030200},{"amount":53.21,"local_amount":51.6,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":53.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449682836},{"amount":54.58,"local_amount":52.9,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":54.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459152554},{"amount":55.82,"local_amount":54.1,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":55.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467968737},{"amount":57.05,"local_amount":55.3,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":57.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479189041},{"amount":58.3,"local_amount":56.5,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":58.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490882439},{"amount":120.4,"local_amount":116.7,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":120.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504309511}],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T13:54:14Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":583062,"name":"Rosemarie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemarie is 39 years of age, married and has two children.

This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, an egg, etc. Gloria buys her products from a wholesaler at a lower price;  then she sells it per piece for a higher price to earn a profit. Her regular customers are her neighbours, passersby and the people in the community. She earns PHP 300 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, Gloria is requesting a PHP 23,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. This loan will be a great help for her in adding more products to her store.\r\n\r\nGloria dreams of having other sources of income and hopes that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1388392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-07-16T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-15T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":4599.99,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4761.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534954},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":7666.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":7936.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784351},{"amount":146.67,"local_amount":6133.32,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":6349.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771337},{"amount":110,"local_amount":4600.04,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4761.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824385}],"funded_date":"2013-07-16T13:09:30Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T13:12:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":583103,"name":"Filipina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of five children, Filipina works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe runs a piggery in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from a general store and selling meat.

He is very well known, being one of the most active people in his community, and makes a living running a small and very modest shop. He lives with his wife and 2 grandchildren, a girl aged 8 years and a boy of 3, and obviously adores them. He works hard for them every day and has been running the shop for 6 years, which gives them a small income. Before he had the shop he used to work on a farm but the farm closed because of poor management and so now he only has the income from the shop to live on.\r\n\r\nHe has to travel to the city to buy the majority of the products he sells in his shop. He has to travel 64 kilometres by collective transport to the city centre, which takes him an hour and a half. The products he buys are vegetables, sweets, personal hygiene items etc., and items which are delivered to him are mainly drinks and products such as detergents.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy more products for the shop. Over time the demand for his products has become greater and he has insufficient products to be able to satisfy the needs of his customers. He will also buy a shelf to display the products with which he wants to expand the shop.\r\n  \r\nBy obtaining the loan he will be able to satisfy the needs of his customers as well as having a larger clientele, which will give him a bigger income for his family and enable him to comfortably meet the family's needs.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to build bigger premises for the shop and he already has plenty of space where he lives. This is one of the dreams which he has, as the entrepreneurial businessman he has shown himself to be. He also wants to provide his grandchildren with further education when they are older because one of his dreams is to be able to see them qualify as professionals.\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1388156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more products for the shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-16T12:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-15T12:40:08Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":71.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":78.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":80.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":87.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":88.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":94.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":102.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.37,"local_amount":72.37,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":72.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814955},{"amount":73.76,"local_amount":73.76,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":73.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090790},{"amount":78.34,"local_amount":78.34,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":78.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856785},{"amount":76.83,"local_amount":76.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":76.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505063},{"amount":698.7,"local_amount":698.7,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":698.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716139}],"funded_date":"2013-08-15T12:59:36Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":583153,"name":"Heak's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Heak is a rice and corn farmer in the local area of Thmor Koul district of Battambang province.

los estudios en su universidad, pues su sue\u00f1o es ser una profesional con excelencia para poder desarrollarse como empresaria. Bel\u00e9n resid\u00eda en una ciudad que fue azotada por varias amenazas de erupci\u00f3n volc\u00e1nica y por lo cual la actividad econ\u00f3mica se redujo por la poca afluencia de turistas, es por esto que ella decidi\u00f3 migrar al Cant\u00f3n de Salcedo en donde vive actualmente y est\u00e1 ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. Los productos agr\u00edcolas m\u00e1s comercializados son granos como arveja, fr\u00e9jol, lenteja, haba y tambi\u00e9n varias frutas y verduras. La producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados abastece la distribuci\u00f3n interna y el excedente se env\u00eda a la Regi\u00f3n Costa en productos ya procesados. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nUno de los alimentos t\u00edpicos de esta ciudad son los \u201chelados de salcedo\u201d productos que guardan una gran historia y tienen m\u00e1s de 60 a\u00f1os en el mercado, su receta fue descubierta en los interiores de un convento por una de las madres franciscanas  quienes anhelaban mejores d\u00edas para la comunidad, es por esto que inicialmente este producto ten\u00eda el nombre inicial de \u201cHelado de las Monjas\u201d que era comercializado solamente en el interior del convento pero la demanda era tan alta que luego los vend\u00edan de forma ambulante generando as\u00ed trabajo para varias personas del pueblo. Finalmente varias familias tuvieron acceso a la f\u00f3rmula que ahora los hace famosos en todo el pa\u00eds e incluso internacionalmente, pues son exportados alrededor de 80.000 unidades cada a\u00f1o a varios pa\u00edses. \nBel\u00e9n nos cuenta esta historia de memoria pues trabaj\u00f3 en un sitio de venta de helados de salcedo y hace un a\u00f1o emprendi\u00f3 con su propio local de helados en donde vende tambi\u00e9n v\u00edveres y golosinas, es de gran ayuda para ella que su local est\u00e9 ubicado en un lugar estrat\u00e9gico en el centro de la ciudad en donde pasean varios turistas. Invierte 5 horas cada d\u00eda a la atenci\u00f3n de su local, pues varias horas tambi\u00e9n debe asistir a la universidad y cumplir tareas.

Aunque Bel\u00e9n no ha tenido la oportunidad de asistir a las capacitaciones que ofrece Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, ella ha encontrado en esta IMF el apoyo y asesor\u00eda necesarios para dar paso firme a su crecimiento. Ella considera muy importante el apoyo que varios microempresarios y emprendedores reciben de todo el mundo a trav\u00e9s de Kiva y se siente muy motivada para seguir y cumplir sus obligaciones pues as\u00ed no solo ella sino tambi\u00e9n su pa\u00eds presentar\u00e1n una excelente imagen ante el mundo.","en":"Bel\u00e9n is a 21-year-old young woman. She is single and works very hard in order to pay for her university studies. Bel\u00e9n's dream is to become a professional businesswoman. She lived in a city that was devastated by volcanic eruptions. As a result, the local economy has suffered from a drop in tourism. That is why Bel\u00e9n decided to move to the canton of Salcedo, where she currently lives. Salcedo is located in the Oriente de Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces in the mountain region of Ecuador. \r\n\r\nIn Salcedo, there are many tourist attractions such as lakes, hot springs, and extreme sports for adventure tourists. However, the principal economic activity in this town is agriculture and (to a smaller extent) livestock. The most abundant crops include peas, beans, lentils, and other fruits and vegetables. Milk and dairy products are also produced for local markets and the excess processed items are sent to the coastal region. This is a good region for raising livestock due to the favorable climate the canton enjoys. Despite this productivity, there are some very concerning illiteracy and poverty rates. Many basic needs are not met. For example, the sewage system only reaches 25% of homes in the area. \r\n\r\nOne of the typical foods of the city are the \"Salcedo ice creams\", products that have a great history and have been sold for over 60 years. The recipe was discovered in the convent of some Franciscan nuns who desired better days for the community. For this reason, the first name for the dessert was \"the nuns' ice cream\" and was sold only from the convent. However, demand grew so high that they began to sell the ice cream in the streets, which created jobs for the people of the town. Finally, various families learned the now famous recipe, which is recognized throughout the country and internationally. Each year, about 80,000 units are exported to various countries.\r\n\r\nBel\u00e9n knows the history by heart because she worked at a site that sells the Salcedo ice cream. A year ago, she opened her own ice cream shop from which she also sells groceries and sweets. This is a great help to her because her store is located in a strategic place in the center of the city where many tourists pass by. Bel\u00e9n works five hours each day at her store because she also attends classes and has homework from the university.\r\n\r\nBel\u00e9n is requesting a loan to do some repairs on her home, which is deteriorating and is a daily nuisance. Although Bel\u00e9n has not had the opportunity to attend the trainings that Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa offers, she enjoys the support and advice this institution provides to help her grow.

","en":"Kuljamila is a 53-year-old widow and \"Hero Mother\" who has seven children (three sons and four daughters).  Her five eldest children are married and live on their own.  In search of supplemental income for her family after the death of her husband, Kuljamila decided to start raising crops and animals.  Today she has a small farm with two dairy cows, two calves and 15 head of sheep and goats.  She also has .90 hectares of land, where she plants potatoes and beans.  With the goal of increasing her business, Kuljamila has turned to the Bai-Tushum Microfinance Bank for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy calves.  Her children help her run her farm and her family is well-respected among the villagers.  She plans on using the money from the loan to increase her head of livestock and she wants to make repairs to her home in the future.  Kuljamila is one of three people in the \"Kelechek-N\"

Kristina and was born in Sejiram, Kapuas Hulu, West Kalimantan, on July 7, 1996. She was the first child and has four brothers. Her father and her mother work as an elementary school teacher in the village. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to become an expert in shipping and transportation management. Because Indonesia is an archipelagic nation, certainly there are a lot of jobs in the field of shipping and transportation management.\r\n\r\nKristina recently graduated from high school. She wants to continue her studies at the Academy of Maritime Nusantara Cilacap, Department of KPN. Kristina chose AMN for two reasons, first because her parents cannot afford tuition for Kristina, and second, as an expert in shipping and transportation management, she will be able to quickly get a job in Indonesia or a foreign company. So Kristina can achieve her goals without  burdening her parents and can provide greater opportunities for her younger siblings to attend school.\r\n\r\nTo be able to achieve her goals, Kristina is willing to go far from her parents and younger siblings to attend school on the island of Java. Kristina chose AMN college in Cilacap, because Kristina got information from her uncle who works in YSBS that in Cilacap there is the AMN Student Loan program for students from poor families. This program gave her great hope and Kristina is very excited because then she can go to college and later can achieve her goals. Kristina said, \"But the excitement and hope is still dependent on the kindness of all of you, and depends on your generosity to lend me money for school fees. Please help me. I promise to return the loan later when I've graduated and am working. For your generosity, I say thank you. \"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1388410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay education fees for three years.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"CILACAP","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":253,"posted_date":"2013-07-16T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-15T15:00:03Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kristiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T14:46:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":583657,"name":"Gustavo Adolfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gustavo tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad, esta acompa\u00f1ado y tiene un hijo de seis a\u00f1os de edad.

Her parents are small farmers who work on farms owned by others, and their income is not enough, so they are not able to send Ratna  to college.\r\n\r\nRatna wants to continue study in college to improve the economic condition of the family. She wants to become an expert in nautical science. Because Indonesia is an archipelagic nation, certainly there are a lot of jobs in the field of nautical science, both for domestic shipping and international shipping. Ratna dreams of becoming a ship captain so she can sail around the world.\r\n\r\nRatna wants to continue her study at the Academy of Maritime Nusantara Cilacap, Department of Nautical science.

She has a high school education and has been growing crops and raising farm animals since 1997, when she started a business with 5,000 somoni. Despite the loss of her husband, who was the family's breadwinner, Atyrkul found the strength in herself to keep the farm going. Today she is a successful farmer with three milk cows, one horse, and 20 head of sheep and goats. She also has 1.2 hectares of land to grow potatoes and beans. She earns 10,000 somoni per month and her children help out around the farm. The family is friendly and well-respected in the village. In order to continue developing her business, Atyrkul asked Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 somoni to buy cattle and increase her herds.

In this way, she will be able to increase sales and, in turn, earnings, to continue supporting her children and give them the opportunity to have a good education to improve their quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1389103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":["Job Creation"],"use":"to pay for a training course in waiting and bar service.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-07-16T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-15T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Miriam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":173356,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":56529},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":57776},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":59051}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.01,"local_amount":57225,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":62719.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390982359},{"amount":33.26,"local_amount":57653,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":63188.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822187},{"amount":33.73,"local_amount":58478,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":64092.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440010143}],"funded_date":"2013-07-16T18:17:53Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":583233,"name":"Sahista","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sahista, age 22, is a married woman.

","en":"Sanobar is 49 years old.  She is married and raising three children.  She had been dreaming of becoming a teacher since childhood.  Her family was big and not financially well-off, and this is why she did not have an opportunity to go to a university and get a higher education.  She got married and had children.  She got accepted to a university several years later.  At that time, she already had two children.  She completed the university studies with difficulty and a lot of effort and now works as a teacher at her district's secondary school.  She lives with her husband and three children with her husband's parents.  The children grew up and need a separate house.  The family purchased a land plot this year, but does not have money to buy construction materials, such as cement, bricks, sand, etc.  Sanobar is requesting a loan in the amount of 4000 somoni.  She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1387718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She intends to use this loan amount to buy more spools of threads in different colors and packs of laces, zippers and buttons.  This will help her to create more clothes as a means of increasing revenues so she may able to generate a healthier source of income.  Sharifa is in her 4th loan cycle and is thankful to Kashf for its tremendous support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1388422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy

","en":"Holida is 30 years old.  She is not married and lives with her parents.  Holida had been dreaming of becoming a hairstylist and opening her own beauty salon since a young age.  She learned all of the nuances of the trade from a hairstylist after finishing a secondary school.  Holida leased a space and started her business.  It was difficult at first, but thanks to her hard work, she overcame all of the difficulties.  Holida has been involved in this business for over 8 years.  She wants to develop her business further.  She is requesting a loan in the amount of 3100 somoni to purchase equipment for the beauty salon and to pay for the space lease.

The most celebrated party is community day, also called \"The Lord of the Miracles\", and is held September 14\r\n\r\nLety, as she is affectionately called, is a member of the group and is a very devoted to her family, but also very hardworking. She was only able to study until high school. She is 30-years-old and is married to Alberto who works as a mason. They have been married for 12 years and have formed a family with five children, four of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nLety has had a grocery store and a mill to grind the boiled corn (maize to make tortillas) for two years. Lety says, \"My motivation for starting my business was because where we live there was not a store or a mill close by. To find these services me and my neighbors had to walk several kilometers.\" \r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting a loan to buy more grocery products like salt, sugar, bread, eggs, milk, soft drinks, canned goods etc. Her business is doing very well because as there is not another store that creates competition and for this reason her earnings are very good. However, she is worried because she does not have a refrigerator where she can keep her dairy products. When it comes to buying sometimes she cannot sell fast enough before the goods expire. For Lety these are lost profits and investments.  Either way this situation does not stop Lety who wants to have a c a stationery store because there is also not a stationery store near where she lives. The children have to walk several minutes to get materials for their classes. Lety describes, \"I am very happy and grateful for VisionFund and Kiva for all the support received through the credits because I could maintain my two businesses. My earnings are going very well which helps me improve the quality of life for my children. It is very important to me that they finish a professional degree.\" \r\n\r\nThe other group members are also very grateful for the loan provided because they can invest in their businesses--Alejandra in chickens and sheep, Victoria fruits and vegetables, Julia and Laura bought lambs for breeding, growing and selling, Carmen in a grocery store, and Alberto income in handiwork (wood for building).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":1388732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase milk, bread, eggs, soft drinks, and canned goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dotegiare, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-07-17T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-16T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberto Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":706.25,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":9038.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944859},{"amount":706.25,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9038.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227933},{"amount":706.25,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9038.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991778},{"amount":706.25,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":9038.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644432}],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T21:14:39Z","paid_date":"2013-12-18T00:14:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alana Abbitt-McGregor","image":1119620}},{"id":583308,"name":"Mahasen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mahasen is a 33-year-old mother of two children.

She has been a working for 26 years as a baker. A trade she learned one day when her lady friend was baking and invited her to work with her in making bread. That's how she learned slowly until one day decided to open her own bakery.\r\n\r\nShe travels by bus to the city, about seven miles from home, in order to buy all the supplies you need to make bread.\r\n\r\nThe loan is asking from Field Foundation, is to buy flour, eggs, yeast, sugar, butter, trays to place the bread, and other materials. Currently what she is working with is almost useless. With the investment, she will buy utensils used in the bakery.

He is a Palestinian refugee, living in a Palestinian camp in the South of Lebanon. Palestinians in Lebanon are a marginalized segment of the population since they are restricted to a specific range of low-income jobs, and are often discriminated against. Furthermore, because of the dire situation of Palestinians in Lebanon, Jaber did not receive an education when he was a child, which is why he is illiterate, a great handicap in his life. However, trying to overcome these difficulties, Jaber became a fisherman. Later on he discovered that his revenue did not suffice to provide for a family of six members, which is why he also decided to work in the field of selling furniture.

Desde hace 5 a\u00f1os se dedica a la reparaci\u00f3n de motos y bicicletas; ya que nunca tubo la ayuda de su padre y a sido su madre quien se encargo de criarlo toda la vida.   El  oficio lo aprendi\u00f3 de manera emp\u00edrica, ya que cerca de donde el viv\u00eda, estaba ubicado un peque\u00f1o taller, y todas las tardes llegaba a observar como era que realizaban las labores de trabajo. De esta manera al ver la insistencia  que el muchacho tenia, cierto d\u00eda le dieron la oportunidad de dejarlo laborar en el taller. as\u00ed  fue como aprendi\u00f3 y hace dos a\u00f1os coloco su propio taller, donde actualmente labora.  Con los pocos ingresos que obtiene compra los materiales en la ciudad, en una tienda reconocida en ventas al por mayor de repuestos y herramientas.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar llantas de bicicletas y de moto, porque no tiene disponible para sus clientes solo las repara peor no teine a la venta para cambiarlas,  rines, quiere vender chasis de bicicletas de esto no vende en este momento.

He never had the help of his father, and it was his mother who raised him all his life. He learned the trade empirically, as near where he lived there was a small workshop, and every afternoon he went to watch how the work was done. Seeing the boy's persistence, one day they gave him the opportunity to work in the shop. This is how he learned, and two years ago he started his own workshop, where he now works. With the little income he earns, he buys materials in the city, at a shop known for wholesale parts and tools. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to purchase bicycle and motorcycle tires, because he does not have them available for his clients; he repairs them but does not have them for sale to be able to change them. He will also buy rims. He would like to sell bicycle frames, which he does not sell at the moment. This way, he will improve and equip his small business. What he wants is to be able to provide better service to his customers. \r\n\r\nOnce his business conditions improve he will invest in the purchase of better quality replacement parts. David hopes to attract many more clients through those he currently has, and thus generate more income, with which he hopes to provide a better quality of life for his children. \r\n\r\nDavid's plan is first to pay off the loan and continue to have the opportunity for new loans with the institution. Another is to give his children the chance to get a university degree, since he never had that chance, due to the lack of assistance from his father. He would also like to see his business grow.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1390109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle

Painting has always been her passion, which is why she would like to enhance her business. Her husband is a guard at the customs, and one of her children is enrolled in a private school. This means that their combined revenue is not sufficient to provide a healthy life for their household, especially since they have to cover the schooling tuition fees. \r\n\r\nNagham decided to establish the group because she would like to purchase drawing materials for her students, increasing their number, and to prepare for the exhibition she is working on.\r\n\r\nAs for the other group
