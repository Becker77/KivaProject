The women chose this name because they love flowers, which grow in abundance in many parts of Guatemala. The population of this area works in agriculture and grows corn, beans, vegetables, and coffee. They also produce handicrafts, like candles and woven cotton items.\r\n\r\nMaria Calixta, a 24-year-old, single mother of a four-year-old boy, is a member of the Trust Bank. She understands that it is never too late to seek personal and professional improvement. Because her son has not begun his own education, Maria Calixta is enrolled in her very first year of school which she attends over the weekends. She is most excited about what she is learning and has the motivation to learn as much as possible, especially learning to read and write in Spanish. She is doing this, so that she can be well-prepared to help her own son when he begins his education. She is hopeful for a better future for his generation.\r\n\r\nLike many in her village, Maria Calixta works in the production of handicrafts, producing napkins, placemats, tablerunners, and caps, which she sells in Santo Domingo Xenacoj and in neighboring markets.

She focuses on wedding, graduation and family photos.\r\n \r\nAlbertina\u2019s disposable income is now invested in start-up fees for her seven-month-old enterprise. As she looked to grow, she found herself in need of an equipment upgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about non-profit microlender Accion Texas Inc. from an active Accion client, she inquired about a loan and was approved for $5,450. The loan helps Albertina offer more services and, therefore, the ability to secure more photography contracts.\r\n\r\nWithout the loan, Albertina says she would have had to continue working with the equipment she currently owns, limiting the amount of possible work and business income. \r\n\r\nThe 40-year-old entrepreneur is also the sole proprietor, but she hopes to hire two part-time employees in the near future. For now, her plans are to expand her offerings and increase her clientele.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1388807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to update her photography equipment and offer more services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"New Iberia, Louisiana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-07-17T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-16T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":176.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":225.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":583518,"name":"Lashanda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"LaShanda is a former event planner for an Atlanta, Georgia, radio station where she coordinated major events such as festivals, concerts and fundraisers.

She receives additional income from a bit of livestock, she owns one dairy cow, and one calf.  Her husband and children actively help her with the business.  Thanks to her hard work and optimism, Gulmira has a monthly income from her business of around 8,000 KGS.  Her profits have allowed her to increase her turn over and, in turn, improve her family's well-being.  With the goal of further developing her business, Gulmira has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy food goods to resale.

She has a degree and works in a rural school as a teacher of primary classes.  In the year 2000, she was searching for a source of additional income for her family and began working with livestock.  She started this business with 20,000 KGS.  Thanks to her tireless efforts as well as the help and support of her husband, she has seen good results from her business.  Her monthly income is around 5,000 KGS.  Today, she has in her care two dairy cows, two calves and one horse.  Her profits have allowed Syinat to breed her livestock thus improving her family's well-being.  With the goal of further increasing her herd, Syinat has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy cows.  She plans on reinvesting the income from the loan to procure more animals.  In the future, she also wants to give her children a worthy education.

","en":"Ehson is a very energetic and fun guy.  He doesn't like to sit on his hands and always finds something to be doing.  He is not married but he hopes to be lucky this year and find himself a suitable candidate to wed.  He works at one organization, but his pay there isn't enough.  So he and his father rent land where they grow various crops.  Ehson loves and cherishes his parents, and tries to do for them all so they don't want for anything.  Ehson's mother has wanted to make repairs to their home for some time but she's been unable to.  Ehson wants to help his parents make the repairs on their home since they are no longer young and don't have the strength for such a task any longer.  He wants to take responsibility for the project and feels that children should always help their parents.  Ehson has some savings, but not enough.  For this reason, he has turned to Arvand for a loan.  Ehson will use the funds to buy building materials.  He very much wants to make his mother's dream come true and relies on Arvand's support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1379870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGenalyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 50,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nGenalyn hopes that her variety store will grow to be a grocery store.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She is from the Chinandega zone in the western part of the country. \r\n\r\nIrania is a hard-working woman and a fighter. This has allowed her to get ahead in life. She is the owner of a small convenience store run out of her home that sells household consumer goods, including rice, sugar, beans, oil, bread, bizcotelas (a type of cookie), cosmetic products such as shampoo, body lotion and soap, as well as frozen products, sweets and other items. Irania has both casual and repeat customers that always look for her because of the great service she offers them from the moment she opens the doors at 6 AM, until 10:30 PM when she closes. If they seek her out after that time due to an emergency it is her pleasure to help them. She started her business with her own funds she saved from her previous job. In addition to her business she sells food on weekends, which allows her to have an additional source of income. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this loan is to reinforce her working capital, further invest in her business so it continues to grow and to remodel the convenience store area in the not-too-distant future.

They have known each other for a number of years and during this time they have built up a close and sincere friendship.  They live in a Mazahua community where some people still communicate in their native language.  Nowadays very few women still wear the typical local dress which is characterised by very bright colours.  Something very characteristic of the community where the group is based is its very green pasture land and the beautiful scenery of wooded hills.  \r\n\r\nAdriana, who is 26, is one member of the group.  She was only educated to secondary level and is known for being very cheerful and always in a good mood.  She lives with Angel, who works as a bricklayer, and together they have built a family of five children, two of who are still in education.  Adriana has had a grocery shop for 4 years now.  She is seeking a loan to buy more groceries such as bread, eggs, milk, soft drinks, tinned goods etc.  Adriana says that she set up the grocery shop because where she lives there was no shop to buy anything.  She says that the loan has enabled her to keep her grocery shop going; she always tries to stock a bit of everything so as to keep her customers happy.  Her shop is doing very well and she makes good profits as she makes sales every day.  Her only problem is the fact that she has no fridge because her previous one broke down, meaning that she will not be able to sell soft drinks or dairy products for a while.  She will now have to save up to pay for the fridge to be repaired.  Adriana hopes that her profits will not fall because her one ambition in life is to manage to get a bigger shop and turn it into a general store.\r\n\r\nAdriana says: \"I also want to help my children study for a professional career to improve their quality of life\".\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are grateful because the loan will be useful for their economic activities and will perhaps help them increase their profits and extend their businesses.  Irma and Mar\u00eda Elsa will invest in their grocery shops; Zenaida and Irene will invest in chickens; and Carmen will invest in sheep.

To provide the primary source of income for her family, Gulbubu has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for ten years, having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work and patience, today her business contains two dairy cows and six sheep, and the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS).   In order to further develop her business and increase livestock headcount, Gulbubu requested a loan in the amount of 25,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy small livestock.

To-date, thanks to her persistence and drive, and help from her family, she was able to develop a small business, containing four cows and two horses.  Altyngul wants to continue increasing the livestock headcount and, for this purpose, requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cattle.
