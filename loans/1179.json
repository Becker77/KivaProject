Nasipkan has been involved in breeding livestock for 18 years and is concurrently involved in farming.  Nasipkan has not only practical experience, but also theoretical know-how in breeding livestock.  She treats her business with a lot of responsibility.  She annually works on 0.45 hectares of land and grows corn.  The children help with the business.  Her husband works in Russia.  To-date, thanks to her persistence and drive, Nasipkan developed a small business, containing five sheep, one dairy cow, one calf and six goats.  Nasipkan wants to continue increasing the livestock headcount and, for this purpose, requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cattle.  Nasipkan is part of the \"MOL\" group that has two more participants besides her.  Nasipkan plans to use the earnings from the loan to improve the conditions for keeping livestock.

Her husband and children help with the business.  She got involved in breeding livestock over 20 years ago, having started with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  To-date, thanks to her persistence and drive, she developed a small business, containing five sheep, two dairy cows, one calf and one horse.  Bazarkan wants to continue increasing the livestock headcount and, for this purpose, requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cattle.  Bazarkan is part of the \"MOL\" group that has two more participants besides her.

She lives in the small village of Dusheti district with her 17-year-old daughter, who goes to school. Nana requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNana works as tailor. She gets orders and sews bed-clothing from home. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \r\n\r\nNana requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Nana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Nana will purchase a stock of patterns. After the stock is purchased, she will be able to offer her clients wide assortments of bed-clothing, which will increase her sales and thus the income of her family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

That\u2019s why he is putting so much effort into developing his business to provide for his family's needs. \r\nHe hopes that in the future he will be capable of buying a special car paint oven, which makes painting cars easier and more professional by decreasing time and increasing quality produced.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1389935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy used cars in order to maintain and sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Saida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.563056 35.368889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-07-18T19:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-17T19:20:01Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bilal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":113}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"A Mushegian","image":null}},{"id":584703,"name":"Celina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Celina tiene 52 a\u00f1os, es viuda y vive en su casa propia donde sus hijos independientes le visitan.

Peliks\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as he didn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nPeliks received this credit in the framework of  a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so-called Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. The loan of 700 USD will help Peliks to purchase starting inventory of fruit and vegetables. He will transport the products twice a month from the neighboring town and renew the assortment from local distributors as well.  \r\n\r\nPeliks thinks that the business will be profitable, as the market where his stall is situated has a great location and is crowded with people. After the business is started, the family will have a stable income to access regular credit products available in the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n\r\nPeliks is very enthusiastic and is a hard-working person with a great desire to ensure his children get a good education for progressing in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1389946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start up selling fruit and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Senaki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-18T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-17T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peliks","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.62},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.78,"local_amount":48.78,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:04:24Z","rounded_local_amount":48.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857574},{"amount":51.79,"local_amount":51.79,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134223},{"amount":53.62,"local_amount":53.62,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":53.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107806},{"amount":54.51,"local_amount":54.51,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":54.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255342},{"amount":491.3,"local_amount":491.3,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:19Z","rounded_local_amount":491.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019475}],"funded_date":"2013-07-20T19:47:51Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":583962,"name":"Azuberi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Azuberi is a married mother, She lives in a rental house that has electricity and piped water.

In the region, there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living. So she decided to start a business trading used clothing with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from borrowers. Maia\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. She has received credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the \u201cStartup Program,\u201d which gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of $1500, she will purchase used clothing and renovate a space where she is going to open a used clothing shop. She plans to sell a wide assortment of well-priced clothing for men, women and children. It is obvious that the job is hard for Maia, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and gradually develop her trading business. The Start Up credit will be a great support for her, as her income will be significantly increased because of Kiva Lenders.

","en":"Ranjigul is a hard-working and conscientious woman. She is single and lives with her parents.

","en":"Ibrohim is a cheerful and open-hearted person.  He tries to get the most amount of good from every situation.  He is married but doesn't have any children.  Ibrohim studied from a baker how to make flatbread.  He knows all the ins and outs of his profession and is a very experienced baker.  He bakes from his own home where he has the national oven, the tandoor.  He sells his good at a local market where he has his own clients.  This has been his profession for more than six years.  His business is the sole source of income since his wife is a homemaker.  This year he bought a plot of land with money he'd saved for a few years.  Now he wants to start construction on a home but he doesn't have the funds.  He is asking for a loan of 3,000 KGS to buy building materials like cement, wood, sand, etc. to begin.  He awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1388572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

","en":"Ahmadbek lives in Vahdat, Tajikistan.  He is 36 years old, married and lives with his parents.  He does not have any children yet.  For three years he has worked as a taxi driver.  He takes passengers between Vahdat and Dushanbe.  He makes the trip six times each day.  Ahmadbek earns a good living and the responsibility of paying for his family's expenses falls on him.  At the moment, he needs to make repairs to both his car and his home.  He has little money currently so he's taking out a loan.

He is married and has five children.  All his kids are already grown and they have their own families.  Abdukodir lives with his wife in a small home in a rural village.  Despite his age, he is full of energy and the desire to work to support his family.  He is a farmer and works with livestock.  He has a plot of land which is about 12 hectares.  Of that, about eight hectares are rain fed and the rest is irrigated.  On this land, he grows carrots, potatoes and grains.  His wife helps him care for and raise the animals.  Since they have a lot of land, he also has his cattle graze on it.  Because the livestock business brings in a good income, Abdukodir wants to expand it and increase his herd.  For this, he turned to Arvand for a loan to buy cattle.

Qasim is 34 years old, and is a married father of three children. He is a butcher and has a meat shop in his city. Qasim has ten years of experience with the business which generates the main income for his family.\r\n\r\nTo improve the services he can offer to his customers and improve the butchers shop, he would like to buy a small generator and a meat grinder machine.

She describes herself as an honest woman. \r\n<p>\r\nFor the past four years Menuna has sold fish in the local market. She started this business with money given to her by her fianc\u00e9. Most of the time she uses a share-taxi to get her goods to her table in the market. She works nine hours a day and enjoys her work because she has lots of customers and makes a good profit. \r\n<p>\r\nMenuna is applying for a 25,000 LRD loan to buy additional fish to sell.

There is a vacancy for drivers, but owning a car is a necessary condition for this position. \r\n<p>\r\nMirian applied for a 2300 USD loan through Credo.

This means he will have an additional position in the company and double the salary. It is obvious that this will be hard for Mirian, but he is ready to deal with the difficulties as he\u2019s a very enthusiastic and hardworking person with a great desire to get ahead. \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be a great help for the family.

She is a mother and, as a job, she makes and sells refreshments.  She gets up very early every day to prepare food for sale.  She always takes advantage of mornings to sell breakfast.  She tells us that the business has been very profitable in spite of the difficulties she has had with the climate because it is in the early morning that they sell their food.  This has not, however, stopped her from striving in her business. It is the second time that they have applied for a loan.  She is happy because she made her repayments for her first loan punctually, is thankful to God for not letting her get into arrears and prays that he will help her to pay punctually this time, too.

This is 39-year-old Sithembile from Mutare. She is a single parent with three children, and two are attending school.  \r\n\r\nSithembile runs a retail business, selling electrical goods (televisions, stoves and fridges) and clothes. The business has been in operation for four years.

Patima\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times since she didn't satisfy their requirements. She received her loan in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so-called Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of $3,000, Patima will open a household goods shop. She will rent a commercial space and stock of goods. Avtandil will work with her in the shop.

She plans to achieve monthly profits of 155,000 FCFA which will be used to contribute towards family expenses, pay interest on the loan and invest the rest in her activity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1390830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buy clothing and handbags","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-07-19T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-18T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":66916.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924365},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":66916.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207555},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66916.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972230},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":66916.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972231},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":66916.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624807},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":66916.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850815}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T09:10:40Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":584045,"name":"Dusu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dusu is 40 years old and lives in Sanniquille, the capital city of Nimba County, which is rich in natural resources and has living conditions that are much better than the capital city of Liberia.

Her challenge in work is that her breeding facilities still are small so that she can\u2019t raise any more pigs. Her dream is to build larger and cleaner breeding facilities. This loan is one of the steps that will help her reach her dream. Dung is a hardworking woman and a passionate businessman.\r\n\r\nShe has participated in SEDA\u2019s microfinance program since 2010. In the last loan cycle, she borrowed 8,736,000 VND and repaid on time. In this loan cycle, she would like to borrow 9,632,000 VND to buy more pigs to breed. She will use the profit to build a new farm and invest in her children\u2019s

She can invest in her farm to gain more earnings and save the profit for her children\u2019s marriage. Xuyen is a hardworking woman and a passionate businesswoman.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time she is participating in SEDA's microfinance program.

He lives with his family in a small village. But the house he lives in is too small and not very comfortable to live in. Vali's wife is a homemaker; she is a very hardworking and caring mother. Vali himself works as a waiter in a local restaurant. He has worked there for eight years and earns a decent salary. It is enough for Vali to get by, but that's all. But Vali dreams of building a large house for his family. He doesn't have the money for this; his salary isn't large enough to allow him to build a new house. So he has come to Arvand for a loan to buy building materials for the new house. He is hoping for a successful outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for its

This will be her third loan.\r\n\r\nIn future, she wants to be a vegetable wholesaler in her locality.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Fula, Dalimba, Rebati and Sebati.

The high plains lack protein, especially during low-water levels (June through November). Supplementing soy hull as a protein source for the livestock is critical at this time.

She did not go to school, and she has lived all her life in this rural area. She is unmarried, and she has four children between 15 and 26, she says. Only two of her children are in school. She was first able to establish her business selling her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s farm products. Since 2004, she has been running a table where she sells slippers in the local market. She spends nine hours on her business. One of the problems she faces is that there are few goods on her table. She is applying for a loan to buy more inventory (slippers) for her business.

Their old wooden house in the past years hasn't received any renovation and its wooden components all decayed and became beyond any repair. He has already built the house foundation but due to lack of finances, he hasn't begun other building work. So he is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass, vacuum-insulated windows, hardwood floors, shingles, foam and a iron door. \r\n\r\nUsing his purchased materials, he, together with his son and son-in-law, can build a high quality new house. The Important thing about building a new house is that it will allow the family to live in a more spacious and comfortable place where they will burn less coal for heating and release fewer pollutants into the air thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.  The borrower is a very hardworking individual who wants to see his grandchildren  living happily."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":1389405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Last year he began rendering taxi service to local people and is quite experienced at picking up customers, driving them quickly and shortening roads. Before the taxi business, he had worked at a petroleum importing company and due to hazardous work conditions he quit his job. Using his previous loan, he has finished building his house and now again he is requesting a loan in order to purchase a low pressure heater which is priced at 2,000,000 MNT. He thinks purchasing a heater will further reduce his coal consumption, which will greatly contribute to the efforts against air pollution as less coal burned means fewer pollutants released into the atmosphere. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who wants a comfortable and warm home before becoming a father.

Gulnar is a homemaker. Her eldest son is disabled and she takes care of him. Despite the fact that her son is disabled, Gulnar does not sit idly by. In search of income for her family, she began breeding cattle and cultivating the land, with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThrough her backbreaking labor and patient nature, today she has a very good homestead: two dairy cows, 20 sheep, and two calves. She also has 3.0 hectares of irrigated land, on which annually she plants clover and beans. \r\n\r\nProfits allowed Gulnar to propagate livestock on her homestead and thus to improve the family's well-being. In order to further develop her business, Gulnar turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 20,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nGulnar plans to invest income from the loan to further increase the number of livestock, and is planning to put on a wedding for her younger son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1389890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chymgent village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-07-19T15:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-18T15:40:17Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10389.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426941},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10389.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053210}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T16:28:36Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":584251,"name":"Juvy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juvy is from Cabgan, Tambulig, Zamboanga del Sur.

The roofing and installing windows and door as well as interior decoration remain due to lack of finances. \r\n\r\nAccording to his own calculations, building a new house on his old home's foundation has several advantages: in winter time, the old house was losing all its heat through walls and windows and more space will be needed in the near future as he gets married and becomes a father. So he is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase vacuum insulated windows, hardwood floors, fiberglass, shingles and foam for house building. The high quality new house will reduce the family's coal consumption greatly as Mongolians usually use coal for heating. Burning less coal will contribute to the efforts against air pollution as it will release less pollutant into the atmosphere.

By profession, she is a seamstress. From 1989 to 2012, she worked as a social worker in a social fund. \r\n\r\nSince 1990, she has been involved in agriculture--raising livestock and farming--starting this business with a sum of 12,000 som (KGS). Monthly income from the loan is 10,000 som (KGS). Through hard work, Ainagul today has a good homestead: three dairy cows, ten sheep, and one horse. She also has available 4.48 hectares of irrigated land, on which annually she plants clover and beans.

He purchases milk from the dairy farm and sells it in the local market. Currently he is in need of purchasing more milk from the farm to continue his business, but due to financial constrains he finds it difficult. For that reason, he has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan.

His business is the butchering and sale of meat. He has been involved in this business for many years and from it he gets a good wage.

The family lives together in their own home.  Nehemias has been a farmer since he was 21.  He learned to farm at a young age, because he needed to cover the family's expenses.  This is how he started to produce coffee, bananas, and corn. \r\n\r\nNehemias is very hardworking, and thanks to his arduous work he managed to acquire 10 fields to cultivate, but he is only using 6 of these.  He has a lot of plans in mind, for example, continuing to cultivate new products such as cassava and citrus fruits, as well as increasing his coffee crops.  \r\n\r\nHe is now working to clear his fields; he must undertake this activity every 3 months.  This will be his second loan with Kiva, and he feels grateful for the support that he is receiving that is enabling him to continue forward.  Also, he promises to make his payments on time.  \r\n\r\nNehemias will invest this loan in the purchase of organic fertilizer to nourish his crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1391786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to

He is married and has four children. She has a very friendly family. They live in a rural area. \r\n\r\nIn order to have income for the family, all family members are trying to make money somehow. Everyone is working as he is able. Usmon himself works as a taxi driver, and he has his own car for this work. From this work, he receives a good income. But Usmon also receives additional income from group farming. In his own small garden, he grows grapes. Though this is a seasonal business, it brings him income. \r\n\r\nThe main and stable business for Usman is raising livestock. He raises and sells cattle. He is helped in this work by his wife. She takes care of the cattle and sells their milk. The cattle business brings Usmon a good and stable income. He therefore wishes to expand the business.

She herself is a tailor, and she wants to generate more income by purchasing a new sewing machine. She will extend her business if she gets a good amount of profit in the future. Shameem has requested a loan from KIVA partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a sewing machine to sew more dresses and to satisfy the needs of her clients more professionally.

In the evenings, after she closes her fruit and vegetable stand, she prepares and sells snacks such as samosas and bagia bites (smaller versions of traditional Tanzanian fried chickpea buns). She is in her mid-forties. She and her husband have five school-going children.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mwanahamis's seventh loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.  She used her previous loans to replenish out-of-stock items in her fruits and vegetables business. She also used her loan funds to start selling her samosas and bagia bites, allowing her to increase her profit. She used her profits to help her husband to support the household and pay for their children's school fees.
