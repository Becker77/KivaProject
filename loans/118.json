He is 30 years old, married, and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, Jesus owns and operates a motorcycle transportation business.  The main source of income for the business comes from operating motorcycle transport services.  Jesus has been engaged in his business for over one year, and earns approximately 5000 PHP (Philippine pesos) a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Jesus joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation, and his ability to engage in business activities.  Jesus is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase an additional vehicle for the business.  This loan will be the first loan for Jesus from GDMPC.  He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

La unidad movil es manejada por un chofer y eventualmente por su hijo. Debido al execesivo uso y a que los caminos que conectan Cayalt\u00ed con sus anexos son bastante accidentados, la mototaxi ha empezado a sufrir algunas fallas que requieren de urgente reparaci\u00f3n, por lo que Sof\u00eda se encuentra solicitando por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles.\n\nSu mayor anhelo es brindarle a su hijo una educaci\u00f3n de calidad que le asegure un futuro exitoso.

She tells us that the initiative to start this business was born out of the need to support her family, since her husband's job as an agricultural worker does not seem to be enough to support their household costs.\r\n\r\nThe services Sof\u00eda offers are in her district's urban area and outskirts.  Her only mototaxi is driven by a driver and eventually her son.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a resident of GMA, Cavite City, Philippines. She manages her household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMaria Joey operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials such as metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials. They sell to junk shops like Maria Joey's for a small profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 700 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nMaria Joey is requesting a loan for11, 000 PHP, which she will use to augment her current revolving fund to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMaria Joey hopes her business grows more in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":940364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Celia's husband works as a security guard in a private home to help her with household expenses.  She works in agriculture and goes four days a week to sell in the market in the capital city of Managua.  She started her business by selling what she herself grows but only when she produces products to harvest.  After a while she decided to buy fruits and vegetables and with her own effort, and that of her husband, has managed to somewhat establish her business.  With the help of Afodenic, that has supported her with four loans, Celia feels happy as she can sell her products at a better price because the supplies that she buys with each loan help to nourish her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":231245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer and insecticides for crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-12-04T02:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":7.06,"local_amount":135.97,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":139.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893558},{"amount":3.07,"local_amount":59.06,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":60.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816660},{"amount":0.54,"local_amount":10.31,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351348},{"amount":1.42,"local_amount":27.44,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":28.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038681},{"amount":2.1,"local_amount":40.55,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":41.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928980},{"amount":0.62,"local_amount":11.92,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":12.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384421},{"amount":0.1,"local_amount":1.83,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890990},{"amount":1.12,"local_amount":21.6,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":22.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63112412},{"amount":658.97,"local_amount":12691.32,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":13047.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86965426}],"funded_date":"2008-12-15T03:31:35Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T10:01:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugh Yarbrough","image":1152842}},{"id":80738,"name":"Ninh Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb V\u0169 Th\u1ecb Ninh n\u0103m nay 34 tu\u1ed5i, hai v\u1ee3 ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng 3 con nh\u1ecf t\u1ea1i huy\u1ec7n Qu\u1ea3ng X\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1ec9nh Thanh H\u00f3a.

She has an eight-year-old daughter named Dina.  The two of them live in a rented house located in an area far from the central forests of Peru.  Her main goal is to provide her daughter with a brighter future.  In order to provide her with a decent quality of life, Magdalena works a thousand different jobs and is never tired because she does it all with love.  For the past four years, she has had a grocery supply business, which she operates out of her house.  At night, she works at a gas station several blocks from her house.  On the weekends, she goes to the town where she has several plots of land rented and where, for the past year, she has planted citric fruits and bananas.  What she loves most about her work is that in the end, she and her daughter are able to live comfortably.  For her, this is the best compensation.  In the future, she would like to purchase more cultivable land and a plot, where she could build her own house and also expand her business.  This is her first time seeking a loan from MFP and she is certain that she will make punctual payments.  She appreciates the faith that the institution has in her.  In addition, she is satisfied with how her communal bank is developing because she knows that the people that are forming a part of it are responsible.

She is 55 years-old and married to Alejandro V..  They are blessed with four children some are adults and others still school age. To make a living, she is presently engaged in operating a sari-sari store and a coconut, charcoal and firewood buying and selling business. Her husband is her assistant in this business. They\u2019re been engaged in these businesses for 20 years already. They earn an average amount of not less than P5,000.00 a month from these businesses. \r\n\r\nOn November 25, 2009 Adelina joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Adelina, as an active member of Paglaum MPC under the PDP-LP, a microfinance program that reaches out to rural communities, has successfully repaid a loan amount of Php7,000.00. She is now requesting a loan of Php6,000.00 as her third loan availment which will be used to provide  additional capital for her businesses.  The additional future income will be used to meet their basic needs, to make loan repayments and to pay for the children\u2019s education. She also joined PAGLAUM MPC because of the savings and insurance program offered by PAGLAUM MPC to its members. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

buying & selling ready-to-wear clothing and farming (sugarcane plantation) businesses. She lives in 111, Brgy. Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her buying & selling of ready-to-wear clothes and farming (sugarcane plantation) businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 14,700. Eva is now borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she can continue to purchase more clothes to sell.  This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Eva aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 40,000. Helen is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Helen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The family lives together in their own home, located in the town of Ricrican. \r\n\r\n\"I feel fortunate to be able to continue with my goals at a steady pace,\" she says happily.  Primitiva's main occupation is the purchase and sale of small animals such as pigs, chickens, sheep and guinea pigs.  She fattens them so she can later resell them in the central market in the town of Tarma. \r\n\r\nHowever, a year ago she bought a car with which she provides public transport, covering the routes from Palcamayo to Tarma.  Primitiva has been very successful in this business, because as she mentions, there is little access to the remote villages in the area.  It is from these remote villages that the majority of people need to get to town to buy food and groceries, to negotiate regarding their crops, and to do other types of independent work.  Therefore, she recently completed the purchase of a further vehicle, with which she is now earning additional profits, but she is continuing to save money as she has run out of working capital for new acquisition. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Mirando a un Futuro Mejor\", (\"Looking for a Better Future\"), and this is her third loan through MFP, where she feels happy to be able to share her success with the other members.

She rents a room which she shares with her sister.  Every weekend she travels from Juliaca to the city of Moquegua to sell her crafts at the Sunday market.  This trip is both very difficult and tiring but she knows she must make it to sell her products; she also enjoys offering her prized merchandise to passers-by.  She has been in this business for 12 years: it is very profitable as she is the only one selling pots, plates and other clay kitchen utensils.  She does not only sell in Moquegua as from Monday to Friday, she also sells at the markets of Juliaca.  Elba is very hard-working and wants to have her own craft store, which is why she works so very hard without rest.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 was used to fund the operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing PHP 14,000 for her current loan which she intends to use to invest in her general store. Pacita is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

For this reason, Bauzhar is applying for a loan of 100,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity. She plans to purchase more goods to resell at the local market.

Pag-asa, Barangay Port Barton, San Vicente, Palawan. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a farming business. Her husband, Leartes R., is 62 years old. He works as a street worker to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are between 13 and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nLeonisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Leonisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use towards the purchase of more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nLeonisa R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She says that it was not easy at the beginning because her customers were used to buying household items from her.  However, after using the shoes that she sold, they noticed that they were of good quality.  She currently buys a variety of shoes in the city and sells them to her acquaintances at higher prices on credit.  The business is very profitable, as it allows her to cover the household costs without any problem.

However, because she is an enterprising woman, these inconveniences do not stop her.  In the future, she plans to expand her shoe merchandise since she wants to set up a small store in a market close to her house.  This is her third loan with MFP and she promises to make her payments on time, as she does not want to leave a bad impression with the people that made this loan possible and will allow her to continue working in search of progress.

For this reason, she has been left with the responsibility of securing education for her children who have been by her side.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer work involves buying sodas for eventual resale.  Gladys manages her business alone from home and has been performing this type of work for almost two years.  She decided to start this business to generate household income because she needed help with the finances.  What she enjoys most about her work is having time to engage in other activities.  As a result, she is able to generate extra income from home because she can devote the time.  What she does not like is that sometimes there are customers who ask for credit but then are slow in repaying.  She says the best thing is that she always has customers who are eager to cool off because of the intense heat around this time of year in the city.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  She feels comfortable working with MFP because of the low interest rates and affordable insurance.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

His daughter is a senior student in a local high school. Ayush started a small shoe-making business with his wife in the early 1990s. He decided to pursue a small private business after the Mongolian economy translated into a free market economy in the 1990s. Ayush makes warm traditional boots. Their customers are mostly herders who need warm and well-built shoes for harsh winters. Since they have been in the business almost twenty years, they receive shoe-orders from many herders from different parts of the country.

This financing will be used to increase their working capital so they can buy raw materials in quantity for high sales days, higher capacity stoves so that they can produce more efficiently, to improve the appearance of their sales stalls so that customers will be more comfortable.

son Alvarilio, aged 20.  They reside together in Dominica's house.  Each day they have to get up very early to care for the fields where they cultivate diverse types of vegetables, including especially, carrots, green peas, and beans.  With the help of her mother and son, she carries out this work daily.  Dominica sells her entire production to wholesalers in the city market.  For this reason, it is important that the harvest be a good one.  Besides, she likes the work because it helps her out economically.  She also raises pigs and sells them from time to time.\r\n\r\nSince she is an enterprising woman with a strong desire to work, she is considering sowing more crops in the future to sell and obtain added earnings.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  livestock and a vegetable plantation. Her husband Alejandro, who is 42 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are between 5 and 19 years old. \r\n\r\nLiza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, with which she intends to obtain additional capital for the livestock and vegetables plantation so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of her business and for the education of her children. Liza A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

","en":"Florinda is from the town of Los V\u00edveros, which is located in the State of Michoac\u00e1n.  She is 40 years old and studied up to the 5th year of elementary school.  She couldn't continue her studies because her parents didn't want to support her (they didn't have the money to buy her uniform and notebooks).\r\n\r\nFlorinda is married to Eliseo who is a laborer.  They have been married for 16 years and have two children: 16 year-old Jos\u00e9 Armando and 11 year-old Alex.  She tells us that her eldest son isn't continuing his studies right now because she didn't have enough money to buy his school supplies this year.  For that reason, he can't attend school.  Her youngest son is in his 6th year of elementary school.\r\n\r\nFlorinda is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to invest in her grocery store, buying eggs, flour, sugar, etc.  She will also invest in buying manure, fertilizers and sprays for her avocado orchard.  Florinda also sells meals to the people who work opposite her home extracting materials from the sandbanks.\r\n\r\nOne of Florinda's worries is the fact that her eldest son is not studying due to a lack of resources.  She hopes that she will be able to put him back into school next year since she doesn't want him to continue losing years.  Florinda tells us: \"I want my children to have a career because the life of a laborer is very hard and wearing\".  She says that this loan will help her a lot because she will be able to save so that her oldest son can go to school and have a career which is the most important thing for her.\r\n\r\nOne of Florinda's goals is to be able to stock her grocery store with more products such as dairy goods and cold cuts.
