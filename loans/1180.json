That way, he takes maximum advantage of every parcel. Now he is planning to start weeding his crops because every three months the weeds impede the growth of his plants. This is his second loan with Kiva and he is grateful for the financial help that he is receiving to move forward. He also promises to make his payments punctually. Gerson will invest the 1,000 soles in purchasing organic fertilizer to nourish his planted fields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1391841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to

Starting when she was a girl, she learned to take care of her crops, since she has land where she grows coffee and citrus fruits. She earns a very good income thanks to this produce, but since coffee is unstable in the market, she also buys and sells fruit. For this, she outfitted a space in her house where every day she collects mature citrus fruit that she sells to wholesale merchants. She also makes the most of selling her own harvests, from which she receives additional income. Now she wants to improve the coffee crop, since thanks to the variety she planted this year she did not have many losses with the insect infestation. This is her second loan with Kiva, and she feels thankful for the support that she receives to move ahead. She also promises to make her loan repayments in a punctual manner. Juana will use the 2000 soles to buy organic fertilizer to nourish her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1391890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to

He now has a few head of cattle, but would like to increase their number to expand his business and earn more money.\r\n\r\nGulom has 4 wonderful children and he wants them to grow up health and well-educated. He himself could not go to school due to financial problems. He has big plans for the future and is doing everything he can to achieve his goals. Gulom is teaching his oldest son how to properly care for cattle and has given him some cattle of his own. His son likes to take care of the cattle and always helps his father. For the moment Gulom is planning to increase his herds because it is currently profitable to buy livestock. He wants to use the loan to buy cattle and expand his business. He thanks Arvand in advance for their help and

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of five children. Her husband is a rickshaw driver, by profession. For the past many days, his rickshaw has not been working properly. Because of this, he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it, as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore Qaisra, as a member of this three-person group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. She will use the loan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will enable him to resume his business. Qaisra is so much thankful to

She received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, a so called Start-Up program, which gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.\r\n\r\nWith the loan of $2700, Nana will open a grocery store. She will purchase a stock of groceries and household goods. As the grocery shop is opened, Nana will become financially independent.

Aside from her variety store, she also has a farm. She used her previous loan as additional capital, and her income supported her family's everyday expenses. At her age, she still works to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another loan, this time in the amount of 50,000 PHP. She will use it to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products, to add to her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to continue meeting her family's daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with happiness, and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nGloria dreams to be more successful in her business and hopes to have a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

televisions. He is a very honest and punctual person.  He has been involved in this business for more than 10 years.  During this period, he has greatly expanded his business thanks to his efforts and persistence. Tolib has been borrowing with Avrand for several years. During the time he was taking out loans, he has shown himself in the best light. His wife works at a government office, and also adds her income to the family budget. He has two adult sons, who also work. Tolib purchases merchandise from suppliers, and it is very convenient for him.  Recently, Tolib has repaired his home, which was in a very poor condition,  and all of his savings have gone towards the repairs.  Now, Tolib wants to obtain new merchandise from his suppliers, but he does not have enough money, so he has once again turned to Avrand.  He is very hopeful that Avrand can once again support him and that he can further expand his business."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1385980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy household appliances","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-07-19T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-18T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tolib","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":221.3},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":226.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":231.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":236.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":241.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":246.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":252.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":257.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":263.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":268.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":274.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":280.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":584350,"name":"Sevao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sevao is 36 years old and married with 4 children.

The profits from her business will definitely help her sustain her daily needs and educational expenses of her children.  She looks forward to this financial increase with gratitude.\r\n\r\nNenita hopes to be more successful in her business and dreams of having a good future.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

He helps his wife manage their own farm of rice and also raises pigs, distills Khmer white wine and provides milling services to local farmers. He has been doing these business activities for more than 10 years.\r\n\r\nHe is applying for a loan from HKL, one of Kiva's partners, to help him to use as rolling capital for the purchase of rice for milling. After removing the covering of the rice seed, he can sell his rice to local traders for a profitable price, which he will use for home expenses, allowances for his children, and for paying back to the loan to HKL.

He tried to take a loan from banks and other organizations, but he does not have any property against security. Nasreen requested a loan of 50,000 PKR (Pakistani rupees) from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan because the BRAC Pakistan provided the facility to empower poor people without asking about assets.\r\n\r\nNasreen wants to provide higher education to her children.

At the beginning he faced obstacles to expand his business, but through his previous Al Majmoua acquired loans, Ahab was capable of buying a small truck to transport his merchandise easily.\r\nAhab has an additional source of income. Since his family is dear to him, he has to be ready for any sudden request, which is why he has been working in a small cafe where he has been responsible for the hookah section for five years.\r\n\r\nToday, Ahab is applying for a loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua to buy iron scraps at a very good price and sell it at a very good price too, in addition to paying his children's school fees.

They both work at a local petrol station and get a small monthly income.Their mother works as a kitchen maid at a local restaurant. As the family expenses exceed the total income, Tamaz decided to start his own business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts was unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The start-up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poors and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $300 to open a bakery. George thinks that the business will be profitable, as it is in a great location and the only business of this kind in the area. \r\n\r\nAfter the bakery is opened, the family will have a stable income which enables them to cover everyday costs as well as expand the business in future.

She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to buy more wood to expand her business.

He renews the interior parts of the engines of vehicles, renews the turbines and radiators. Her husband does lots of hard work for the sake of getting income for one day. \r\n\r\nHer husband wants to buy used spare parts of vehicles at cheap rates so that he can renew them and to sell them for high rates. But for this purpose he has insufficient money.\r\n\r\nShumaila requested a loan of PKR 40,000 from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband would be able to turn his business towards progress.\r\nShumaila hopes that this loan will improve the business of her husband positively.

On his small farm of 16.8 acres he grows corn, beans, cabbage and coffee. Coffee is his main source of income and in the last three seasons he has harvested 150, 300 and 200 quintals of Pergamini coffee from an area of 8.4 acres. The last harvest was smaller due to a blight problem which affected the country's coffee plantations.

She lives in a traditional family with her husband, her co-spouse, and her children and grandchildren in the second district of Segou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali.) \r\n\r\nNot having been at school for certain reasons, her parents being too conservative, she began petty trade together with her mother who sold cotton clothing. After several years passed at her mother's side, Madame Fatoumata went out on her own, selling fruit juice and ice. She has been in the same business for 20 years and is well-known for it. She constantly receives orders when there are important ceremonies (marriages, baptisms, funerals, etc.)\r\n\r\nTo make her juice she uses sugar, ginger, tamarind (a highly regarded exotic fruit), envelopes of vanilla sugar and juice powder (banana and orange). All this is  mixed into three liters of water to obtain an excellent flavor. The drink she makes in this way is put  into carefully  washed jerrycans, which are finally put in the refrigerator to cool. \r\n\r\nWishing to grow her stock of ingredients so as to meet the demand of her clientele during this holy season of fasting, she is asking for another loan. She has been dealing with the institution for 72 months and has correctly reimbursed four solidarity loans and four individual loans. She is on her fifth individual loan which she intends to use to buy three sacks of sugar and six cartons of juice powder. She buys her ingredients right where she lives and works. \r\n\r\nMadame Fatoumata sells for cash and credit to a clientele composed of men and women. She expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse her loan and pay her electric bills. \r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1392566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy ingredients to make juices.

It is made up of 10 members and is run through a directive board. Susana is the Chairwoman of the board. The members of the community association have various businesses, including: milk sales, cattle sales, corner stores and cheese sales. \r\n\r\nThe loan requested will benefit a number of small businesses, Susana's business among them. This is the first time Pro Mujer has taken part and Susana found out about the opportunity through a friend who is a member of the institution. Currently, she runs a business producing and selling cheese.

She lives in Sagarejo District with her husband George and 16-year-old daughter, who goes to school. Manana requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGeorge is an artisan of plastic doors and windows, but nowadays he is unemployed. Unfortunately the family is out of a source of income. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nManana requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Manana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

As a single mother, she cares for her 4 children, all of them minors, with a lot of love in her own house made of rustic materials. Starting very early every morning, she goes to the regional foods stall she has at the edge of the bridge, where for 8 years she has sold her different products as well as fresh fruit-based soft drinks. She says that on Saturdays and Sundays she earns a good income. Her greatest ambition is to be able to improve her business in order to earn more money that will allow her to cover her children's expenses, since the child support she receives from her ex-husband is not enough to be able to give them a good education.

She began her business because she wants to get a source of income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is that sometimes the bowls break in transport. \r\n\r\nRugiatu requires a loan in order to buy cups, food containers and plates to sell.

She works as a cleaner in the Kids store and gets a small monthly salary. Her son is an artisan and works on special orders. The existing income is only enough to cover everyday expenses. So Nana decided to start up a grocery store to increase the family income but she needs financial support to implement her plan. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Nana lacks access to financial institutions to obtain credit to start a business, as they require a stable income and business experience. She received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so called Start-up Program, that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nWith the loan of 1,200 $ Nana will purchase basic groceries to set up a grocery store.

She is one of the members of Nongpok Ningthou Group. She is the featured borrower member for the group, and she is pictured with a raised hand. \r\n\r\nThe group comprises seven women members, and all of them are quarry workers. Besides running their businesses to supplement their income, all the group members joined hands for renting the land for a quarry and generating income by sand-sieving. The other group members are also engaged in weaving and tailoring, also during the off-season of sand-sieving. Subadani says to earn as a hired quarry worker, the pay is very little. Therefore, the group members contributed equally for the rented plot and manage to earn a better income.\r\n\r\nSubadani runs a shop which is located on the front side of her house plot, which is adjacent to the main lane in the village. She sells betel nuts, betel leaves, potatoes, various cereals, sugar, tea leaves, edible oils, ginger, onions and all essential daily items. With the meager income, she also shares the family expenses with her husband, who is a driver by profession. \r\n\r\nShe usually gets the supplies from the main market and sells them in the village with a little profit. She says that during farming season, sales go down because most of her customers are farmers or daily wage-earners. Therefore, she also closes her shop for a time and engages herself along with the other group members and starts quarry work. With the income from both the shop and the quarry, she opened a bank account and started saving. She also joined a savings group along with the other group members.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase coated jewelry and summer garments. She will sell them in the shop and also take them door to door. She says the place where she lives is mostly inhabited by Meetei people, and these people use jewelry for many occasions and rituals. She wanted to sell them before the festive season starts. In both ways, jewelry and garments can be sold with the same purpose. \r\n\r\nSubadani thanked Kiva and WSDS. She says, \u201cGod helps those who helps themselves, and our group is a very hardworking group. Kiva and WSDS are a blessing in disguise. God bless the organization.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1383003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase more stock of low-cost jewelry and summer garments for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-07-20T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-19T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Subadani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanahanbi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sundari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thaba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":105000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T03:42:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":585347,"name":"Maria Victorina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria vive en casa propia con sus cuatro hijos, ella se dedica a la compra y venta de frutas y verduras, fresas, pl\u00e1tanos, naranjas, tomates, cebollas, papas, ejotes, chiles entre otros, tiene varios a\u00f1os con el negocio y eso le ha regalado mucha experiencia en las ventas que le permite obtener las mejores ganancias, el lugar donde comercia es muy estrat\u00e9gico para la actividad y adem\u00e1s muy concurrido de personas, ya tiene mucha clientela que la prefiere porque su producto es fresco, a buen precio, de calidad y con un excelente servicio; Maria  es una mujer emprendedora, dedicada a su labor con muchas ganas de salir adelante, siempre est\u00e1 buscando alternativas que le permitan alcanzar el \u00e9xito, en las \u00faltimas semanas aumento la demanda y quiere aprovechar para realizar una nueva inversi\u00f3n pero no posee de suficiente capital que la respalde por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar frutas y verduras por mayor.

At home, you think of the work you've left unfinished. Such a struggle is unleashed within yourself and your heart is rent,\" says Ibemcha, who is the featured borrower member of the Malom Panthoibi SHG Group.  \r\n\r\nHer life moved fast with an early marriage, and her husband left this world, leaving behind three kids in Ibemcha\u2019s hands. Her husband used to be a quarry labourer during his time, which Ibemcha continues after her husband died. She is illiterate, and that paralyzes her to get a job but earned through hard manual work. She tried all possible means to manage her family\u2019s financial expenses. She ploughs at others' farms and weaves to generate income, so that she could send her three kids to school and let them finish their education. That was her husband\u2019s wish, and she is determined to fulfill it against all odds.\r\n\r\nIbemcha makes her living by working on the river bank, where she sieves sand, stones and pebbles. She usually works as a paid labourer and is paid only the labour charge. After she joined the group and availed a loan, she could contribute a share to rent land, although it was small in size. She started earning more with the surplus income after selling the sand, pebbles, soil and stones from the rented land. She purchased school uniforms, and gave admission fees and school fees, and also manages the family expenses. \r\n\r\nDuring the rainy season, she weaves all types of traditional attire for both men and women, and sells the finished products for profit to the women vendors in the city market. With the small profit, she could do some savings and also managed to join a savings group. Her one wish was fulfilled after the inception of the group\u2019s formation, and she could have a share in the group savings. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Ibemcha is planning to contribute a share to rent a bigger plot of land for quarry purposes. She and her group decided to use the loan and their savings to rent a bigger plot of land for the said purpose. She said that just the loan is not sufficient because they require small and large cranes to excavate the land for sieving purposes. Therefore, they will utilize the group savings for a better outcome.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to let all her three children complete their education and get a job on their own.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also quarry labourers and engage themselves in weaving and tailoring when they don\u2019t work at the quarry sites.\r\n\r\nIbemcha thanked Kiva and WSDS for the help, and wishes them good luck, happiness and prosperity.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1382557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Quarrying","sector":"Construction","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to rent a larger plot of land for sand-sieving purposes for a bigger income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-07-20T22:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-19T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#PowerfulStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tilo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibemcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemapati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Piyo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manglembi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngangbiton","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoinu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanatombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":125000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T05:53:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":585295,"name":"Maria Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una mujer emprendedora de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, casada con dos hijos de 14 y 4 a\u00f1os de edad.

Tengiz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tengiz will renovate his minibus and purchase new tires.

She could have generated more income if the thread and yarn were provided by herself. She could sell her work in the village or to the businesswomen who deal with woven products and sell them in the marketplace in the main market. She also gets the threads and yarns from shop owners on credit, and gives them back once she sells the woven products in the market. A small portion of the amount is left for Lata at the end of the whole process. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase yarn and threads for weaving. She will weave them and sell the woven products to the women vendors who sell woven garments in the main market.

He has been working in the construction field since 2010. His work is specialized in floor covering. He also works at a local restaurant as a delivery man. Hasan works really hard to earn a good income and be able to live in good conditions, although today, he is in need of a youth loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l. to purchase a minivan.

The village is about 40 kms from the main city of Manipur, which is one of the Northeastern States of India. The literal meaning of \u201cChaokhat\u201d is \u201cprosperity\u201d. The group members join hands to prosper and encourage one another. \r\n\r\nRanjana is the featured borrower, and she is pictured with her hand raised.  Ranjana\u2019s husband is a paid driver. He is presently working as a paid driver for the district legislature. Managing the household expenses is difficult for Ranjana because she had two kids who study in private schools. The administration in the government schools in town is in fallout, and school kids are given less importance. Ranjana uses all means to supplement the family income. She weaves, quarries, and also runs a tea stall. \r\n\r\nRanjana\u2019s tea stall is located near the roadside of the village where they live. She wanted to run the tea stall at the main town market, but that is not possible at the moment. She needs a license from the town municipality department for registration. The tea stall is open at dawn for school-going kids, and she prepares toast, puris and fried potatoes, and serves the customers the morning breakfast. During the daytime, she prepares lemon tea, sugar-free tea, and milked tea for village elders. She usually closes the tea stall by 4:00 pm every day and does not run business on Sundays. \r\n\r\nDuring the farming and harvesting seasons, most of the villagers are in the field, and very few customers are left. Therefore, she and the rest of the group members engage themselves in quarrying. She sieves sand, pebbles and soil, and earns a wage. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase stocks of wheat, bags of flour, and edible oils for her tea shop. The small earnings are usually spent on the children\u2019s education, such as fees, uniforms and textbooks. Ranjana is typically left with no capital to run the tea stall with abundant supplies, due to a small income and everyday household expenses. She is planning to make more income by selling more local delicacies when she purchases the stocks. \r\n\r\nRanjana is planning to have her own vendor seat at the town market shed with a proper license in the future. She will save money as hard as she can, and will also pay back the loan regularly. She thanks Kiva and WSDS for fulfilling what she had desired for so long. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members also quarry and weave for earning.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1385832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase wheat, bags of flour, and cans of edible oils for her tea shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-07-21T01:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-20T01:30:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thaba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khambi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Itomcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chaoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T08:30:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":584577,"name":"Mamie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamie is 29-years-old and live in Sanniquille the capital City of Nimba County which is rich in nature resources, living conditions are much better than the capital city, and is the second largest populated county in Liberia.

She lives in a nuclear family with her \u200b\u200bhusband and children in the S\u00e9bougou district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nFatoumata has not attended school for social reasons. She became involved with income-generating activities alongside her mother who sold condiments. After several years of learning from her, she evolved on her own, ultimately to become a retail clothing merchant.\r\n\r\nShe has been in business for 15 years. Her selling strengths are the affordability of her products, her business acumen and especially the quality of her clothes.\r\n\r\nTo meet her customers' demand, especially for the coming holidays - namely Ramadan, the Tabaski (important Muslim festival also known as A\u00efd El Kabir), Christmas and December 31 -  she is requesting a new loan from Soro Yiriwaso with whom she has been cooperating for the past 36 months. \r\n\r\nAll  three individual loans have been repaid in full. This will be the fourth loan she will use to buy 50 lengths of wax cloth (colorful West-African fabric). She resupplies in Bamako. Mrs. Fatoumata sells for cash and credit to a clientele composed mainly of women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to make monthly profits of 50,000 FCFA, she will use to deal with family expenses and pay her tontines (participation in group savings)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1392588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural

She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nJenneh requires a loan in order to purchase gallons of palm oil.

In the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

He and his wife have four children - the two older ones are already grown and the two younger ones are still at home.  Like any caring father, Jamil tries hard to find sources of income so he can provide for his family's needs.  For more than 20 years, he has been involved in raising crops like grapes, apples, cherries, etc.  He lives in a village and, like other villagers, he conducts his business with pleasure.  He has a lot of experience and he knows every aspect of how to conduct his business.

When she moved to the United States four years ago, she wanted to create employment opportunities for herself and other immigrants and to provide high-quality African food. \r\n\r\nShe began her business with a $50 investment and started making kenkey (a fermented cornmeal dumpling-type dish that is a staple in parts of West Africa) from her own kitchen. She had her church community, friends and family test out the flavor. \r\n\r\nIn hope of expanding her business, she began working out of a commercially licensed kitchen in June 2011. Her business, Kadosh Foods Enterprise, does food processing, cooking, marketing, and distribution of Kenkey, Shito (a hot black pepper sauce ubiquitous in Ghana), friend fish, and shrimp. The next year, she moved into her own space, allowing her to produce and ship\/cater her food to other restaurants, markets, or events. \r\n\r\nThe largest challenge for her business at the moment is that her clientele is growing quickly and demand is high, but she does not have the machinery to produce as quickly as she needs to. It takes approximately seven hours to cook and prepare a batch of Kenke. One of the steps in the process that could decrease time is the vacuum sealing step to prepare the packages for shipment. She feels that if she cannot produce the amount her clients are demanding, they may turn to other suppliers. \r\n\r\nThis $3,000 Accion loan will help her to purchase the vacuum seal machine while simultaneously building a credit history.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1390954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Shaodat is the main breadwinner of the family, since her husband is a high school teacher and earns a small salary. \r\n\r\nShaodat has extensive business experience and manages her business by herself. Shaodat has good conditions for developing her business since she lives in a rural area.

They are a new SHG group and they all possess the same kind of business: they sell vegetables in the town market on a regular basis. Though they do not generate a huge amount of profit from this activity, yet they say that they are able to sustain and support their families when they manage the family expenses prudently. hough they carry out their business in the hill town, they all reside in the village, which is 1 \u00bd km distant from the town. They come to the town market every morning and carry out their activities. \r\n\r\nThe group is represented by Apabi, who is pictured with her hand raised. Apabi's husband is a daily wage earner who works in the field in the village. She has two daughters and one son. She sells some local delicacies such as boiled egg, fruits, tomatoes, chillies, dried fish, and she also sells vegetables and other items in the market. With the profit she gets, she pays the monthly and daily expenses of the children's schooling, and she is also able to manage the family's expenses. But the income that she generates from her activity is not enough to meet other requirement of the children and the family. \r\n\r\nShe says she manages the daily expenses of the family but is not able to have savings. The shortage of capital for the shop is also a factor that diminishes the income from the shop. She says if she can do some savings, which will be her capital as well as her future savings, then she is shooting two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will refill her shop with more dried fish, different local delicacies and other essential commodities. She will also open an account for savings and make sure that her son gets the best education to have a successful career in the future.\r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva and WSDS for their support and wishes them good luck in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1380254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

market. The town is about 40 kms from the city capital of Manipur, which is one of the northeastern states of India. \r\n\r\nKimneo belongs to Lenlai Lom Group and she is the featured borrower for the group. She is pictured with her hand raised. Kimneo is married and blessed with two children. Her husband is a farmer and during off seasons, he helps Kimneo run errands for the drug shop.\r\n\r\nKimneo has been running a drug shop for more than a couple of years in the village where she resides. She usually get the drugs from the main city wholesalers and sells them in the village with a little profit. Her purpose for running the drug shop is to facilitate the villagers with first aid kits and also to earn an income. The village where she lives is not easily accessible; therefore, she makes sure that the essential drugs are stocked in the shop. The Primary Health Centre in the village is defunct due to irregular attendance of the staff. The villagers and neighbouring villagers ask for first aid kits in Kimneo\u2019s drug shop before they visit hospitals in the main capital city.\r\n \r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more stocks of advanced drugs for the drug shop and sell them. She will also purchase baby diapers, adult diapers, baby soap and sanitation pads. These were not available before, but she is planning to include them once she avails the loan from Kiva.\r\n\r\nShe thanks WSDS and Kiva for the wonderful work that has been shown towards the group. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to let one of her children pursue a pharmacy degree. She wants her children to continue what she has started. She says, \u201cWe earn to live, but we live more when we could help others.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe presence of Kimneo\u2019s drug shop has been one of the relieving factors for the villagers. They can now purchase cough syrup or a dextrose injection available at her shop, and that saves the villagers the fares from going to the town market. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in different income-generating activities like piggery and weaving. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1385143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To refill her drug shop with more advanced drugs for the people around the village.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-07-21T15:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-20T15:10:15Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kimneo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneiting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sharon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamjalhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dimnieng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neinu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneiting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T22:16:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":584826,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine, who is married, works hard to support her family.

advice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been that person who thought I knew everything,\u201d Donnyette says with a smile. \u201cPeople would come to me, lean on me for advice and I\u2019d tell them what I thought. I always thought I\u2019d be the next Dear Abby or Ann Landers, actually!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in her hometown of New Orleans for 18 years, Donnyette has certainly helped many people, particularly children, through her work, even if she hasn\u2019t landed a syndicated newspaper column just yet. \r\n\r\nDonnyette\u2019s next challenge is taking her work to the next level by starting a behavioral health agency, strategically named Positive Direction Support Services, LLC. \r\n\r\nThroughout her career, Donnyette has worked with people of all ages, but her passion is working with children. Most recently, she has served as a school social worker in the Orleans Parish School District. \r\n\r\nBefore Hurricane Katrina, she launched a program at her church called Sister to Sister Devotion, which aimed to build self-esteem and peer support among teenage girls. This was Donnyette\u2019s passion for eight years until Hurricane Katrina displaced the group\u2019s membership. The now adult members of the group are still in touch with Donnyette and want to organize a reunion, to re-connect with what they call their \u201cfoundation.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the experience from that first entrepreneurial \u2013 albeit volunteer \u2013 venture that inspired Donnyette to launch her own practice. Positive Direction is engaged in a partnership with the Louisiana Office of Behavioral Health to provide counseling and teaching services, clinical assessments and psychiatric evaluations for children in the New Orleans metropolitan area. \u201cI\u2019m responding to a significant need in New Orleans for quality social work services that are offered directly in the community\" (in clients\u2019 homes, in schools and other settings such as churches), she says. \r\n\r\nWhile Donnyette\u2019s experience speaks for itself, finding funding for the relatively small amount needed to open her practice was a challenge and she is grateful for the opportunity to receive a loan. \r\n\r\nDonnyette plans to hire more social workers as she grows her practice and aims to build the kind of team spirit and commitment that she experienced at some of her past workplaces. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe kids deserve it; they didn\u2019t ask to have the issues that they have,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to promote hope, healing and wholeness to all the children and their families in [the hope] that it will become infectious throughout our ailing community.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo while Donnyette is taking on a new business venture and now must focus on the details of the business side as much as directly counseling clients, she maintains the same dedication to helping people that she had as a child.\r\n\r\n\u201cI still have that save the world mentality,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little different now.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7375.89,"image":{"id":1391009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To

He has a small farm of 5.6 hectares, of which 2 hectares are planted with coffee.  He has joined the business platforms promoted by the Asociaci\u00f3n Pueblos en Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria (PAC).  Through these, he sells the coffee he produces and the stores from other small producers located in his community, but who are too small to access micro-loan services because the amounts are so small.  The network of producers that he serves has 15 members in it, which has been growing since he started this work four years ago.\r\n\r\nFor this cycle, this small businessman is requesting a loan to set up the 15 small coffee producers he serves since he provides the supplies they need to maintain their crops.
