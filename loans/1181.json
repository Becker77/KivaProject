hard-working 30-year-old man.  He is married with three excellent children and they all live in a small village.  It is very hard to find a well-paying job in the village, and this is why Zafar has his own business which brings him a good stable income.  He raises and slaughters cows and calves.  Zafar buys calves for a low price at the market, then he fattens them and sells their meat.  His wife helps him in this business.  To sell their meat, they have their own butcher's stall at the local market.  Zafar already has a regular clientele who trust him and the quality of his meat.  He uses the income he receives to feed his family, but his children are growing and their needs are increasing.  For this reason, Zafar wants to expand his business so he can increase his income and fully satisfy his family's needs.  Zafar has turned to Arvand for a loan to buy three calves to raise and sell.  He is expecting a positive result and he thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1389932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-07-21T16:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-20T16:20:08Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zafar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":256.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":262.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":269.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":276.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":285.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250.16,"local_amount":250.16,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":250.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860033},{"amount":256.39,"local_amount":256.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":256.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136780},{"amount":262.77,"local_amount":262.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":262.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900977},{"amount":830.68,"local_amount":830.68,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":830.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550160}],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T14:49:39Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":584854,"name":"Girlie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Girlie is 30 years old and married with one child.

He is the father of 2 children.  He has lived in the countryside all of his life, and this is where he learned to do agricultural work 20 years ago.  He now works on farms as a supervisor who is in charge of raising and fattening pigs.  This is how he has obtained the income to support his family over all of these years.\r\n\r\nThis borrower is a tenacious man who is dedicated to his family and his work.

He has four children and has been doing this work for three years.His primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'rearing his animals'. His biggest challenge is 'vaccination prices of Animals E.C.F.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'the browns'.\r\n\r\nDaniel was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Juhudi Kilimo officer told us about it.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'assets financed generates income all the time.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Daniel replied 'he doesn't borrow milk anymore.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Daniel owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, running water' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1391311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She has an adolescent daughter who is 15 years old.  After her husband left, she has had a traumatic and very difficult situation. At the time, she was without a job and her economic situation was not good.  In spite of all the difficulties and obstacles she faced, she didn't lose heart, because she had something to fight for -- her daughter.\r\n\r\nWith vision, determination and a desire to get ahead, she started her own business seven years ago -- a store for clothing and general merchandise, a business that she complements with painting ceramic figurines.  With this, she has been able to obtain resources for maintaining household necessities and for educating her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for her second loan, to invest it in the purchase of more merchandise (blouses, jeans, accessories, watches), with the goal of offering greater variety to her customers, to satisfy their needs and thus increase her sales.

She is a very energetic lady with advanced thinking. She is thirty-eight years old and lives with her husband, two sons of fifteen and twelve years and one daughter of eighteen years, who are continuing their study. Presently, Premsi is residing in a small house with her family. \r\n\r\nPremsi has been running a grinding unit in her house for the last twelve years with the help of her husband. She grinds spices like chili, onion, garlic, etc., and black gram and green gram (mung beans), etc. for the tiffin centers (meals packed to go) and restaurants of the town. Around twenty tiffin centers and restaurants depend upon the grinding unit of Premsi. \r\n\r\nEvery day for eight to ten hours, she keeps herself busy in grinding the pulses (legumes). Premsi earns 300\/400 INR daily from her unit. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan for Premsi from Mahashakti Foundation. With the last two loans, she has added some new things to her grinding unit and has constructed a small cabin for her business. So she extends her thanks to Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nFrom the present loan, she wants to purchase another grinding machine specially for grinding of ginger and garlic. This will help her to give wider service and fetch some extra income for her family. Premsi hopes to extend her business into a big one and construct a good house for her family.\r\n\r\nAmong the other five members of the group, Anjana, Indu and Bina are running tiffin centers, whereas Kalpana and Dalimba are running a betel nut supply business and vegetable vending business respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1391254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a grinding machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-21T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-20T22:10:05Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Premsi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalpana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dalimba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":84000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":84000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T13:13:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":584884,"name":"Jaya Maa Laxmi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Katarkela is a remotely located rural village of Balangir district in Odisha, India.

Apart from that she is also running a dairy farm and a General Grocery shop. Her husband and two elder sons help her in these businesses. She earns a daily net income of 600 INR from the existing businesses. Out of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses in a decent manner. \r\n\r\n Hem is planning to increase her income by expanding the business. Looking into the demand of the locality, from the present loan Hem wants to put in a wheat roller milling machine. She is certain that this will generate a handsome income for her because in a radius of eight kilometers, this type of facility is not available.

This is the only source of income for their family, which is not enough to make ends meet for a family of four. In the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make living. \r\n\r\nSo, Tea decided to start a farming business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  Tea\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative, the Kiva and Credo Start-up Program, which gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan of 4,000 GEL, she will purchase three milking cows and feed for them. After buying milking cows, Tea will milk them and start producing dairy products for selling. \r\n\r\nThe start-up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased thanks to Kiva

Since becoming a widow 16 years ago, she has been caring for her six children, only two of whom live with her now in her own home. She has extensive lands in her community, and thanks to her hard work as a farmer (a job she learned at a very young age) she has been able to bring in an income to support her children. She plants pumpkin, corn, and potato, as well as fruits such as apples, custard apples, and some citric fruits. \"I have done every kind of agricultural activity in order to make the necessary income\", she says.\r\nShe has worked in agriculture for over 20 years. Her parents and grandparents taught her everything she knows; they were also farmers. Cipriana is currently harvesting corn and preparing the land for sowing pumpkin. \"I am working without stop, hiring workers to help me. I am sure that this season will be good\", she tells us. This is her second loan on Kiva, and she is happy to have this financial support to move forward. She promises to be punctual in repaying her quotas.

This is 33-year-old Fatmata from Waterloo, which is in the Eastern area in Freetown.  She is married with 3 children between the ages of 1 and 19 years old.  Two of her children attend school.  She started a business to earn a daily survival income for her family. \r\n\r\nFatmata has been running a groundnuts business since 2005, selling groundnuts within her community.  She works at the business from 4:30 and will not rest until the food is finished.  Fatmata says that the main challenge to her business is price control in the market.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy food commodities, such as cooking seasoning, oil, and rice.  The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business.  In the future, she plans to have a permanent business residence.  She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1391484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is a 58-year-old widow with three children, all of whom are working.  Life, indeed, is hard.  But, by the grace of God, she was able to raise her children well and to continue working to cover her everyday needs.\r\n\r\nSalvacion owns a variety store.  This is a small store, just connected to or just inside the house, which can be owned by anyone in the community.  This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo, conditioner, a bar of soap, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg, for example.  Salvacion obtains her products from a wholesaler at a lower price then sells it at a higher price for profit.  She also sells charcoal and rice.  Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby, and the people in the community.  She earns 700 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan in order to expand her inventory (groceries, toiletries, beverage, etc.).  This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.  Salvacion hopes that her business will grow and expand.

The extra income from this loan will allow her to grow her business and educate her children. In the future she wants to become a palm oil dealer. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1391491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict

She has been running this business since three years ago. She works at the business every day, from morning to night. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to purchase items such as drinks, cigarettes, biscuits and soap. The extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her children's school fees and improve her standard of living. In the future, she plans to open a big shop.

She works at the business nine hours per day and 7 days per week. Isatu says that the main challenge to her business is the problem of transportation -- to travel with her charcoal during the rainy season when sometimes vehicles break on the way.\r\n\r\nIsatu has requested a loan in order to purchase charcoal and wood. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and educate her children. In the future, she plans to change her business to clothing sales.

His clients are locals, as well as holiday-makers. Summertime is high season in Batumi, and his business profits allow Ramaz to help his parents with the household expenses. His plan now is to continue to work on his business and to make it grow. Ramaz applied for credit to MFO Credo. His application was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting vulnerable poors to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $2,000 will help Ramaz to improve his store and enlarge the quantity of products he offers. He will buy supplies, including sugar, soft drinks and snacks, to stock his store in a better way. With this financial support, Ramaz will expand his grocery store and attract more customers.

He is economically independent from them, however. Juan Ariel is a young worker from a humble family who works in agriculture, earning seasonal income selling potatoes and green broad beans that he grows on his own land in the community. Besides being a farmer, he has also recently become an assistant in a mechanic's shop, though he is currently only working there on the weekends so that he can spend his time wisely between his two different jobs. He has expenses in his line of work like buying agricultural stock and he needs additional money to finish a remodeling job that he started on his room so he can live a bit more comfortably there. His parents don't have a lot of money and so he needs to do this himself. He is very happy that he has been given this opportunity to be able to finish his remodeling project and he also tells us that he always helps his parents because, at times, they are not able to take care of his younger siblings when money is tight and he wants them to have a better future than he has been dealt. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1393091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"remodeling his room in his parents' home.

","en":"Nimatulo is a 57 year-old cooperative farmer who lives in Vakhsh. He has a 10-hectare plot of land; 8 hectares is planted in cotton, 1 in watermelons, and 1 in corn. Nimatulo himself works this land, along with his wife and older son. His two middle sons are migrant workers in Russia, and his youngest son and daughter are in school. His fourth son, Yokubchon, recently graduated from school and wants to go to college to study to become a customs officer.

Aiymbu has a good practical experience in construction.  Thanks to her diligence and patience, today Aiymbu has a good turnover in the business.  She also has a small farm with three dairy cows and ten sheep.  The family's monthly profit amount to 10,000 som (KGS).  The children are grown and live separately.  The oldest son, who works in China, helps her financially.  In order to further develop her business, Aiymbu requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sand, cement and paint for making cinder blocks.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further development of her

is a Kubo Financiero Client and this is her story:\n\nMy name is Guadalupe and I am 38 years old. I live with my husband and my two children in Mexico City, in a neighborhood called Iztapalapa. I have been in my business for 10 years. I sell different kind of stuff depending on the season. Sometimes I sell toys and clothes, and sometimes jewelry such as earrings, bracelets, necklaces, chains and rings made of gold.  I also sell coffee, chocolate, sandwiches and other meals on sundays for breakfast.\n\nI will use this credit to buy gold bangles, chains and rings for my jewelry business. For my breakfast business I will use the credit to buy tuna and sugar in bulk because it is cheaper.  With this loan, I am hoping to expand my business and to gain higher profits. My biggest accomplishments are expanding my business, buying land and giving my two children a good

In order to increase livestock headcount, Gulkhan requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cattle for raising.  Gulkhan wants to use the earnings from the loan to increase the livestock headcount and achieve a stable financial situation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1391452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

They manage to sell milk and eggs and sometimes meat also, to their villagers or city people. The income from farming has given them a chance to buy some furniture for their house.\r\n  \r\nLilit is asking for a loan in the amount of 800,000 Armenian drams to buy three bulls and a lot of fodder for her farm animals. She hopes very much that this support will be timely and useful for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1451.9,"image":{"id":1391673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Their total amount of monthly income is nearly $170, which is hardly enough to cover everyday expenses for a three-member family, \r\n\r\nSo Emzar decided to start a business and increase the family income. As he lacks experience with the new business and does not qualify under income requirements, local credit providers rejected his loan request. It was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This loan program provides start-up and re-startup credits with reduced requirements for the rural poor who do not have access to many credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the amount he is asking for, Emzar will start up a car parts store in his town and purchase merchandise such as engine oil, headlights, etc.  He will offer the local drivers a wide assortment of products and work till late evening to sell many items. Emzar is very hard-working and the type of person who puts family first.\r\n\r\nThis credit will be a great support for the family.

Rebecca owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, solar power' but does not have 'electricity, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

They are making such an effort so that their children can have everything that was limited to Enis and her partner (a good education, a good diet, good health, etc.) They will continue to strive so that they can achieve their goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1393182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 6 sacks of fertilizer and 2 gallons of herbicide to prepare the land where she will plant corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-22T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-21T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enis Aleida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":44.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":48.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":57.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":62.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.32},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.42,"local_amount":53.42,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":53.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814980},{"amount":55.27,"local_amount":55.27,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":55.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090812},{"amount":47.11,"local_amount":47.11,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":47.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856809},{"amount":48.08,"local_amount":48.08,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":48.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505084},{"amount":50.57,"local_amount":50.57,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716162},{"amount":52.02,"local_amount":52.02,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449621797},{"amount":293.53,"local_amount":293.53,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":293.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088042}],"funded_date":"2013-07-24T14:35:09Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:12:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Philip Hess","image":1178611}},{"id":585167,"name":"Sarina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarina is 23 years old and lives in Sanniquille, the capital city of Nimba County, which is rich in natural resources.
