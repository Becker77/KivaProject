Nimba is the second-most populous county in Liberia and is rich in natural resources. Living conditions there are much better than in the capital city of Liberia. Norie describes herself as a hardworking woman. She completed seventh grade, and she has lived all her life in Sanniqulle. She is traditionally married, and her husband works with the immigration. Together, they have five children between 1 week and 10 years old. She said that only three of her children are in school, and they all live in the same house which was built by her husband.\r\n\r\nWith a little money from her husband, she was able to establish her table business in the local market. There, she sells palm oil. She spends 10 hours per day on her business, from Monday to Saturday. One problem she faces in the business, is having too few goods on her table. She is requesting a loan to purchase more palm oil for her business inventory. Her plan is to build her dream house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1391843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is a 42-year-old who lives in Sanniquille, the capital city of Nimba County, which is rich in nature resources and where living conditions are much better than in the capital city of Liberia. It is the second largest most populous county in Liberia. She described herself as a hard-working woman. She completed ninth grade, and she has lived all her life in Sanniqulle. She is married, traditionally, and her husband is a security guard. They have eight children between the ages of 3 and 22, she said. Only two of her children are in school, and they all live in the same house, which was built by her husband. With a little money from her husband, she was able to establish her business, in which she sells dried bush meat at a table in the local market. She spends 10 hours on her business, from Monday to Saturday. A problem she faces is having only a few goods on her table. She is applying for a loan to buy more dried bush meat for her business. Her plan is to build a modern house one day.

They have three children between 22 and 10 years old. Only two of her children are in school, and they all live in the same house, which was built by her husband. \r\n\r\nWith a little money from her husband she was able to establish her table business where she sells fish in the local market. She spends 10 hours a day on her business, from Monday to Saturday. A problem she faces is too few goods on her table; she is requesting a loan to purchase more fish for her business.

They have five children between the ages of 7 and 24, only three of whom are presently attending school and live at home. She started her business with a little money from her husband. She has established her business and, for seven years, she been selling oil and rice from a table in the local market. She spends nine hours on her business. A problem she faces is her small income.

Olympic runners. He has three children. For the past six years, Kennedy has been a farmer who sells milk, eggs, and crops. He finds milking to be the most enjoyable part of farming and states that operating costs are the biggest challenge. Animals on his farm have been given names of Leel and Met. When asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for his loan, replied, \"low interest rate.\"  Kennedy learned record keeping during Juhudi's required microfinance training session. His highest monthly expense is farming costs and he expects his loan to benefit his family by \"increasing the food supply.\" \n\nKennedy is requesting a loan to buy a dairy cow. As part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Kennedy owns a cow, poultry, and a bicycle but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on their loans. Kennedy has a mosquito net and running water in his household but does not have electricity, solar power, sewing machine, a TV, or DVD.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

She is her late 30s. She and the rest of her family reside in Kampong Cham province. She deals with the daily costs of living by farming and trading rice. She has been involved in this business for more than 10 years, earning about 35,000 KHR per day. This is the second microloan from VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) for Savoeurn\u2019s Group, which consists of three female members. Savoeurn succeeded in repaying her past loan, and she has used it wisely to conduct her rice trading in a smooth manner.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', David replied 'he will get enough cash for upkeep.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. David owns the following: 'pig, poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'cow, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, running water, sewing machine, TV' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

Her family consists of her husband and mother-in-law.\r\n\r\nFrom last six years Puspanjali has been operating a cloth vending business with the help and support of her husband. She purchases sari and ready-made garments from the local market as well as from wholesale market 200 kilometers away. Her husband goes to different villages and weekly markets on a bike to sell saris and garments. She earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from her existing business, but the present income is like hand to mouth for her family. \r\n\r\nSo Puspanjali wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business. Looking into the present scenario of the market, from the present loan she is planning to purchase different varieties of saris and fancy garments to sell in the market. Puspanjali assumes that this will definitely generate some extra income because the festive seasons are forthcoming. Puspanjali has a strong desire to construct a house for herself and set up a cloth shop in her village.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Jasoda, Bimla and Rupa, managing a spice business, a general store and a dairy farm respectively. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1391862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing different varieties of saris and fancy garments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"RANIPUR, KHARIAR, NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-22T21:40:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-21T21:40:27Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasoda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bimla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rupa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":48000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":48000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T09:44:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":585296,"name":"Sami","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sami is a 24-year-old, married man.

He has three greenhouses where he protects his crops so that he can have a good harvest with a good quality product.  This allows him to sell his crops more easily at the market and generate income to support all of his family.\r\n\r\nHernando is an enterprising, hardworking, and dedicated man. In spite of the economic obstacles that he faced, he has always been able to move forward.  He wants to count on the support of a second loan cycle to invest in farm supplies such as fungicides, insecticides, larvicides, and fertilizers.and refertilize his tomato crop so that he can have a better harvest of his products.  \r\n\r\nHis dream is to have three more greenhouses since he has sufficient land to install them, and this will allow him to expand his crops, increase his sales, and improve his income.  This will allow him to offer his wife and children a better well-being and quality of life.

In addition to her variety store, she has a canteen and a parlor, and also creates handicraft products for additional income. She and her husband are working to provide a good future for their family.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nLorna dreams. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

married and has two children (one son and one daughter).  She has a secondary-specialized education and works as a nurse at a local hospital.  She has been involved in an agricultural business - animal husbandry and farming - since 2000, having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  Anarkan's husband helps her with the business by feeding and reselling livestock.  The family's monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Anarkan's hard work, today she has a small business, containing three dairy cows.  Anarkan has all of the conditions for keeping livestock.  The profit allowed her to increase livestock headcount in her household.  In order to further develop her business, Anarkan requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy livestock for future fattening up and resale.  Anarkan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further increase of livestock quantity and to provide a decent education for her children in the

This group is located in Tres Valles, a region with a high employment in pineapple and sugar cane cultivation. \r\n\r\nGaudencio is one of the members of this group. He explains that just over 15 years ago he established a small farm near his home to breed and raise pigs. He says that he really enjoys this work because it is his source of employment and it has helped him to support his family for several years. He notes that this job keeps him busy all day. In the morning he feeds the pigs and cleans their styes. He then visits the neighbouring homes in his community to collect the waste that people put out. This way he does not need to invest as much in food for the animals. He also sells cheese to supplement his income. \r\n\r\nGaudencio has requested this loan from VisionFund because he wants to purchase some pigs, food and deparasite treatments so that he can continue with his work. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to be able to make some home improvements and provide his wife with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nGaudencio appreciates the support that he and the group have been given through these loans. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group include: \r\nBlanca, who sells cosmetics\r\nJaime, who sells food\r\nRuben, who operates a nutrition club \r\nMacario, who works in masonry\r\nLucia, who sells snacks\r\nAmado, who sells candy\r\nMagdalena, who sells clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1393196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase pigs and food.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tres Valles, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-07-22T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-21T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaudencio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaime ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruben Dario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Macario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luc\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Amado ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4526.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698707},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4526.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698708},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4526.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698709},{"amount":725,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9053.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944860},{"amount":725,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":9053.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227934},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4526.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991779}],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T06:46:35Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T21:45:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Huras","image":null}},{"id":585417,"name":"Aluncia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aluncia is 50 years old and married with eleven children.\r\n\r\nAluncia earns a living by farming vegetables in the Philippines.

ISR, or Infant Swimming Rescue, works with children ages six months to six years old and teaches them how to self-rescue themselves in water.  According to the latest Center for Disease Control and Prevention report, \u201cdrowning is the leading cause of injury death among children aged 1 \u2013 4 years.\u201d  It is the third leading cause of death in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nISR begins teaching the children how to roll over and float until they are rescued. Children over one year of age learn how to do the same but also turn over and swim until they reach a safe place. These children learn to not overly exert themselves to the point of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nOlivia believes children and their families should have the tools necessary to survive in the water. ISR also incorporates learning about other ways to prevent drowning incidents. Examples include setting up pool fences, alarmed doors and locking windows leading to the pool when children are wandering, having a certified CPR family or friend prepared, and most important, effective adult supervision. Each of these preventive measures helps reduce the risk of children falling in a pool.\r\n\r\nOlivia went to the Small Business Development Center in Alexandria and was referred to Accion Texas Inc. for a business loan. Once Olivia received approval for a $5,450 Accion loan, she used her loan for training materials, website production, start-up fees, and certification fees to be able to teach ISR. Olivia continues to educate the community about ISR and grow her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5450,"image":{"id":1392133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

ha vivido en el campo y all\u00ed se dedica a la agricultura desde muy joven, actividad con la que ha obtenido recursos para el sustento diario de su familia. \u201cLa agricultura ha sido muy golpeada, nos vemos afectados por la guerrilla, por las vacunas o por el clima y esto hace que la agricultura sea una actividad muy incierta\u201d con estas palabras Adriano manifiesta su preocupaci\u00f3n por la dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n a la que se exponen en el campo. Es por ello que se ve motivado a solicitar su primer cr\u00e9dito, con el fin de invertirlo en el montaje de un negocio de comidas r\u00e1pidas, para lo cual ya tom\u00f3 en arriendo un local, y necesita comprar silleter\u00eda y mesas, insumos para hacer los alimentos (frutas, verduras, carne, gaseosas) y herramientas de trabajo (licuadoras, utensilios de cocina) para comenzar a atender a sus clientes y ofrecerles buena calidad en los productos. Para este proyecto contar\u00e1 con el apoyo de un familiar que ya tiene experiencia en preparaci\u00f3n y venta de comidas r\u00e1pidas, quien lo orientar\u00e1 y le ense\u00f1ar\u00e1 todo lo relacionado con esta actividad. De esta manera, Adriano pretende cumplir uno de sus principales sue\u00f1os, tener un negocio grande y organizado, que le permita ser reconocido en el sector y de esta forma generar ingresos para mejorar su calidad de vida, complementando con la agricultura. ","en":"Adriano is 37 years old, he is single and has no children. He has spent all of his life in the country, where he has been engaging in farming since he was very young, and thanks to this activity he has earned an income to daily support his family. \u201cFarming has been deeply hit and affected by guerilla, vaccines and by the weather, and this makes of agriculture a very uncertain activity\u201d: with these words Adriano shows his concern for the difficult situation people are subject to in the fields. For this reason he has decided to ask for his first loan, and he will use it to set up a fast-food activity. He has already rented a locale and he needs to buy chairs and tables, ingredients to prepare food (fruit, vegetables, meat, fizzy drinks) and working tools (blenders, kitchen tools) to start tending to his customers and to offer them good quality products. He will get support for this project form a relative who is already experienced in preparing and selling fast foods, and who will guide him and teach him everything related to this activity. This is how Adriano hopes to make one of his biggest dreams come true: owing and managing a big shop that will help him being well-known in his trade area, in order to improve his standard of living by earning an extra income that will complement the one from his farming

It is the second time that this group has requested financial help from Alid\u00e9, so that they can expand their businesses. The representative of the group, whose name is Assiba Jeanne, is the one with her hand raised in the photo. Assiba Jeanne is 62 years old and lives in Benin. She attended school very little. She no longer lives with her husband but is mother to five children. Some of the children are at school and two are her dependents. In order to provide for the needs of her two dependents, Assiba Jeanne has for the past five years been selling chickens, ducks and guinea fowl on a door-to-door basis. She gets her supplies in the north of Benin.

He is married and has three children. He learned to work raising cattle when he was a child with his father, since it was the only thing they knew how to do, as they had no education and there is a lack of employment in El Salvador. Every morning Pedro takes his animals to the pasture so that they can eat and in the afternoon he takes them back home again to keep them in their pen and not risk being stolen. Pedro has a yoke for oxen that he uses to help neighbors to plow the land and earth up their crops. That is how he gets other income to support his crops and his family. \r\n\r\nTo buy his steers, he has to get on a truck in his community and travel 45 minutes till he arrives in Tiangue. There he spends the better part of a day until he gets the animals he likes and later he has to put them on the truck and return home. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy 4 steers to fatten up with grazing and also buy agricultural materials for his vegetable and corn crops.  With the investment, he will buy his steers and have them graze for a certain amount of time to later sell them and make a profit so his family can eat and he can pay off the loan. When he has a larger number of animals, he will have more income in a more continuous way which will help his family to secure their subsistence.  \r\n\r\nHe plans to work very hard to build a brick house for his children, since right now they live in a sheet metal house.

Paynesville North has the largest market in Montserrado County. The area is home to 'round time marketers,' traders that travel to the interior to purchase various goods to sell throughout the county. As a result, there is a high concentration of wholesalers in the area who distribute to various markets around Montserrado County, including Monrovia. \n\nHawa is unmarried and has two children, ages five and three, only 1 is in school and they all live at home. Hawa was unfortunate in not attending school, but she is good at managing her business. She describes herself as a hard-working person. \n\nHawa has a table in the local market at which she sells palm oil, salt, onion, vita, pepper, etc. She has been in this business for the past four years and works ten hours each day.  \n\nWith this loan, Hawa will buy palm oil, salt, onion, vita, pepper, etc. to sell.  One of the greatest challenges that she faces is low income. She transports her goods by shared taxi. She started her business with a loan from her mother.  \n\nHawa is proud of her business because it provides for her daily expenses. Her plan is to build a house. She thanks you in advanced for your support!\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1385805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

From childhood, Bunafsha dreamed of becoming a teacher and after graduating from high school, she attended teacher's college and continued her education. She currently works as a Russian language teacher at a local school. Bunafsha's husband works as a lawyer. He also studied his profession at university and successfully completed his education, receiving a college degree. \r\n\r\nBunafsha and her husband strive to do all that they can to provide their children with everything they need. Their combined earnings are enough for an average household. However, until now, they have insufficient funds to cover all of their existing needs. Currently, Bunafsha and her husband want to buy a car. They have dreamt of it for some time now, as having a car would make getting around much easier for them. In order to buy a car, Bunasha needs a large sum of money. For this reason, she approached Arvand to take out a loan to buy a car. She thanks Arvand in advance for their support, which will improve the quality of her family's life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1388535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

Jes\u00fas makes a living raising chickens and hens in his recreational center. He has outfitted his home with everything visitors need to enjoy their recreational time, with sports games, drinks, and bird exhibitions. He has corrals where he exhibits fighting cocks, display cocks, or chickens for sale. He also rents out the property for receptions and social events. \r\n\r\nHe started this business more than 15 years ago with a small amount of capital. Due to the good reception the business received, he added more attractions. Currently, it is one of the most visited places in his town. He considers his business to be fairly profitable due to the good income he earns every working day. He decided to start this business in order to have an occupation he could dedicate his time to, because at the time he had a complicated financial situation.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'SEEING HER ANIMALS GIVE BIRTH.'  Her biggest challenge is: 'CHOICE OF BREEDS.'  Animals on the farm have been given the names of  'KILIMO.'\r\n\r\nBeatrice was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'TRAINING IS DONE BEFORE LOANS ARE DISBURSED.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'IS BEST FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked, 'How will this loan benefit her family,' Beatrice replied, 'I WILL BUY HIGH BREED ANIMALS WHICH WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Beatrice owns the following: 'cow, poultry', but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in her household 'mosquito net', but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

in the Nuapada district of Odisha, India. The lady sitting in the middle with raised hand is Banita. She lives with her five-member family consisting of her husband and three daughters of 9, 6 and 3 years of age. Her two elder daughters are continuing study in school. She has a very shy nature and always devotes her efforts to getting her family ahead. \r\n\r\nFor the last five years, Banita has been running a general grocery shop in her house. Initially she started the business in a low profile with limited items like potatoes, soap, sugar, tea dust, tobacco, chocolates, etc. Gradually she expanded her business and added extra items regularly. \r\n\r\nDue to her good behavior, her business has gradually grown and become established. This year, Banita joined a group of her village named Sai Ram with the existing four members to avail loans from Mahashakti Foundation for expanding her existing business. All members of this group hail from poor backgrounds in the below poverty line category. \r\n\r\nNow Banita is earning 100\/200 INR daily from her business. Banita wants to keep more stock for her shop but, due to financial scarcity, she is not able to this. So from this first loan from Mahashakti Foundation, she has planned to buy merchandise for her business such as sugar, vegetables, oil, noodles, potatoes, onions, dough, etc. in bulk. She expects to increase her sales and thereby her income, which will serve to ensure the education and welfare of her children. \r\n\r\nBanita hopes to build a permanent cabin in the center of her village for running her business. She also hopes to provide better education to her children.\r\n \r\nThe other four members of the group are Latika, Premsila, Sundari and Kalpana, who are running a spice business, a shop and washing powder vending business, a vegetable vending business and a vegetable cultivation business, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1392353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing sugar, vegetables, oil, noodles, potatoes, onions, dough, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BARPADAR, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-23T13:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-22T13:20:23Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalpana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sundari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premsila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Latika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":62000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":62000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T18:57:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":585565,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene is 44 years old and married.

She has worked all her life as a street vendor selling clothes, which means she has to go from house to house in various communities to offer the clothing she has for sale. This is how she has brought up her 2 children. She also has 2 sewing machines on which she makes sheets, pillowslips and other garments which people ask her for. Her parents were unable to send her to school and for this reason she has never been able to have a formal or decent job. That is why she found selling clothing as a street vendor was her only way of making an income. She has to walk all day to offer her clothing to as many people as possible. Sometimes she has to leave items on credit and return later to collect what she is owed, although this is risky as sometimes people do not pay her.\r\n\r\nTo buy her stock she has to travel to the city, which is a 10 minute journey away by bus. In the city she makes her purchases and then returns home to prepare the stock for sale before going out to sell.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will be used to buy various amounts of clothing for men, women and children and also to invest in some items with which she wants to improve her home.\r\n\r\nIn this way she will have a very varied range of clothing and will increase her stock with the aim of satisfying her customers, since she will be able to take them the sort of clothing they like. She will also be able to give them lower prices and avoid having to go to the city all the time to buy stock.

This is 28-year-old Rudiya from Mutare. Rudiya is a member of the group called Kuwadzana Kwemadzimai. She is single with no children. She cares for one dependent. Rudiya runs a retail business selling electrical goods, furniture and clothes. The business has been in operation for four years. She says the main challenges are late payments from clients who buy on credit and high import duties.

She says that the main benefit will be being able to purchase everything she needs at one time, while providing for her mother's health and food for the family. \r\n\r\nSelling the harvest will provide income, and the profits will create a credit history that will allow her to keep working with the institution. She expects to meet her commitment and be able to count on future support. She believes her efforts will represent to her children her desire to succeed so that they will grow up to be a help to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1276765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy medicine for her mother and to buy four sacks of fertilizer, a gallon of weed killer, and other agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-23T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-22T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090817}],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T18:05:12Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T13:19:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":586831,"name":"Kotobi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Kotobi fait partie de la coop\u00e9rative CKA et est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Aff\u00e9ry, une petite ville \u00e0 l\u2019est de la C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \u00e0 environ 2 heures de route d\u2019Abidjan.

children (two sons and two daughters).  She has a secondary education.  She has been involved in farming and animal husbandry since 2008, having started this business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  To-date, she was able to grow her farming business and has a livestock farm.  Her farm contains two dairy cows, ten sheep and five goats.  She also has 2.50 hectares of irrigated land, where she annually grows barley and hay.  In order to further develop her livestock farm and farming business, Nuruyla requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep.  Nuruyla plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further increase of livestock quantity on her farm.  She dreams of building a good, large house for her family in the future.

Together with her husband, she has been blessed with a boy, who is enrolled in school. She is doing fine with her business and family as well. \r\n\r\nFor three years now, Miriam has had a retail shop enterprise which offers a variety of products, such as dry foods, sugar, salt, flour, soft drinks like juices and soda, etc. She is also selling airtime. She works from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. (night) daily, and she is able to make a good profit per month. \r\n\r\nFrom Tujijenge Tanzania---Miriam: This will be her seventh loan request, which she will use to replenish more highly demanded and necessity items like dry food and sugar, so as to meet customer retention and attraction. With the previous loans, all of which she paid back successfully, she managed to purchase new missing items in her shop and to replace the sold ones with more.

The only source of income for the family is a small amount earned by Paata serving the locals as a taxi driver with his car. Several days ago he had an accident, and unfortunately his taxi was smashed. Paata was uninsured and now is requesting credit to fix the car.\r\n\r\nHis request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative of Kiva and MFO, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.

\n\n","en":"Rustamjon is a young and active person.  He knows all of the nuances of animal husbandry.  He is involved in fattening up and breeding livestock.  Rustamjon has four cows and seven rams.  His wife milks the cows and gets fresh and delicious milk.  She receives an income by selling milk and spends it on the daily expenses for her children.  Because Rustamjon receives a seasonal income from livestock, he is also involved in beekeeping and obtains and stores quality honey.

She is married with four children and she has two additional dependents that live with her because they are relatives. In 1989, Mariatu established her traditional medicine business. She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business every day, 12 hours per day. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nMariatu requires a loan in order to buy more traditional medicine to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business so she can attract customers and improve her family's standard of living. In the future, Mariatu plans to open a traditional clinic. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1392606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural

Warah says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation of goods.\r\n\r\nWarah has requested a loan, in order to purchase more clothing for male and female customers.

His farm consists of 10 plots on which he grows corn, beans, and coffee.  Six of those plots are used for growing coffee.  During the past two crop cycles, he has harvested an average of 250 quintals (1 quintal = 46 kg) of coffee in parchment.  Pests, diseases, and falling coffee prices are the main challenges of growing coffee for this small entrepreneur.  To deal with the pests and diseases, he decided to get more technical training, which is why he relies on the support of the technical team from the Association for People in Community Action (PAC).  The impact of falling prices has diminished since he is able to produce more.  However, this requires a greater investment of effort and resources.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, Nelson is requesting a loan in order to buy fertilizers and foliar plant food that he needs for his coffee farm.
