years. She stitches for the people of her community and uses the income to support her entire family. By this time, she has managed a good client list, but due to a lack of availability of funds, she is unable to meet the daily demands of her customers.

","en":"Jamila was a very happy woman. However five years ago her husband has passed away and she has been left without the provider. Jamila lives in a rural area with her children at this time. She has three children and they are adults. After her husband's death it was very hard for her to deal with family expenses. But gradually her children began to help her in running of the business. She has been running her own business for over 26 years. She does animal husbandry. Jamila has four heads of large horned cattle. She buys the cattle, feeds it for several months and then sells it on the local market. She has regular customers. She wants to hold a party at her house, but does not have money. She is asking for a loan in the amount of 3,000 somini to hold the event. She is waiting for your kindness and hopes for your generosity.

","en":"Soliha is an honest and purposeful woman. She is 49 years old. She is married and is raising three sons. Her children are also adults. To earn income she has been doing animal husbandry for over ten years. Soliha is the sole provider for the family because her husband Rustam is a construction worker and has only seasonal job. Soliha has four heads of large horned cattle and five heads of small horned cattle. She and her family live in the rural area in an old house. Soliha plans to repair her house, but does not have money.

With the loan, Aza will purchase all the building materials for the greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built properly, Aza will grow greens and various vegetables.

She later obtained a loan of ugx.1,000,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX) from UGAFODE which has helped them to increase her production and modernize her plantation. This motivated them to mobilize their fellow farmers to form a development group called Rwentobo Tutungukye.

Nevertheless, she is unable to meet their needs due to limited inventory. Thus, she aims to use her loan to purchase more onions to sell. With the new profits from her expanded business, Yvette wants to buck the trend by ensuring that all her children will be given the opportunity to further distance their family from poverty."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1392693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more onions to sell in her food stall business.

His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and restartup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Temur will purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver during his free time.

His request was approved in the framework of the Start-Up Program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, which permits the rural poor to start up or re-start businesses. With a loan of $5,000, Merab will build a greenhouse. As the greenhouse is built, he will be able to sow various kinds of vegetables.

In this photo is 28-year-old Gret, from Mutare. Gret is a member of the group called Great Ladies. She is married and has two children, only one of whom is attending school.  Gret runs a retail business, selling crating timber. The business has been in operation for five years.

is a Peruvian artisan who specializes in alpaca accessories like ponchos and sweaters, as well as throws. He would like to invest in the purchase of larger amounts of alpaca to increase production.\r\n\r\nNestor has been selling through NOVICA since 2002. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I hail from Peru's Puno region, renowned for quality alpaca and sheep wool. I have been dedicated to the textile arts for more than 25 years; it has been a family trade for generations. When I first began to weave, I worked on the rustic looms that I built along with other family members. Together we sold our wares at local markets until we were able to acquire modern machinery, which in turn has allowed us to develop newer designs.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you all for participating in this microcredit. It is a great support for artisans like me, because it enables me to invest in the materials I need to increase my stock. It also makes it possible for me to develop my new designs which I hope you'll like. On behalf of many Andean families, including mine, I would like to send greetings filled with the same warmth of our alpaca wool, as well as our eternal gratitude! Many thanks, and best wishes for joy and prosperity!\"\r\n\r\nUse this link to view Nestor's alpaca accessories and throws on the NOVICA site:

Odisha, India united together and formed a Joint Liability Group named \u201cManikeswari\". They formed the group to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the further development of their existing business. All of them hail from poor backgrounds. Hemanti is the one who is standing second from the right in the photo with a raised hand. She is 47 years old and resides with her husband and a son of twenty-five years. \n\nHemanti has a vegetable cultivation farm in her village, with a water pump and a traditional water-lifting facility from the dug well. She and her husband look after the farm. They produce vegetables like brinjal (eggplant), cauliflower, carrots, cabbage, chilies, cucumbers, papayas, ladies finger (okra), popcorn, etc. on the farm. Traders come to her farm for buying the produce. Apart from this, her son has an air compressor and vehicle tyre-repairing center in the nearby town. \n\nHemanti earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR from the above businesses. For future development of her family, Hemanti wants to expand her business by taking a fresh loan. This is the second loan for her, and she has planned to utilize a part of the loan to buy fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides for her farm, and another part of the loan for purchasing accessories for her son\u2019s repairing center. She expects a good return from this investment. Hemanti dreams to construct a house and for her son to get married.\n\nThe other three members of this group are Nirupama, with a milk business, Dashami, with an electrical center, and Prafulla, with a vegetable cultivation and vending business.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1391808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides.

She is a very tenacious woman who strives daily to provide well-being for her little girl who motivates her to continue forward always.  \r\n\r\nThis is why Dina has decided to request her first loan because she wants to buy more pigs to raise and fatten up and to earn income from the sale of the animals.

Due to a lack of education, it was not easy for him to find work opportunities. Because he does not know how to read or write, his only option was to be employed as a recycler at a scrapyard, where he has worked for 12 years. To complement his income, he has some dairy cows and breeding cattle that he raises and cares for, overcoming obstacles that present themselves, since farm supplies are expensive and the sale price of milk is constantly going down, which creates economic instability and a difficult situation in his house. This is why Arnulfo is asking for a third loan to invest in the purchase of a dairy cow and a weaned calf, with the goal of increasing production and improving his income through sales. This will help him achieve his dream of leaving his recycling job and dedicating himself to his family and caring for his animals.

Since 2012, she has been running a table market where she sells pepper, palm oil, bitter ball, etc. in the local market. She likes her business because of the ways her customers respond to it. She started this business with money given to her by her oldest sister. She walks to buy her inventory since her market table is close to the local market. She sells from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. six day a week. She is requesting a loan to purchase more pepper, palm oil, bitter ball, etc. for her business. She hopes to buy a piece of land and build a shop. She thanks the lenders who support BRAC Liberia to enable small business people to increase their business

with a mission to learn the on-the-ground truth about sustainable forestry and reforestation. During his trip he managed to forge his first partnership with Taller Le\u00f1ateros, an art which consists of printing and publishing their own books about the Tzotzil Maya on recycled paper. Upon returning home, he took action by recruiting a team of interns to help him start his business, New Forest Earth. \r\n\r\nNew Forest Earth operates like a business (selling unique products from indigenous cooperatives) as a way to raise funds for the charitable work (indigenous cultural development and rainforest conservation). On his website, clients can purchase the different products imported from the Americas but also donate in order to help the organization. \r\n\r\nAndon values the support of his over fifty volunteers and interns who continue to help him with website design, marketing, and finance and accounting.

The current crop yield he obtains from his crop generates income sufficient to cover his basic daily needs.

She\u2019s been in this business for a year having started it with the very first loan she got from the bank for which she\u2019s very grateful because thanks to her profits she pays for certain things related to her daughters\u2019 schooling.\r\n \r\nThis loan will be used to buy natural products and shoes by catalog since she already has several pending orders to fill.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank for a year and likes it because she started her business thanks to the loans.  Her dream is to provide the best education for her daughters.\r\n\r\nThe small photos are of two members who were unable to be present when the group photo was taken.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6750,"image":{"id":1395061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy natural products and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Ana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-07-24T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-23T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":6750,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nereliz Mariceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika Stefania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ana Cleotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maryuri Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarita Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanessa Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salvador Agustin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6726.86,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":672.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":672.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":672.69},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":672.69},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":672.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":672.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":672.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":672.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":672.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":672.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":674.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":672.69,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566799},{"amount":1350.01,"local_amount":1345.38,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1350.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815837},{"amount":1350.01,"local_amount":1345.38,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1350.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410966048},{"amount":1350.01,"local_amount":1345.38,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1350.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857784},{"amount":2024.97,"local_amount":2018.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506153}],"funded_date":"2013-07-25T17:15:56Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T15:59:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":587765,"name":"Fasso Yiriwa 1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les dix femmes de Fasso Yiriwa 1 sont toutes mari\u00e9es dans des familles traditionnelles.

He lives with his wife and their two children, who are 1- and 7-years old respectively.  Gustavo started doing agricultural work 25 years ago, which he learned thanks to his father.  Today, the work provides his family's income.  Currently, Gustavo has bean, pea and tree tomato plants on the farm where he lives.  To earn an income, he sells his harvest in the town center.  Gustavo is a hard-working, active and dedicated man.  He is constantly looking for opportunities that will allow him to get ahead.  That is why he is requesting a loan- to invest in the purchase of agricultural supplies (compost, fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides).  With these supplies, he will be able to continue caring for his crop and harvest excellent quality produce, which will increase his sales and his income.  All of this will help Gustavo to meet one of his main goals, which is to expand his crop in order to generate more income.  This would give him more stable finances and provide his family with greater well-being and a better quality of life.  It would also provide an excellent education for his young children.

At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRomeo operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, factories and others of the like. Romeo's  regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. He will be incorporating the loan into his current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors.\r\n\r\nRomeo dreams of expanding his business and hopes to have a house renovation. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She started working in the field of sewing when she was 16-years old.  She worked together with a cousin who had a large sewing business.  Blanca was in charge of putting on the final touches and inspecting the garments.  When she became an adult, she was tied to the business; she had worked there for four years.  Approximately three years ago, and with the help of one of her brothers, Blanca went out on her own and opened a joint venture workshop.  However, a short time later, her brother removed himself from the business because the sales were very low.  Even so, Blanca, out of necessity and with a lot of faith, continued with the business.  She hoped that the sales would increase, and they did.  She started getting contracts with third parties and now she directly employs one person and indirectly employs two others.  This is how she earns enough income to support her family. \r\nWith the loan she is requesting, Blanca wants to change out two sewing machines.  She will purchase one serger and one coverstitch machine with the goal of offering her customers well-made clothing with excellent finishing.  She will then be able to increase her contracts and generate more income so she can reach her goal of having her own brand, a line of undergarments and women's blouses and offer employment opportunities to others.  In addition, she will be able to offer her family a better sense of well-being and a better quality of life and give her children a good education.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJelyn operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nJelyn hopes that her business will flourish and dreams to have a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Presently, he is interested in offering a greater variety to his customers, which will help him to increase his net income and savings.  However, due to the lack of expenses, he finds it difficult.  Therefore, his wife, Rasoolan, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan.

The president of the bank is Silvia. She is 50 years old and has eight children, the majority of whom are now independent. She works selling basic essentials in her neighbourhood store that is located in the Bajo Irpavi district (from which the bank takes its name).\r\n\r\nThis loan is her first cycle with the institution. She is going to use this loan to purchase merchandise to stock her business, such as beverages, candy, cookies, groceries and other products. Her reason for seeking this loan is the high demand that she is experiencing which is causing her to increase her sales so that she needs to restock her merchandise. \r\n\r\nSilvia faces challenges in her business, specifically the competition, since there are several stores in the district.

He has been in the land cultivation for over six years. He mainly grows vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, onions and other vegetables. Zuhriddin has an additional income from animal husbandry buying and selling pedigree horses. He steadily grows his business and becomes competitive on the local market. Zuhriddin plans to grow his business further and increase the headcount of horses. However he does not have a stable and a good shed to keep the vegetables. In the winter time he does not have proper conditions for keeping the horses and that's why he needs to build a stable and a shed very soon before the winter arrives. He is asking for a loan in the amount of $3,000 USD to buy building materials such as cement, wood, sand and brick.

","en":"Nusratby is an honest and decent woman. She has already been given four cycles of credit by IMON. She is 52 years old. She is a widow and had 4 children. Her children are 20, 23, 25, and 28 years old. After the death of her husband, she provided for and raised her children alone. It was very hard for Nusratby to manage her families expenses, as she worked in a school for 25 years. Now her children are all grown up and have begun to help her. Nusratby really loves her job and is one of the best teachers in her school. Her pupils work in different spheres of society and Nusratby takes pride in them. Nusratby has dreamed of buying a Tico brand car for some time now, but as her salary is small and she is unable to have any savings, she has requested a loan. She is asking for a loan in the amount of 1700 USD to buy a car. She awaits your kindness and relies upon your charity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1392670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal

She is a mother of two children (7 and 4 years old). Natia's husband works for Georgian Special Forces and gets a monthly salary. Besides that, the family owns a small vineyard and sells the grapes seasonally. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the existing income is not enough to make ends meet for the four-member family. So Natia decided to start a clothing trading business with a loan. But the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Natia\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Startup Program gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of 2,200 GEL, she will purchase second-hand clothing at wholesale prices and sell it in her community. She will set up a store and offer her customers a wide assortment and well-priced clothing for men, women and children. \r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the job is hard for Natia, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her trading business gradually. The start up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased thanks to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1393518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

Her last-born attends primary school and is in class 5; the remaining children are doing jobs in different firms.\r\n\r\nHer husband runs a retail business selling clothes for ladies and gentlemen. The business has been in operation for almost 10 years. He says the main challenges he faces are competition from bigger retailers who offer longer credit terms and also high import duties when bringing in goods from outside the country.\r\n\r\nAllah Rakhi has requested a loan of Rs. 50,000 from BRAC Pakistan, in order to buy a variety of clothes to stock. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her more disposable income to buy food and pay rent and fees for the child in school.\r\n\r\nIn the future Allah Rakhi plans open more stalls around town and a clothes boutique. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1393506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is married to Ronald, a driver, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlaysa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nAlaysa hopes to expand her business and dreams that her whole family will always be in good health. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1393537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married and has 4 children (2 sons and 2 daughters). Since 1992, she has practiced farming - animal husbandry and crop farming, starting this business with 2000 som (KGS). Her monthly revenue from this business is 7000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work and determination, Yrsalatkan currently has an excellent farm: 4 dairy cows and 15 sheep. Her husband and daughter help her with the farm. The earnings have allowed Yrsalatkan to multiply the cattle in her household and thereby improve her family's well-being.  In order to further develop her agricultural business, Yrsalatkan requested a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle. Yrsalatkan plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the future expansion of the number of cattle on her farm.

So they have to stay prepared for the increasing family needs.\r\n\r\nYousra is specialized in making Kishek, a traditional food prepared from groats mixed with skimmed yoghurt and spread over a blanket (after being left for several days in a big pot to keep on mixing and assuring they are in the stage of fermentation), to be exposed to sunlight to dry and then grind them as powder, to be cooked during the winter season by adding it to minced meat, garlic and water. It then looks like a thick, tasty, hot syrup specialized for cold seasons.\r\n\r\nYousra is applying for a YOUTH loan from Kiva partner, Al Majmoua, to buy big quantities of groats, skimmed yoghurt, plastic bags and a few other things to increase her business production.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nZenaida operates a market stall. She sells fruits and vegetable products in the community market. She buys a quantity of fruits and vegetables and sells them per kilo. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of fruits and vegetables to expand her product inventory. \r\n\r\nZenaida hopes that her business will grow bigger and have more stalls. She dreams to give her family a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance

He is a very hardworking man and does his best to insure a good harvest, which is sold at local markets. \r\n\r\nAs the existing income is only seasonal from agricultural activities and is not enough for the family, he decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Besarion applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nWith a loan of $3,000, Besarion will open an auto spare parts shop. As the shop is opened, he will be able to generate monthly income and thus improve their living conditions. This credit will be a great support for the family.

With the previous loans, all of which were paid back successfully, she bought more soft drinks, beers and spirits. Fatuma also bought salon equipment, two driers and a steamer in preparation for opening a beauty salon. With the profits she earned, she covered school fees and household expenses, and she reinvested in the business and saved the remainder in a bank. She will use this loan to increase her stock of drinks. She dreams of open more grocery stores in other areas.

The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-start-up credits with easier conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Malina will purchase used clothing and sell it from her house among her neighbors. She will begin her entrepreneurial activity with a wide assortment of merchandise and high sales volume. This will increase the family's income. She wants to develop her business further and reinvest the increased income in trading. The new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. She is grateful in advance for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1393575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a stock of used clothing for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Nosiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":98.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":97.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":99.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":105.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":108.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":113.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":121.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.5,"local_amount":98.32,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":100.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857612},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":93.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:18:24Z","rounded_local_amount":95.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134261},{"amount":60.08,"local_amount":97.63,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":99.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107843},{"amount":61.2,"local_amount":99.44,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:38:44Z","rounded_local_amount":101.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255377},{"amount":63.5,"local_amount":103.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019507},{"amount":64.84,"local_amount":105.36,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":107.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670618},{"amount":432.13,"local_amount":702.21,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":715.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141249}],"funded_date":"2013-07-29T15:43:14Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:32:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":588792,"name":"Faida Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Fa\u00efda, est compos\u00e9 de femmes mari\u00e9es, qui ont en moyenne 32 ans, 4 enfants et vivent toutes dans des familles traditionnelles \u00e9largies \u00e0 Dio\u00efla, quartier Dougoukonon, commune de Dioila, pr\u00e9fecture de Dioila, R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro (deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).
