Anyak is locksmith and a tractor-driver. He has worked as a tractor-driver in his native village for many years. He is married and has two daughters, who are also married and live separately. He also has a son, who together with his father. is engaged in farming activities. \r\n\r\nBoth Anyak and his son also work at their local forest preserve as inspectors.\r\n \r\nFather and son manage farming very well and with pleasure. On the farm they have a cow, a calf, four piglets and ten chickens. Their monthly income that they receive from the sale of farm products covers their basic needs and farm expenses, but it is not sufficient to grow his farm and increase the profit.

When she finished secondary school, she left her hometown in search of better opportunities and with the hope of continuing her studies. However, not everything worked out like she had hoped. After becoming pregnant she needed to look for a way to survive. Under these circumstances, her entrepreneurial spirit woke up and she has gotten through it for her son, averting all obstacles.\r\n\r\nCinthya and her son of just over a year old live in Guaman\u00ed, an area in the south of the city of Quito, capital of the Republic of Ecuador. It is one of the most populated areas in the city and has become highly commercialized, with all types of businesses available to its residents. In recent years the private sector has taken advantage of this growth as an opportunity to increase investment and construct shopping centers, residential compounds, etc. Guaman\u00ed has some security problems because of several night clubs that have opened in recent years, but despite this the people do not lose hope. They can always be found undertaking business ventures that benefit everyone. They believe that the place presents an opportunity for having been the historic home of the Incas and because the local authorities have chosen to improve the sites that hold the city's history and implement more security in the streets.\r\n\r\nAfter experiencing the lack of employment available to her due to her lack of education, Cinthya gradually made the decision to start her own business. Three years ago she identified the need for a store in the neighborhood where she lives, and began selling a few basic products as a test. Upon seeing that it was in-demand and well-received by her customers, she rented a room with basic utilities that also had a space in which she could open her store. Here she works from the early hours of the morning until the late hours of the night. The best part is that while she is working she is also able to care for her son and complete household chores. \r\n\r\nCinthya dreams of someday being able to have her own house and see her son grow up in the best conditions possible. It is for this that she strives everyday to improve the service of her business and is learning to manage the resources she has to meet the basic needs of her and her son. With the experience that this young mother has acquired, she would now like to increase the range of products she offers and purchase some essential items that she does not have in stock yet due to lack of capital. For this reason she has requested a loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, who, through Kiva, will help her finance this phase of business growth. On top of that, it is very motivating to her that throughout the world there are people who believe in the hard-working and entrepreneurial youth of our time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1395719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She and her family live in the village of Lusahovit, which is in Ijevan district. She has four children; her three daughters are married and live separately, and her son is a student at Yerevan State University, Ijevan Branch, in the department of Tourism.\r\n\r\nAfter her husband\u2019s death, Narghush became very worried and doubly responsible for her children's living conditions and future. So she established her own business. She owns a small bakery, and she employs two workers. The employees help her very much to bake a lot of different kinds of bread.

","en":"Hidoyat is a resident of the city of Dushanbe.  She is 56 years old, married and a mother of four children.  Hidoyat has a secondary education.  She works as a janitor at a company.  Her oldest daughter is involved in sewing women's national dresses and has good earnings.  Hidoyat's husband works as a tea server at weddings and events.  Her son is a student and studying in the Hydroland department of the Agrarian University.  He started his second year of studies and now needs to pay for this year's tuition.  Currently, Hidoyat does not have enough money, and this is why she sees obtaining a loan as the only solution.  Hidoyat wants very much to have her son get a higher education and become a good specialist in the

She is married with two children between the ages of one year and 15 years. Two of her children are currently attending school. In 2006 she established her garden business. She began her business because her mother was a gardener so she was trained in that; she needs to generate income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nPatient requires a loan in order to buy more garden seeds and waxed cotton for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her level of living. In the future, Patient plans to expand business more than even more.

He lives with his wife, Nino, their son, an infant grandson and his mother. Dato's mother is provided with a retirement pension, and his son works as an artisan at the local brick workshop, earning 200 Gel in a month. Dato is very actively involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has two milking cows, a calf and a pig. Besides the animals, they have 300 nut trees. Dato is a very hardworking man and does his best to insure a good harvest. The harvested nuts are sold at local markets.\r\n\r\nBecause the existing income is seasonal and is not enough for the family, Dato decided to start a new business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests, because of his unstable financial condition and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Dato applied for the credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved as part of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative of Credo and Kiva designed to enable the rural poor to start or restart businesses. With a loan of 3,000 GEL, Dato will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse has been built, he will be able to grow tomatoes, cucumbers and greens. This will increase the income of their family. With increased income, they will be able to improve their living

She is 43 years old and is a permanent resident of Bolangir town of Odisha, India. The lady sitting third from the left with a raised hand in the photograph is Rupisha. She resides with her husband and one son of 20 years and four daughters of 18, 16, 14 and 10 years in a small mud house.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2010, she, along with five other like-minded women of her locality, formed a group named \u201cMaa Durga\u201d for availing a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to develop her business. To engage herself and earn some income, Rupisha started a dry food-making and selling business five years ago with her own investment. \r\n\r\nThe local name of the dry food is \u201cbadi\u201d. Traditionally, the badis have been prepared by grinding the urad pulse (split black gram dal) in a sil-stone (traditional stone grinder, operated manually). Badi is a food item which can be eaten with rice, even by roasting it in fire. It is also a food item that tastes very good when it is fried with onion and garlic and is eaten with overnight-cooked water rice (pakhala). So, it is very popular in Odisha. \r\n\r\nRupisha prepares six\/seven types of badi and supplies at wholesale to the retailer twice a week. From this business, she earns a monthly income of 7,000 INR. With this small income, she barely manages her family's expenses. So, she wants to increase the volume of her business to earn some extra income. \r\n\r\nTo acquire maximum output, Rupisha wants to purchase a grinder for grinding split black gram dal and purchase two quintals (200 kilograms) of black gram for stock. This will save her time and energy, and also reduce the purchasing cost of black gram. Rupisha is confident enough to have a business of her own and hopes to construct a house. \r\n\r\nThe other five group members are Bishakha, Sukanti, Malti, Sobhagini and Kunti, managing businesses of tailoring centre, vegetable vending, badi\/papad-making and selling, furniture works, and tiffin centre respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1393583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a grinder for grinding split black gram dal, and also purchase two quintal of black gram.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T21:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T21:00:09Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rupisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bishakha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sukanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sobhagini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-26T01:49:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":586312,"name":"Kha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kha is 44 years old and one of the breadwinners in the family consisting of eight children.

Ahora es viuda pero lucha para Salir adelante con sus hijos con quienes vive en el Pacto una parroquia del Cant\u00f3n Quito ubicado en la Provincia de Pichincha en la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Pacto est\u00e1 ubicado en el noroccidente del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, su historia inicia en la \u00e9poca preincaica y su nombre se deriva de acuerdos realizados entre partidos pol\u00edticos importantes. En cuanto a su econom\u00eda, es una zona agr\u00edcola y ganadera, debido a su situaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica y geogr\u00e1fica, lo cual tambi\u00e9n produce efecto en las cosechas de las cuales se obtiene productos de la Regi\u00f3n Costa como de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra.

She has two children who are five and two years old. She has for some time had to raise her children by herself, because she has had to overcome the death of her husband, who was as young as she. Now she is a widow, but she is working hard to get ahead and provide for her children. She lives with her children in the parish of Pacto, which is in the canton of Quito in the province of Pichincha in the Republic of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nPacto is located in the northwest of the Metropolitan District of Quito. Its history began in the Pre-Incan period and its name comes from agreements reached among important political parties. Its economy is based on agriculture and livestock, due to its climate and geography. The agricultural products of the area come from both the coastal region and the highlands region, and the people of Pacto make their livelihoods from these activities. Although far from the city, families in the area have undertaken all kinds of economic activities to provide for their needs and for those of their communities.\r\n\r\nGloria helped her husband for three years with their sugarcane crops, and she now grows sugarcane to provide for her family. She says that the education she received in primary school has helped her a lot with negotiating and selling her products. Gloria would like to grow her business to offer her children a better life, and it is for this reason that she wants to increase the size of her crops. She plans to buy seeds and other agricultural inputs to increase the size of her sugarcane fields. She wants to sell more of her product at better prices so that her customers recommend her, and so that she can increase the number of people who buy her product. For this reason, Gloria is requesting a loan from the field partner, who she says has provided her the advice, confidence and security necessary to be able to take this important step in growing her business. Gloria says she is grateful to those who support her by contributing to her loan through Kiva, and that she values this help very much, because her dream is to see her children become professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1395972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds and other agricultural inputs to increase her crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pacto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T23:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T23:10:08Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":804.44,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":68.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":70.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.43},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.08,"local_amount":52.73,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":54.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814471},{"amount":62.69,"local_amount":61.13,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":62.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320642},{"amount":100.77,"local_amount":98.26,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059908},{"amount":61.26,"local_amount":59.73,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":61.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995242},{"amount":43.89,"local_amount":42.8,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":43.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102322},{"amount":182.04,"local_amount":177.5,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":182.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212214},{"amount":19.31,"local_amount":18.83,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":19.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138221},{"amount":72.8,"local_amount":70.99,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":72.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832236},{"amount":228.16,"local_amount":222.47,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":228.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579564724}],"funded_date":"2013-07-26T02:46:57Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:20:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":587353,"name":"Maria Adelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda,  tiene 53 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, tiene una hija y vive en el municipio de Choloma.

She says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of sufficient capital to run the business.\r\n\r\nMarie requires a loan in order to buy more set pans, plates, and rubber bowls.

She began her business because she needs to create income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is a lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nZainab requires a loan, in order to buy more, and a greater variety of, pan sets and wax cotton fabric. She hopes that the extra income from selling the items she buys with this loan, will allow her to increase her business and renovate her house. In the future, Zainab plans to own a big shop.

Yemen. \u201cMy biggest dream is to be a successful father to my four children,\u201d Khalid says.\r\n\r\nA well-respected taxi driver by clients and fellow drivers alike, Khalid got his start driving taxis and limos 15 years ago after he spotted a beautiful Lincoln Town Car on the street. He wanted to drive the car so badly that he spent two weeks driving nonstop all over the Bay Area to learn every possible limo route, and he\u2019s been driving ever since. Being employed under a cab company has its disadvantages, however, as most of Khalid\u2019s profits are eaten up by the large daily fee his company charges him to drive under their name. Because of this, Khalid is an extremely low income individual and he seeks more financial stability for his children and himself.\r\n\r\nBy establishing his own taxi business, \"Belvedere Tiburon Taxi\", Khalid will take advantage of his well-established customer base and increase his profits. He will specialize in rides to the airport, while also providing regular taxi services to residents in Belvedere and Tiburon. He hopes that the business will grow to include other drivers, and that he can increase his income enough to buy a house and send his children to college.\r\n\r\nThis loan will allow Khalid to purchase a taxi license to establish the enterprise, commercial auto insurance, and car painting with his new logo, as well as provide him with working capital to start his

He is 18 years old, and he lives alone and away from his parents. Iwan's parents live in a remote village in rural Benjuring, Dobo, Aru Islands, eastern Indonesia. His father works as a farmer whose income is not fixed. The income of farmers relies heavily on weather conditions and seasons. His parents want one of their children to attend school. That is a happy future for Iwan; Iwan's brother works as a fisherman. Thanks to his parents' encouragement, Iwan is determined to learn in the program of Management and Harbour Administration in Commerce at AMN. The ideal for Iwan is to work in a large port in Indonesia. \r\n\r\nDue to economic conditions (his parents have no fixed income), Iwan volunteered to request a student loan from Kiva in order to ease the burden on his parents and continue his studies.

Currently, Elizabeth is a prospective student at the Academy of Maritime Nusantara (AMN), in the program of Commercial Shipping and Harbor Management. Elizabeth chose AMN because her parents can not afford tuition and there is a student loan program because there is Kiva. So Elizabeth can achieve her goals without burdening her parents and can provide greater opportunities for younger siblings to attend school. \r\n\r\nThis program gives great hope for her and her family.

She teaches from 7:00 AM -12:00 PM Monday through Friday and in the afternoons she plans the classes for the following day. She has been working for the Ministry continuously for thirteen years. It is the primary source of income for her family to defray costs.\r\n\r\nMaricruz approaches Ceprodel to request a loan to be able to continue making improvements on her home. She has been remodeling it over time with previous loans awarded to her by Ceprodel. She has been grateful for the help that Ceprodel has provided because her monthly income is not enough to cover these costs on her own. A loan with a considerable payment period allows her to pay over time in fair installments.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to continue improving the conditions of her home.

But seven years ago she became unemployed and depends financially on her relatives and her son. She lives with her father, since her only son, who is 34 years old, lives abroad. But she says that she doesn't feel good about being a burden for other people. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a very dynamic woman and she is very eager to get ahead and bring home an income on her own. That is her motivation to request a loan, because she wants to start her own business selling ice cream and snacks. She wants to invest in purchasing a freezer, install bars in her home, and stock up on products (snacks, sodas, ice cream). This will make the most of the fact that in the area where she lives there are a lot of children and no businesses that offer these products. This will allow her to generate income to support her father and bring sustenance to her home. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's dream is to have a well-established and long-standing business. She would like to gradually introduce a wider variety of products in order to satisfy her customers' needs so that she can have a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1395208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

In this way she will be able to sell more and generate more funds to be able to fulfil one of her main dreams for the near future, which is to set up her business in a place of her own and give classes in this art form to other people.
