She is a homemaker. She is very humble. She had to learn how to work, as she doesn\u2019t have the benefit of an education. Thanks to her own efforts, she did learn how to read. She grew up in her parent\u2019s home. She has five siblings (three females and two males) who help support her parent\u2019s work in agriculture. Her parents also make machetes and long knives. At fifteen years old she was married in the church. She has five children (three girls who are 20, 12 and 7 years old and two boys who are 18 and 15 years old). Three of her children study at the school in her community. The school is a five-minute walk from their house. Her oldest daughter helps with the housework. Her son assists his father, who is a bricklayer. For the past twenty years Maria has sold spices (garlic, cinnamon, cumin, paprika among other types of spices). She also sometimes sells clothes in the neighboring villages. Also, two years ago, she began to butcher pigs. She sells the meat to households in the village. She buys her merchandise in the city, which is located in another department. He husband goes with her when she travels to the city. She has to hire a car to get to the city. She makes this trip two times a month. It takes an hour to get to the city where she buys her goods. She buys the pigs in her community and she butchers them at her mother\u2019s house. This house is located outside of her village. This location is good for sales. Every Saturday she butchers pigs. She goes to her mother\u2019s house on Friday so she can get up at three in the morning to butcher the pigs. Her son comes with her. Her son actually butchers the pigs and she sells the meat. The loan, that she is requesting, from the Countryside Foundation, will be used to buy clothes that she will sell during the August vacation season. She will invest $300.00 in clothes for all ages. The other $300.00 she will use to buy three pigs that will be butchered. The rest of the money will be used to buy spices on credit. She will then have a larger inventory of spices to sell. She will also be able to guarantee that she will have pork to sell on Saturdays. She will have three pigs, which will last her three weeks. This will give her family a larger income. She helps her husband to provide the necessary items for their children. With the earnings from her businesses she hopes to build a concrete house and also help her children with their education. Thanks to her efforts, she has already purchased two pieces of land, which is where she lives. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1395661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes to sell during the August vacations season.

Her family is living in a rural village in Moung Russey district of Battambang province, Cambodia. To make a living, she has been farming rice on two hectares of farmland. She also raises pigs for additional income. Her husband works for other fees to earn extra income. \r\n\r\nShe has been involved with this business for five years and earns about 23,900 KHR per day. She is a group leader for a 2-person group. This is her second time borrowing from Kiva\u2019s partner VisionFund. She fully repaid her previous loan, which provided her with better living conditions. Now she is seeking a loan of 1,200,000 KHR, while her other group member is applying for 800,000 KHR.

In the future, Anju plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. Over 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer. With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.

","en":"Bakhtiyor is a resilient and tolerant young man. He is 24 years old. He is married, but does not have children. His mother is a homemaker. Bakhtiyor is the sole breadwinner for the family. \r\n\r\nFor more than three years, he has been involved in raising livestock. He and his family live in a remote area and therefore it is very convenient and easy for him to develop a livestock business, rather than production or trade. He learned the subtleties of the business from his father, who also is involved in raising livestock. \r\n\r\nBakhtiyor buys livestock, fattens them up over a few months and then resells them at the local market. His business is not only a source of income, but also his labor or love. He wants to develop the business further and to get a bigger income. From the profits, he wants to improve living conditions before the birth of their first child. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of 1,500 somoni to purchase livestock. He promises to repay the loan on time.

Sanobar began working in the field from a young age. After marrying, Sanobar began to take it upon herself to provide for her family, because her husband's health did not permit him to work in the field, which is the only work available in the rural area.  Sanobar and her husband are raising two children. She alone has to provide for the two children and her ailing husband. For more than 4 years, she has been engaged in the agriculture business. She mainly grows vegetables and grains. She wants to buy furniture for her household and has saved up some money to do this, but it is not enough.

She is in the business of selling different beverages and she also has a variety store which has been running for three years now. She also sells frozen and processed foods. She works hard to provide for her family's everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items for sale will result for better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense.

She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy chickens for her shop. In the future, Jamuna plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. In Nepal, the meat is always fresh. In small stalls along busy roads, open air butcher shops sell chicken, goat, and water buffalo by the kilo. The stalls are piled high with product and sales are brisk. With the help of a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase additional stock at better prices. This increase in purchasing volume creates greater profit margins for the

In the future, Manisha plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. In Nepal, the meat is always fresh. In small stalls along busy roads, open air butcher shops sell chicken, goat, and water buffalo by the kilo. The stalls are piled high with product and sales are brisk.

He is interested in offering more variety to his customers to help him increase his net income and savings.  However, due to the lack of finances, he finds it difficult.  Therefore, his wife, Ameerzari, has requested a loan BRAC Pakistan.  This will help her husband to purchase fruits from the field and sell them in the market at a profitable price.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php12,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nVeronica looks forward to business expansion and hopes to improve the living conditions of the family.

that learned about the Namaste Business Development Program through another group of women working with Namaste. One of the women says \u201cwe are very interested in having the advisory and education that the program provides.  We all need this to be better with our business\u201d.\n\nSanta Catalina Bobadilla is approximately 2 kms (1.5 miles) from Antigua Guatemala, Sacatepequez.  There are several different businesses within this group, such as \u201ctortiller\u00edas\u201d, chocolate making from scratch, mid-day meals, and catalogue sales.\n\nGloria Eugenia is a 39 year-old single mother of 3 kids (17, 14 and 13 years old).  She has a 7th grade education and married at a very young age. She does not receive any assistance from the father of her children and is therefore solely responsible to not only put food on the table, but also to pay for her children\u2019s education and personal needs.  To support her family, Gloria Eugenia sells mid-day meals to construction workers and tortillas at lunch-time.  When a construction job is ending, the workers tell her where they are going to be next and that is how she has been able to keep a constant clientele.\n\nGloria knows that she lacks the financial capital to be able to offer sodas with her mid-day meals.

She is a native of one of the neighbourhoods of the municipality of Chinandega located in the west of the country. Alcira is a hardworking, honorable, responsible woman with a great desire to get ahead in life. In her spare time she greatly enjoys relaxing in the evening with a milky coffee and cookies and listening to her favorite music.\r\n\r\nAlcira started work as a young child so she could help support her family. Then later she became a single mother and again went out to work to pay for household expenses, selling candy in the markets and bus stops. She managed to save a bit of money and used it to open a small candy stall in her house. Eventually and after much effort the business became a grocery store, a business she already knew about from her mother.\r\n\r\nAlcira sells products such as basic grains, cosmetics, nicknacks, frozen food, and items of clothing. She has regular and occasional customers to whom she extends credit, collecting payments weekly or twice a month. She plans to use the money from this loan to buy basic grains for the grocery store and a variety of clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1396970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy basic grains, cosmetics, nicknacks, and clothing etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-07-27T01:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-26T01:10:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alcira Argentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.53,"local_amount":1206.03,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1255.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399855568},{"amount":50.97,"local_amount":1240.94,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1291.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410130870},{"amount":48.91,"local_amount":1190.78,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1239.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419896527},{"amount":47.05,"local_amount":1145.52,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1192.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545830},{"amount":50.79,"local_amount":1236.57,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1287.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199582},{"amount":49.84,"local_amount":1213.49,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1263.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449668971},{"amount":52.79,"local_amount":1285.25,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1337.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459139615},{"amount":55.34,"local_amount":1347.3,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1402.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955386},{"amount":56.52,"local_amount":1376.19,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1432.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176167},{"amount":113.26,"local_amount":2757.93,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2870.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490870838}],"funded_date":"2013-07-28T22:24:05Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T15:56:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":586986,"name":"Chona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chona lives in Colupan Bajo, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental, with her husband and two children.

de la escuela primaria, trabaj\u00f3 desde muy joven aprendiendo distintas labores desde los quehaceres del hogar hasta la fabricaci\u00f3n de bloques de cemento. Mar\u00eda es soltera y a sus 23 a\u00f1os tuvo un hijo que ahora ya tiene su propia familia con quienes Mar\u00eda vive en Latacunga capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador y que los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. Aunque hay un alto \u00edndice de pobreza el esp\u00edritu emprendedor de sus habitantes ha hecho que la  ciudad sobresalga. En el sector rural y urbano se puede encontrar familias destacando sus talentos para emprender con alguna idea que les pueda generar rentabilidad para conseguir el sustento diario. \nMar\u00eda aprendi\u00f3 a elaborar bloques de cemento para la construcci\u00f3n de casas gracias a la instrucci\u00f3n de su hermana con quien trabaj\u00f3 mucho tiempo en esta labor, hace 2 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 emprender el negocio por s\u00ed misma, poniendo en pr\u00e1ctica la experiencia que gan\u00f3 con su hermana. Mar\u00eda invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en la preparaci\u00f3n del material, elaboraci\u00f3n y arrumando los bloques, labor cuyos procesos tienen un nivel de dificultad alto y hasta riesgoso, sin embargo Mar\u00eda ha continuado con la esperanza de un d\u00eda cumplir su sue\u00f1o de tener su casa propia para as\u00ed tener una vejez tranquila y confortable. Mar\u00eda solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en material e insumos para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus bloques, pues en ocasiones la falta de alg\u00fan insumo o material detiene la producci\u00f3n y por lo general los pedidos son siempre al por mayor, por lo que Mar\u00eda no puede permitirse una falta de producto, sin embargo en ocasiones ha perdido ventas ya que no pod\u00eda abastecerse de materia prima por la falta de capital, sin embargo alguien le recomend\u00f3 ir a solicitar el cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde gracias al producto Kiva, le pueden prestar la ayuda econ\u00f3mica que necesita para seguir produciendo y crecer en su negocio y de esta forma sumar sus ganancias con lo cual puede aportar al mejoramiento de calidad de vida de su hijo, nuera y nietos con quienes vive. ","en":"Mar\u00eda is 57 years old. She studied and passed primary school, and has worked since she was very young, learning different jobs ranging from household chores to making cement blocks. She is single, and when she was 23 years old, she had a son, who now has his own family, with whom Mar\u00eda lives in Latacunga, which is the capital of the province of Cotopaxi.\r\n\r\nCotopaxi is one of the provinces that make up the mountainous region of Ecuador. In recent years it has experienced a significant amount of development, such that it is now considered one of the most important of the region, thanks to its flower-growing, mining, metallurgy, agribusiness, agriculture and livestock industries. Latacunga, moreover, has many businesses that generate significant revenues and which make it a city of commerce with various opportunities to get ahead. Although there is a high poverty index, the entrepreneurial spirit of its inhabitants has made the city excel. There are families in both the rural and urban sectors that stand out for their talent for pursuing an idea that can generate profit for them and permit them to meet their daily needs.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda learned to make cement blocks for building houses from her sister, with whom she worked for a long time. Two years ago she decided to start her own business, putting into practice the experience she gained while working with her sister. Mar\u00eda invests at least eight hours every day preparing the raw material, making the bricks and then piling them up. All of these tasks have a high level of difficulty and are even risky. Nevertheless, Mar\u00eda has continued with her work with the hope that one day she will achieve her dream, which is to have her own home so that she can live out her later years in peace and comfort.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is requesting a loan to buy materials and supplies for making cement blocks. She says that sometimes she does not have some of the necessary materials or supplies for making cement blocks and that this stops her production. She also says that in general the orders are always in bulk, so that she cannot permit herself to run out of product. Unfortunately, on occasions she has lost sales because she has not had some primary materials in stock because of a lack of capital. Someone recommended that she request a loan from the field partner, where, she says thanks to Kiva, they can give her the economic help that she needs to continue production, grow her business and increase her profits. With these profits, she hopes to improve the quality of life of her son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren with whom she lives."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1396888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

The youngest child hasn't reached school age yet. She lives with her children in a house that she owns. She works an 8-hour day as a service agent in a public hospital. The house where she lives isn't finished yet, that is to say, she's been building it little by little due to scarce financial resources. That's why the money from the recent loan will be used to purchase sand, cement and window frames so she can continue building her house. In the future she intends to build rooms for renting out so that she can obtain more money to support her children. In the future she'll work harder and get more loans from Hluvuku in order to accomplish her

Animals on the farm have been given the name of 'Mzungu - European.'\r\n\r\nBenard was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he answered that his group members told him about the low-interest, asset-financing loans offered by Juhudi Kilimo.  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session, and he said he had learned that he can acquire assets and wealth, through small loans.\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is family living expenses. When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family,' Benard replied, 'It will provide enough food.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Benard owns a cow and bicycle, but does not own a pig, poultry, pump, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net and solar power, but does not have electricity, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1395251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-07-27T03:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-26T03:50:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4487.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4605.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4727.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4852.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4980.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5112.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5247.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5386.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5528.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5674.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5824.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5976.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.31,"local_amount":2350.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2375.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417421},{"amount":117.06,"local_amount":10075.38,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":10184.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980949},{"amount":54.36,"local_amount":4679.02,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4729.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880999},{"amount":74.02,"local_amount":6370.44,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6439.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343367},{"amount":166.16,"local_amount":14301.21,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":14455.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479164915},{"amount":117.61,"local_amount":10122.69,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10232.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859546},{"amount":18.19,"local_amount":1565.6,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1582.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287075},{"amount":150.29,"local_amount":12935.1,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":13075.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517571054}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T15:05:20Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T13:24:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":587004,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is a 45-year-old lady from the Homabay region, in the western part of Kenya.

She and her husband share responsibility in attending to their young children and at the same time, earning an income for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nSusan is a balut vendor. In the Philippines, balut is a well-known egg that is sold on the sidewalk. It is an egg of ducks that had not been hatched; instead, it was cooked as a boiled egg with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is a highly nutritious food that Filipinos love to eat, especially when they feel tired as it revitalizes their energy and strength. About 450-600 pieces of balut eggs are being boiled and sold every night. She and her husband do the selling to lessen expenses for the commissions of vendors who will sell it. They earn 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales per day. \r\n\r\nSusan is requesting a loan amounting to 20,000 PHP that she will use as additional capital for her business to buy more eggs.\r\n\r\nSusan dreams to have a stall located in the market. She still will have to wait a little bit more to make this come true because she has prioritized being a mother first to her young children. For now, she and her husband will just continue to lean on each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future.

He is a fishmonger but supplements his income with agriculture, specifically growing bananas. He says he works four days a week and each day he works for 16 hours because he has to stay out longer until he has sold most of the fish because it is perishable. He has been in this business since 2006 and he concentrated on fishmongering due to high demand for fish in the rural areas. This created a market; hence he is able to earn an income to sustain his family.\r\n\r\nHis main clients are hotels and families plus schools around his home area.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Paul replied 'mass production of milk means I will have a lot of money to keep my family.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Paul owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

He will be able to take advantage of this to improve his income and fill the available pig pens that he has. This way, he will be able to increase his milk production and fatten the pigs in order to sell them at a better price, with which he will increase his resources and his family's assets.

He lives in the small village of Marneuli district with his wife, Shekhla. The only source of income for their family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a greenhouse, where tomatoes are grown. They sell the harvested tomatoes at local markets at a good price.\r\n \r\nAs the existing income is not enough for his family, Famadin has decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial condition and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Famadin applied to MFO Credo for a loan.

She is going to use her profits to continue increasing her working capital. Her desire is for her business to grow and to not only embroider, but to also make a variety of garments. Antonia is happy and grateful for the field partner\u2019s support.

Due to her hard work and nice attitude toward people, Lusine has gained many loyal customers who prefer to come to Lusine's little cafe and enjoy tasty meals. Lusine is now more specialized in Georgian cuisine and cooks different types of meals which her customers enjoy with great pleasure. Lusine requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her start-up business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because her business isn't registered as a formal business. Lusine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. This loan is very important for Lusine to make improvements to her catering service and be able to meet the market demand.

He is married and lives with his wife, Nanuli, in the small village of Tsnori district, East Georgia. Both of them are provided with a retirement pension. Tamaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only other source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard. Tamaz does all the agricultural work and works hard to insure a good harvest. They sell wine at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTamaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

This group is located in the city of San Pedro de Macoris, in one of the rural villages surrounding the main city. Margarita enjoys working and being at her home with her family. She lives with her long-term partner and their three children with a new baby coming soon. She said that her most difficult challenge is to improve her business. She dreams of having a successful business and bringing change to her family.\r\n\r\nMargarita operates a business selling miscellaneous items like cosmetics, shoes, and clothes. She will use the loan to purchase dozens of these items to increase her business inventory.
