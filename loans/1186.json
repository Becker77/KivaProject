The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. Having more items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from her business will definitely help sustain her family's daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nLinda dreams that her business will grow strong and prays for God's strength and guidance. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

The bar\u2019s motto is, \u201cOnce you enjoy a cold one with us, you are one of us.\u201d Humberto\u2019s bar is located on San Antonio\u2019s Southeast side near popular restaurants, a movie theatre, and shops.  \r\n\r\nOne of Humberto\u2019s close friends informed him about Accion Texas Inc., a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping entrepreneurs realize their business dreams.

She is single and the mother of a young child who is one year old. She finished secondary school. She wants to work so she can find a way to continue with her education. Right now her life revolves around her child. One of the greatest obstacles that she has is the loss of her partner, who is also not interested in their child. Diana lives with her son in the town of Rio Verde de Santo Domingo, which is the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. This city has a many businesses, as it has become an inland port of exchange between the mountainous region and the coast of the country. The various tourist attractions of the city are related to the warm climate. Many national and international tourists visit here. Most of the population of the city works in business or services related to the local inhabitants or the tourists. Diane learned how to be a photographer when she was a secondary student. Now she has a business at a local photography shop. Never the less, her income isn't sufficient. So, for the last six months, she has been augmenting her income by selling cosmetics from a catalogue. She can do this while she is at the photography shop. She shows her catalogues and the products that she has in stock, while she is in the shop. Every weekend she goes door-to-door in her city selling her products and collecting payments for them. Diana's customers are mainly women that are also requesting other products such as clothes and shoes. This is why Diana is requesting this loan. She will use the money to start selling a line of clothing and shoes by catalogue. She will also buy seasonal clothes to exhibit and show to her customers. By growing her business Diane will increase her customer base with the objective of increasing her earnings. This will help her provide a better life for her child and pay for the household necessities. The lack of capital is always an obstacle for her ability to increase her business. Now she has the opportunity to apply for her first loan from the \"Alternative Foundation\". This Foundation has provided the confidence and flexibility that she was looking for.

He is a very friendly, hard working and enthusiastic person who puts all of his effort into getting his family ahead.  Unfortunately, due to lack of financial resources, and the need for him to work at a young age to support his family, Guillermo was not able to go to school for a professional career in agriculture like he has wished.  In his free time, he enjoys playing soccer with his friends, and on some occasions, he cooks a delicious lamb stew to share with his family.  \r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, and with a lot of dedication and determination, Guillermo works as a field laborer on an farm in his city.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJacel hopes to expand her business and have more income.  She dreams that her family will always be in a good condition.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, and to repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1334786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-07-28T03:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-27T03:20:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1731.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390535038},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3463.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784451},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3463.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771437},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4329.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824480}],"funded_date":"2013-07-28T03:52:12Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T13:13:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Vacha","image":1668411}},{"id":587400,"name":"Emely","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emely is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a vegetable business in the Philippines.

Ut has farmed her own pieces of land for more than 30 years. Through her sacrifice and perseverance, she aims to improve her business and better her living conditions.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to purchase a motorcycle, which her employed children will use to commute to work. This will reduce their monthly travelling expenses and enable them to get to work on time. A small portion of the loan will also help her to cover the operating costs of farming. Her plan is to keep improving her business and renovate her house in the

Due to lack of career opportunities, she went through a difficult financial time as she did not have the resources to bring money home.  This motivated her to take advantage of the lack of service offerings in this sector.  She decided to start working as a stylist, brushing hair, cutting hair, and giving manicures and pedicures.  She works out of her house or at her clients' homes, depending on their preferences.  At first, she had to purchase her supplies in small quantities as she did not have the capital to purchase them wholesale.  This allowed her to begin to get ahead and earn the income necessary to satisfy the basic needs of her household.\r\n\r\nShe is a hardworking and active woman with an eagerness to advance, which motivated her to request this loan.  She wishes to invest the loan in the purchase of supplies and tools for her work (hair straightener, shampoo, conditioner, hair treatments, nail polish) with the goals of continuing her work and offering her clients better service, and in so doing increase her income. \r\n\r\nLucy dreams of opening her own beauty salon where she would be able to offer a more comfortable setting and better service to her clients, and also give her the opportunity to employ others.  This will also allow her better financial stability so her son can have an excellent education and better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1397954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural

He also does not want to bother his parents, because his parents are too old to continue work. \r\n\r\nSartoyo is eager to get a loan from Kiva, to help pay for college expenses, so that he could complete his studies, get a job faster and his parents can be helped in their family economy.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1396134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay education fees for three years","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"CILACAP","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":253,"posted_date":"2013-07-28T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-27T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sartoyo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-06T01:37:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":587460,"name":"Flamboyan I Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flamboyan I group  successfully completed their first cycle with a loan from Kiva and is running smoothly.

The main aim in building the bathroom and basin is to have more privacy.

estudiando en la escuela fiscal y el tercero a\u00fan se queda en casa bajo los cuidados de su madre. Ella es soltera y ha trabajado cada d\u00eda por salir adelante juntamente con sus hijos. Jenny vive con sus hijos en la Parroquia Chig\u00fcilpe a 15 minutos del centro de Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Esta parroquia tiene varias viviendas de cemento y mixtas de madera con cemento. Tiene un r\u00edo que es muy visitado y en donde los turistas y habitantes practican varios deportes y adem\u00e1s tienen la oportunidad de conocer una cultura ts\u00e1chila que suele contar sus leyendas a los visitantes en medio de una fogata y camping. Santo Domingo que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nSu negocio est\u00e1 establecido en su casa, todos los d\u00edas atiende muchos clientes que acuden al bazar y papeler\u00eda que desde hace 4 a\u00f1os abre las puertas para solventar las necesidades de sus vecinos en cuanto a productos escolares, suministros de oficina, art\u00edculos de bazar incluido prendas de vestir, siempre atiende al p\u00fablico con mucho cari\u00f1o, respeto y amabilidad. Esta actividad comercial la aprendi\u00f3 gracias a su hermana quien con mucha paciencia otorg\u00f3 a Jenny informaci\u00f3n sobre proveedores, costos, demanda, etc. Le gusta mucho lo que hace ya que as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n puede dedicar su tiempo a m\u00faltiples actividades del hogar, ayudar a sus hijos en las tareas y cuidar a su hijo peque\u00f1o. Ahora tiene muchos planes para su negocio entre ellos ampliar el surtido de productos que ofrece comprando al por mayor \u00fatiles escolares como cuadernos de diferentes tama\u00f1os y modelos, l\u00e1pices, esferos, etc., todo esto con el af\u00e1n de que sus clientes encuentren todo lo que necesitan en esta temporada que los ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes empiezan un nuevo per\u00edodo de clases, para lo cual decidi\u00f3 buscar a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, instituci\u00f3n de la cual recibi\u00f3 muy buenas referencias por los cr\u00e9ditos y apoyo que brindan a microempresarios y emprendedores. Solicita un cr\u00e9dito que le ayudar\u00e1 en este paso de crecimiento laboral, ya que as\u00ed se sentir\u00e1 segura de avanzar con su negocio y sus clientes ser\u00e1n m\u00e1s y por lo tanto sus ingresos  crecer\u00e1n con los cuales podr\u00e1 ofrecer a sus hijo un mejor estilo de vida. Jenny agradece a cada inversionista de Kiva que decida apoyarle e incentiva a seguir aportando a los emprendedores y microempresarios, ya que es la mejor forma de creer en ellos y sus proyectos, lo cual les motiva a seguir luchando por un ma\u00f1ana mejor.","en":"Jenny, 35, has three children, two of whom are studying at the public school and the third still stays home under her care. She is single and works every day to move forward along with her children. Jenny lives with her children in Chig\u00fcilpe parish, 15 minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, the capital city of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. This place has a very active trade since it has become an inland port of exchange between the mountains and the coast of Ecuador. This parish has many homes made of cement and a combination of wood and cement. There is a much-visited river, where the tourists and inhabitants do a lot of sports. They also have the chance to get to know the Ts\u00e1chila culture. Legends are usually told to the visitors during a bonfire and camping. Santo Domingo is the third most populated city in the region. It has activities like agriculture, ranching, fishing, and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nJenny's business is set up in her home. Every day she attends to many customers who come to the bazaar and stationery store that she opened four years ago in order to meet her neighbors needs for school supplies, office supplies, and bazaar goods including articles of clothing. She always attends to the public with a lot of affection, respect, and friendliness. She learned about this commercial activity thanks to her sister, who very patiently gave Jenny information about providers, costs, demand, etc. She really likes what she does since she can also spend her time to several activities in the home, help her children with their homework, and care for her young child. Now she has many plans for her business, among them increasing the number of products that she offers, buying school supplies like notebooks in different sizes and models, pencils, and pens wholesale. This is all so that her customers find every thing that they need at this time of year when children and young people are starting classes again. This is why she decided to seek out Fundaci\u00f3n Alternatica, an institution for which she received good references because of the loans and help that they give to micro-business owners and entrepreneurs. She is asking for a loan which will help her in this stage of business growth, since this way she will feel confident in moving forward with her business and she will have more customers. Because of this, her income will increase, and she will be able to offer her children a better lifestyle. \r\n\r\nJenny thanks each Kiva lender that decides to support her and encourages them to continue contributing to entrepreneurs and micro-business owners, since it is the best way to believe in them and their projects, which motivates them to keep fighting for a better tomorrow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1397873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Linda is a farmer, and she has two hectares of land. She mainly plants plantains, but she complements this with other crops such as cacao and cocona. She harvests the plantains periodically to sell by the bunch wholesale in the most nearby markets. Because her land is so far away, she can't stay there permanently without moving. This is why she spends long days away from her home until she gets a good product that she harvests with great care, with the help of her husband and one other worker. She also raises animals to sell such as birds and pigs. She likes her work; she has years of experience in this business, and this has allowed her to support her family. She also says that she likes life on the farm, where she feels most peaceful and can put into practice everything she learned from her parents, who were also farmers. On the other hand, her goals are to continue growing and to increase the amount of land she has for planting plantains. For this opportunity, she is requesting S\/. 4,000. She is happy with the financial support given so that she can move forward with her work. She promises to make her payments on time. She will invest the money in purchasing organic compost and hiring more workers for harvest time.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1398095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase organic compost and hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Aucayacu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-07-28T20:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-27T20:10:01Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":944.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":982.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1020.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1052.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":381.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":342.2,"local_amount":944.01,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":951.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865058},{"amount":356.31,"local_amount":982.92,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":990.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353424},{"amount":370.1,"local_amount":1020.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1029.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905188},{"amount":381.39,"local_amount":1052.12,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-07T10:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091183}],"funded_date":"2013-07-29T01:24:36Z","paid_date":"2014-01-07T10:20:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Olivia Shirley","image":836829}},{"id":587503,"name":"Lena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lena is a married, 28-year-old mother of two in Mwingi.

She is a young businessperson and is in a common-law marriage with Cristian, 19, who is a young professional driver and works for a taxi company. They have a small child and live together in the Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n parish in Santo Domingo, the capital city of the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Commerce is quite strong in the area, since it is a land port of exchange between the mountains and the coast of Ecuador. Visits from local and international tourists strengthen the local businesses, which have recently grown up all around the city. This is the third-most inhabited city in the region. The residents also work in areas such as agriculture, livestock, fishing, and manufacturing.\r\nYexi opened a beauty salon three years ago. She specialized in this art in high school, and enjoys it greatly. She is constantly honing her skills through courses at various beauty centres. She works twelve hours a day, every day, including weekends. She rests when there is lower demand for her services. Her dream is to be able to expand her beauty salon with spa services in order to be able to provide work for other people. \r\nYexi is requesting a loan which she will use to purchase adequate furniture for her business. She will buy chairs, both to provide her clients with comfort and to allow her to work comfortably. She will also buy chairs for children and furniture for the waiting room. Her clientele grows every day; she expands her business every day for the sake of her family's well-being. Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa opened its doors to her so that she could make this needed change to her

Her method of sales is door to door. She works every day, mostly in the morning hours because those hours are the easiest for her routes because her children are in school. She only has to bring the youngest child with her. She sells on credit and is paid on a weekly basis. She has been doing this work for 6 years.

Liana graduated from pharmaceutical college and works as a pharmacist at a local pharmacy as well as, at the same time, a nurse at a local hospital. Unfortunately, she is the only person working in the family and her salary is not enough to make ends meet for a family of four. \r\n\r\nIn the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living. So, she decided to start her own business with a loan. However, the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  Liana\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received credit through the joint initiative, the Kiva and Credo-Startup Program, which gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of 1,500 GEL, she will purchase beehives with bee-colonies. The family will start producing honey and will be able to increase its income. The Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased.

His dream is to generate more earnings so he can remodel his home and through this provide a better quality of life to his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":1398159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer to cultivate corn.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2013-07-28T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-27T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":4050,"lender_count":137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estanislao","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro Isidro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bacilio Anastacio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obispo Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirila Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luc\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":31500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":31500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.15,"local_amount":553.42,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":556.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429993976},{"amount":69.71,"local_amount":542.19,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T09:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":544.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449534632},{"amount":251.8,"local_amount":1958.47,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T08:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1968.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468139797},{"amount":930.81,"local_amount":7239.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-19T09:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":7276.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504156939},{"amount":2726.53,"local_amount":21206.25,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":21314.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517440442}],"funded_date":"2013-08-10T09:27:33Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T08:32:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Hildreth","image":null}},{"id":587552,"name":"Isaac","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isaac lives in the Litein area of eastern Kenya, a very productive area for agriculture.

In 2004, after losing her husband, she decided to open her own business selling meals. Food that she makes herself, such as tamales, blood sausage, Spanish sausage, arepas with shredded meat (a stuffed flat corn flour traditional food) amongst others. She started her business because she wanted to feel useful but at her age jobs are hard to come by. At the present her business is growing thanks to Oliva's energy, dedication and determination. She labors daily with enthusiasm and a spirit of getting ahead, without forgetting what is most important, her family. \r\n\r\nIn this way Olivia has managed to earn the money to support her household and is motivated to ask for another loan to support the growth of her business. She will use the loan to buy fixed assets (pots, dishes, cooking utensils) as well as purchasing pop and beer wholesale. Her goal is to offer her customers excellent service and to have the products on hand to satisfy the demands of her clientele. This will help her increase her sales and be more competitive in her market. Thus advancing step by step towards her dream, which is to have a nice business with a country style, inside the city.

Lacking employment opportunity, he decided to open a business to earn a living. He has been a street merchant for 10 years, and his target market depends on events, concerts, and other activities held in the city. He uses a hand-push cart to haul his portable polystyrene containers and sell sodas, canned beer, and liquor. He has managed to earn enough to support his family, give his son a basic education, and pay monthly bills. \r\n\r\nIgnacio is hardworking, active, and always positive about life. He strives to get ahead along with his family and face bad weather, which has become his major challenge. Despite everything, he always looks for chances to succeed, so he has applied for his second loan cycle. He will use the loan to buy wholesale merchandise (sodas, beer, and alcohol) and to buy polystyrene containers to replace worn ones so that he can continue with this job, which has gotten him through tough times over the years. Ignacio dreams of opening his own liquor store, where he would be more comfortable and safer, and which would let him earn more so that he can ensure that his son has the chance for a better education and that his family has a better standard of living.

She lives in the Zestaponi District in Georgia with her large family: her husband, son, daughter-in-law, infant grandson, retired parents-in-law and a brother-in-law. \r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because of low income and the family's poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe source of income for the family is an agricultural business. They have 7 cows and produce cheese which is sold locally. Besides that, the family cultivates a plot of land where nuts are grown. They own a vineyard as well. The harvested products are sold at the local open market, but the income is hardly enough for food and every day expenses for an eight-person family. \r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo, Kiva's field partner, to start up a family business and build a greenhouse. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to vulnurable poor, who do not have access to credit products, as they're regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Nino will purchase all the building materials for the greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built properly, Nino will grow greens and various types of vegetables. The harvested products will be sold for a good price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income and all members will improve their living

The members of the bank do different types of work such as selling clothing, vegetables, shower curtains, and cushions. Mar\u00eda has a business making and selling shower curtains, school uniforms, cushions, and tablecloths. She learned the work at a technical high school, from which she graduated approximately 30 years ago, and she has also worked at different tailoring businesses. What has given her business the most trouble is the lack of money to keep it going. She hopes to be able to use the loan to buy supplies for her work, which are thread, fabric, and lace. She hopes that it goes very well for her, since despite not having money to buy the supplies, many people have ordered from her and she is only waiting to have the money to start.

He sells cleaning supplies from door to door and also grows sweetcorn. He has been doing both for ten years. His sweetcorn field has a surface of 10,500 square metres. The harvest feeds the family, with the surplus being sold to neighbours and friends. Marcos tills the land with the help of his son: together, they take care of the harvest and do their best to have as productive a farm as possible. The loan Marcos asks for will be used to to buy fertiliser, pesticides, and herbicides for the last harvest of the season. He and his son will thus be able to cultivate the land for one more year. They hope for a clement winter in order to be able to harvest properly and generate enough income to pay for household expenses. Without the loan, Marcos would have had to sow a smaller area, or even not at all. His goals for the future are to take out a more substantial loan in order to improve his house and his family's living

He lives in Parcona, a place known for its all-year-round warm climate, its cotton fields, its vineyards, and its spice-growing industry. In his spare time, Pedro loves to go for a stroll with his wife, the perfect way, he says, to forget about your problems. He sometimes asks his wife to make him one of his favourites dishes, ceviche (raw fish marinated in lemon). Owing to scarce financial resources, Pedro completed only secondary education, but he would have liked to study electronics. Pedro works day in, day out as a taxi driver, as do many of his compatriots. He works about ten hours a day and can have as many as 40 customers in one day. He attributes his success to his amiability towards customers and to his natural charisma. Pedro is very grateful to Kiva lenders since this is the second time that they help him. Thanks to this loan, he will be able to buy merchandise, such as pasta, sugar, and tuna, in order to start a new business, namely, a grocery shop. He hopes this will generate more income, which would really come in handy for household expenses. His wish is to keep working and fighting every day to make his greatest dream come true: \"I want to have a better life\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1398796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise in order to start a new business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T09:00:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":136.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":142.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":154.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":162.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":174.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":185.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":189.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":198.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":205.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.88,"local_amount":270,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":271.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779397},{"amount":51.51,"local_amount":142.12,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":143.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054595},{"amount":110.41,"local_amount":304.57,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":306.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819493},{"amount":58.92,"local_amount":162.55,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":163.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694910},{"amount":124.03,"local_amount":342.16,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":344.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450390944},{"amount":67.1,"local_amount":185.08,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":186.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880363},{"amount":68.73,"local_amount":189.61,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":191.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479103925},{"amount":146.42,"local_amount":403.91,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":406.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490799015}],"funded_date":"2013-08-26T16:46:43Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:07:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":589094,"name":"Arcadio Jos\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Arcadio, a sus 47 a\u00f1os de edad es padre de 3 hijos y est\u00e1 separado, ya que su pareja lo abandon\u00f3, dej\u00e1ndolo a cargo de sus hijos.

He is married and has one child, aged four. In 2010, Abu Bakarr established his DVD, VCD, and recharging cards business. He began his business after dropping out of school to be self reliant. His business is located in the city center and his main customers are adults. Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, he earns about 1,100,000 SLL every month from this business.

Her children are all grown up and self-sufficient. Shaken has a secondary education. She is composed, level-headed and hard working by nature. For the primary source of income for her family, Shaken has practiced animal husbandry for many years now, starting her business with 25,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Shaken has on her farm: 5 milk cows, 3 calves, 15 sheep, and also has a 1.72 hectare plot of land on which she grows clover. Her business brings in about 20,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk, dairy products, eggs, and chickens, which serves to cover the cost of food and daily living needs for her family. Remittances from Russia, where Shaken's son and  daughter-in-law earn a living, serve as additional income. The profits from Shaken's agricultural business allowed her to marry off her children and help them start their households. For the purpose of the further development of her business, Shaken turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy bulls and sheep. Shaken plans to invest the earnings from this loan in the further expansion of her farm and she would also like to repair her house in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1395376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She also sold them in the nearest town market, which is about 8 kms away from the village. She used to purchase used clothes from the city market and sell them. The profit was sufficient to manage daily expenses with a monthly savings. She started feeling chest pain after frequently traveling to make sales. She quit her used clothes selling business and decided to start a poultry business to generate income.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Hoikholhing is planning to purchase 50 to 60 chicks in different breeds, raise them and sell them when they are fully grown. She will vaccinate and raise them with nutritional chicken feeds. There are women market vendors who sell poultry in the town market and in the city market.

That way her health will be improved and subsequently she will generate income for the family. \r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS for this opportunity and says the essential, most requisite -- i.e. capital money -- will be provided by the esteemed Kiva via WSDS.

The inability to continue studies during childhood days and poor financial conditions of the family is still taking its toil. It left Neikhol with very few options to generate income for the family. \r\n\r\nNeikhol is the featured borrower member for \"Chullou Lom\" Group. She is pictured on the extreme left with hand raised. All group members reside in a village that is about 40 kms on the southern side of the state in Manipur. Manipur is one the northeastern states of India.\r\n \r\nNeikhol grows chives as her main produce in the fields. Chives grow fast and they are ready to be sold in three months. Chives are easy to sell as they can be prepared in various ways. She also sells other fresh vegetables in accordance with the season and the demands. She sells mustard, pumpkins, bean sprouts, bay leaves, lady's finger, pea-shoots, yams, etc. She gets the vegetables from the fields at dawn, goes to the town market, and spends her whole day selling vegetables. Since the market is on the main National Highway, she manages to sell all her hoardings for a day. Customers throng in from all the nearby villages, and travelers and passersby also drop in to purchase vegetables. \r\n\r\nThe town market is popularly known for reasonable rates and quality. Neikhol says she is lucky to have a place in the town market because this market is the main reason why she is able to supplement and manage the family expenses. \r\n\r\nThe unavailability of capital money paralyses most of her ideas and plans to make a better livelihood  But she says she wanted to generate income by selling pigs, and she used her savings to purchase those piglets and she raises them at the back of her house.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase seeds and saplings of Rabi crops to grow. (Rabi crops are sewn in winter and harvested in spring.) She will purchase saplings of cabbage, cauliflower, broad beans, peas and pea-shoots, garlic, onions, spring onions, chives, broccoli and more.\r\n\r\nShe says she will continue growing vegetables and selling them for profits. She will take rest only when her children can take care of the family affairs. She thanked Kiva and WSDS for the absolute financial assistance for an underserved vendor like her, which paves the way for her to continue and promote better means to generate income. She asks Kiva to continue helping her in the future and also says, \u201cKiva work is very motivational and inspirational. Thank you, Kiva.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in growing chives and selling them in the town market.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1390623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more Rabi crops to grow and sell  for profits.

They do not have children yet.  His business involves making plastic bags which he sells at stores in different neighborhoods in Barranquilla, at the city's central market, and at stores in the towns of Soledad and Sabanagrande.   He buys the polyethylene he uses to make the bags in cash and sells the bags on credit.  He went out on his own six years ago, but learned the business thirteen years ago, when he was ten, from his father.  He started out helping his father make bags and distribute them to stores and businesses that asked for them.  When his father reached an advanced age, he gave the entire business to Juan.  This is Juan's first Kiva loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and he'll use it to buy polyethylene for making the plastic bags.  He hopes to buy at lower prices so he can offer better prices to his customers and keep them loyal to his business.

Three of her children are grown and independent, and Kenjekan's daughter, who attends 10th grade, lives with her.  Kenjekan has a higher education.  She has been working the night shift at the hospital for 32 years and is very well liked by her colleagues.  They says that she is a kind and hardworking woman.  To provide an additional source of income for her family, Kenjekan got involved in animal husbandry and farming in 2008, having started this business with 50,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistent and diligent work, Kenjekan's business contains 3 horses, 4 cows, 15 sheep, and also a land plot of 1.20 hectares, where she plants clover, beans and strawberries.  Her business yields about 12,000 som (KGS) per month.  The profits from the business allowed Kenjekan to marry off her children and provide for them.  In order to further develop her business, Kenjekan requested a loan in the amount of 125,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a horse.  Kenjekan plans to invest the earnings from the loan in a continued increase of her business, and also wants to give her daughter a decent education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1395402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is from Liberia and lives in the Caldwell area of Montserrado County. This area is coming to be one of the more populated communities in Montserrado, due to some options like good roads, quiet, and lower house rental prices. \r\n       \r\nRuth is 32 years old and she completed 12th grade. She is married to a driver and they have a one-year-old child who is always with Ruth. Ruth is presently selling rubber dishes, such as cups, plates, spoons and bowls, and is also selling lappa (a traditional cloth mostly used in Africa by women). She started in business by selling frozen food seven years ago with a little money from her mother. She learned this way of selling from her friends.\r\n\r\nRuth received a loan of twenty thousand Liberian Dollars to buy more rubber dishes and lappa to increase her sales. She complains that the rainy season is the biggest challenge she faces since she does not have a shop. She admires her business because it makes her independent, and she is so proud of her business because from there she handles her own money. Her dream is to live a better life in the future, and hopes that one day her child will become president. She thanks the lenders for their support.   \r\n

sons and a daughter) and her retired mother. Unfortunately her husband died several years ago, and after this loss Shushanik\u2019s family became very upset and for a long time her children could not realize what had happened and why their usual life became so sad and colorless. However, we all know that whatever happens, independent of us, time heals. \r\n\r\nBefore her husband died, Shushanik had never worked anywhere, but soon it was necessary to find some work. Today she works as a cook at one of the very famous and dainty restaurants of our city. Shushanik is doing her best to provide her family with normal living conditions.

He is now going through the big hurdle of the separation from his life partner.  They had three children, ages 9, 7, and 11 months.  Roddy has an elementary school education.  With that knowledge he has worked as a bricklayer since he was very young.  He has worked on various constructions with the objective of his children not having to do without anything.\r\n\r\nRoddy lives in the R\u00edo Verde parish in the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province.  It is an inland port that moves Ecuadorian commerce upon joining the mountainous and coastal regions of this country.  Its climate is humid, and the temperature favors agricultural and livestock business activities.  Commerce has also grown, supporting the economic development in the area.\r\n\r\nIn this place several young entrepreneurs have emerged, and they have taken advantage of the opportunities that their city offers in order to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is the case with Roddy, a bricklayer.  Three years ago he undertook the business of raising chickens and pigs to later sell.  He learned this business activity as a boy by his father\u2019s example and teachings.  He father also raises animals.  Roddy spends three times a week on this business activity so that he does not neglect any possible construction jobs that he is hired for.  Nevertheless, on the days that he cannot tend to the animals he pays a person to feed and take care of the animals.\r\n\r\nRoddy has been able to recapitalize his earnings by purchasing more chickens and pigs.  However, he needs more feed to maintain the animals.  That is why he is requesting a loan to be able to buy large quantities of grains for the pigs and balanced feed for the chickens.  This way he will be able to keep his animals well-fed and healthy.  This way Roddy will be able to offer his customers guaranteed product, and he will have adequate control of the quality, which this business demands.  \r\n\r\nRoddy dreams are to grow with his business and to one day see his children become excellent professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1398853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy feed for his pigs and chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roddy Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1060.54,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":158.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":172.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":176.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":180.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":184.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":187.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.03},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":161.03,"local_amount":158.86,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":161.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814479},{"amount":174.94,"local_amount":172.59,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":174.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320650},{"amount":179.22,"local_amount":176.81,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":179.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856338},{"amount":186.21,"local_amount":183.71,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":186.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059916},{"amount":189.87,"local_amount":187.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":189.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995249},{"amount":183.73,"local_amount":181.25,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":183.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413687}],"funded_date":"2013-08-25T00:26:23Z","paid_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":587728,"name":"Florita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florita is fish vendor from the town of Panglao, Bohol.
