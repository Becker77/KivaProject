She is married and has two children, ages 20 and 14, and only the young one stays at home and attends school. Her husband is a local businessman. She has been running a table business in the Caldwell market from which she sells rice, pepper, soap and oil, etc.  She is asking for a loan to buy enough rice, pepper, soap, oil, etc. to increase her sales. She complains that the lack of stable prices is the major problem she faces now. \r\n\r\nShe started this business with a little money from her husband fifteen years ago, by selling cookies in her community. She enjoys her business because she earns her own money, and she is so proud of her business because it makes her independent. Her plans are to one day own a house, and to see her children attending university in the near future. She appreciates the supporters of BRAC. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1396528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Beatriz vive con su familia en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un puerto terrestre que moviliza el comercio ecuatoriano al unir las Regiones Sierra y Costa de ese pa\u00eds. Su clima es h\u00famedo y la temperatura favorece a las actividades agr\u00edcolas y ganaderas. El comercio tambi\u00e9n ha crecido aportando al desarrollo econ\u00f3mico de la zona.

The knowledge which she gained in primary school did not open many doors for her in the labor market. Nevertheless, she dedicated herself to the household duties for a long time. She is married to Segundo, 46, a hardworking man who is a professional taxi driver in the city. He and Beatriz have one son, who is in a state school. They hope that one day he will become a professional who contributes to the country's improvement. \r\n\r\nBeatriz lives with her family in the parish of R\u00edo Verde in the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a terrestrial port which mobilizes trade between the Sierra and Costa regions of Ecuador. Its climate is humid and favorable for agriculture and livestock. Trade has also grown, bringing economic development to the region. \r\n\r\nIn this area, various young entrepreneurs have taken advantage of the opportunities which their city offers for success, such as Beatriz. Some time ago, she decided to help with the household expenses to improve her family's quality of life. She sells cosmetics as a traveling saleswoman, traveling through the city's long streets to offer her products for sale. She makes deliveries and takes payments from her clients, who are mostly women. \r\n\r\nBeatriz has applied for a loan to buy some of the most popular products, using offers which her suppliers offer her. She will then be able to keep products in stock and satisfy the needs of her most demanding clients. She hopes to improve her earnings so that she can cover some of her household expenses and give her son a comfortable life and education.\r\n\r\nBeatriz has joined up with two of her friends, Ang\u00e9lica and Decci, who are also small business owners.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica, 33, is married and also sells cosmetics. She will invest in merchandise which will increase her income, so that she can give her two children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nDecci, 34, is married with three children. She will invest her part of the loan in the purchase of chickens and feed. She makes a living raising chickens to sell.\r\n\r\nThese three women joined up with one goal in common: to give up all pretexts about a lack of work and grow in their businesses to show everyone that it is possible to succeed by putting in effort and working hard."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1398965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy products to keep her business stocked.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Gricelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Decci Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2062.44,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":228.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":242.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":253.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":255.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":260.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":268.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":272.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":280.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":346.22,"local_amount":344.12,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":346.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814480},{"amount":260.99,"local_amount":259.41,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":260.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320651},{"amount":129.43,"local_amount":128.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":129.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856339},{"amount":259.79,"local_amount":258.22,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":259.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059917},{"amount":267.77,"local_amount":266.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":267.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995250},{"amount":499.16,"local_amount":496.14,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":499.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413688},{"amount":311.64,"local_amount":309.75,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":311.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102330}],"funded_date":"2013-08-26T20:44:11Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":587779,"name":"Lasha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lasha is 20-year-old student from the small town of Jinvali.

They perfectly manage to sell products of their farm, including dairy products, eggs and fruits. With the income earned by farming, Artak has already bought some furniture for the house.\r\n\r\nNow Artak wants to start a beekeeping business. Therefore, he asks for a loan, with which he will buy ten bee hives and some animal fodder.

27, Darius is the bread-winner for his family. He supports them with the profits he earns from his Zoona mobile money transfer business, located in Mazabuka town of Zambia.\r\n\r\nDarius is taking out a Kiva loan, so that he can increase his working capital float, which will help him to grow his business because he will be able to serve a lot more customers wanting to send and receive money from his shop.  \r\n\r\nDarius explained that Mazabuka is a fast-growing town and his business has grown from the time he started. The growth has meant that a lot of people now know his shop and he is failing to meet their demand to process money transfer transactions.

She is married with two children. One of her children is going to school.  In 2005, Fatmata established her palm oil business. She began her business because she needs to generate income to take care of herself and her family. She works at the business every day from morning to night.  She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase palm oil, gari and general stock. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and repay her loan. In the future, she plans to see her business to a higher level.

livestock. Ranogul has taught kindergarten for more than seven years. She loves her job and intends to continue to work at the school for many years. Her husband is a high-school teacher and earns a small salary. Ranogul and her husband are raising five children.

Living conditions there are a bit difficult, due to the high rate of crime, fewer bathrooms,  filthy conditions, and over-population, but the most interesting part is that rooms are a bit cheaper, there are options for traveling, it contains one of the biggest markets in Liberia, and prices for food are lower.    \r\n\r\nForty-year-old Cecelia is married. Her husband works as a driver at his office and they both have four children, whose ages are between 22 and 10. Only two of her children are currently attending school and live at home. \r\n\r\nCecelia was unfortunate not to attend school, but she was busy running her shop which sells charcoal in the market of New Kru Town. With the loan proceeds, she will buy more charcoal for her business. She said, \"besides fewer goods on my table market, I have no other problem for now.\" \r\n\r\nTen years ago, with a little money from her mother, she managed to establish this business and learned by seeing other businesswomen. She stated, \"I enjoy the flow of customers and the fast buying.\"  Her dreams are to move from the charcoal business to a store business and to live a better life in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1396757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

This is 47-year-old Iye from Moriba town, Bo, Southern area, in Freetown. She is married with four children between the ages of 8 years and 18 years. Her children are attending school. Her husband is a driver, so his income is not enough to take care of the home.\r\n\r\nIye runs a cookery business; she sells cooked rice, fried fish and cool drinks. She has been running this business for 15 years. She wake up 4:30 a.m. to prepare her cookery business, and she will not rest until the food is finished. One of her daughters usually helps her to run the cookery business. Her business is the only source of income she has. Iye describes her major hardship as sometimes it is very difficult to prepare the cooked food.  \r\n\r\nIye has requested a loan in order to purchase cooking items, including bags of rice, coconut oil and pure water. The extra income from this loan will allow her to change her cookery structure and pay her children\u2019s school fees. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to have her own residence. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1396776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Since 2008, she has made a living with her own business, a grocery store where she sells dairy products, meat, cookies, and cakes, among other products. This has allowed her to provide for her household. \r\n\r\nMary has gone through very difficult times, as she was a victim of a tragedy in her region in 2010 when a landslide brought on by strong rains took away everything she had worked so hard to build. However, with her positive attitude and her spirit to overcome, she has managed to move forward alongside her son and her parents. With plenty of effort, hope, and dedication, she started her business once again, and little by little she has been recuperating the level of sales which she had before the tragedy. Due to the landslide, the region's inhabitants were forced to move and sales fell abruptly during that time. \r\n\r\nMary has applied for a loan to invest in the purchase of wholesale stock (cakes, cookies, dairy products, and others) to take advantage of discounts which have been offered to her. She will then be able to have a better profit when she makes sales, which will allow her to continue providing for her household. She will make one more step towards fulfilling her greatest dream, which is to convert her business into a well-known mini supermarket which is often visited by customers. She will then have the ability to provide her family with better well-being and to give her son an excellent

She has a high-school education and works in the local post-office. Her spouse helps around the house. Zamira has bred cattle since 1998 when she began her business with 20,000 som. The farm consists of one milk cow, three calves, and 1.5 hectares of land for planting cabbage and tomatoes. She earns 10,000 som per month from her livestock and crops. She receives additional income from her eldest daughter who lives and works in Russia. Zamira would like to own more livestock, so she asked the microfinance institution Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som in order to buy cows and fertilizers. With the proceeds from the loan, Zamira wants to continue to raise cattle and grow crops.

Four of her children are attending school. \r\n\r\nMonica runs a cookery business; she sells cooked rice, fried fish, and cool drinks. She has been running this business for 20 years. She wakes up 4:30 am to prepare her cookery business and she will not rest until the food is finished. One of her daughters usually helps her run the cookery business. Her business is the only source of income she has. Monica's major hardship is that sometimes preparing the cookery is very difficult.  \r\n\r\nMonica has requested a loan in order to purchase cooking item including bagged rice, coconut oil, soft drinks, and pure water.  The extra income from this loan will allow her to change her cookery structure and save money to buy a vehicle for her husband. In the future, she plans to have her own residence.

Lily\u2019s passion for fashion led her to establish an online store for women\u2019s clothing four years ago. She also sold at the farmers\u2019 market, and the response was so positive that Lily was inspired to pursue her dream, opening a boutique in San Rafael just last year. Lilyluv Boutique is stocked with trendy, edgy clothing and accessories for young women and is committed to modest pricing, the only store of its kind in Marin County. \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge to opening Lilyluv Boutique was getting funded. Lily used all of her own savings to establish the business. When denied for a conventional bank loan, Lily felt that she was not taken seriously because she is a young woman. The discouragement did not hamper Lily; her determination to prove to herself that she could be successful, as well as a Kiva loan from Working Solutions, propelled her forward. She hopes her boutique inspires other young women to \u201cfollow their dreams, follow their passions\u201d despite the odds against them. \r\n\r\nThis loan will enable Lily to purchase the inventory she needs to grow the boutique and online store, purchase store furniture, and further promote her business. \r\n\r\nFor more information on Lilyluv, visit the website at www.shoplilyluv.com, the

This is made even harder by the fact that there is only one bank in Mwandi village and it takes about 24 hours for him to get his money once he sends it to the bank. This means that he cannot serve as many customers as he would like to. He loses out on profit.\r\n\r\nMark is excited to continue to offer mobile money services to his community. He says the support from Kiva has helped his to start and grow his business and improve his quality of life. His daughter is now in grade eight at a good boarding school and he is able to pay school fees from his Zoona money transfer profits. He would like to thank Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":1396745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To grow his Zoona business by increasing his working capital float so that he can serve more customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Mwandi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T20:40:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T20:40:24Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":370.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":11000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1654.89,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2015-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":11117.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":370.11,"payment_id":636777307}],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T00:58:18Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T13:04:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Kuperberg","image":null}},{"id":587124,"name":"Usmonjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0423\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d 26-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0412\u0430\u0445\u0434\u0430\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u0423\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u044d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0438\u043c\u0447\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a. \u041e\u043d \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 3-\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0423\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u044b \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 2700 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 \u0432 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442. \u0423\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.

and two daughters.  Her spouse and children help her with her farm.  Gulnara has worked with livestock and in agriculture since 2004, having started her business with 20,000 KGS.  Her monthly profits are 8,000 KGS.  To date she has been able to expand her farming activities, she has her own plot of land (2.80 hectares) where she grows peppers, corn and cabbage.  She also has two dairy cows, two calves and 250 sheep.  With the goal of further developing her farming, Gulnara turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushuma and Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS to buy a calf and fertilizer.  She plans to use the income from the loan to increase her herd of cattle and improve her family's well-being.

He is a modest, hardworking person who is engaged in the cultivation of corn, beans, and sorghum.  He learned this work at an early age from his father.  Since he is the eldest of his brothers, he recalls that his father bought him a \u201ccuma\u2019 [curved knife] to carry and taught him how to clear the cornfield. Rising early and working all day, he didn\u2019t have the opportunity to study until he was fourteen years old and they sent him to school where he learned to read and write.  Later, he decided to start his own family and has been cultivating basic grains and fattening Creole pigs to make a living and pay for other necessities. Nowadays, he is teaching his son how to cultivate so that he can develop job skills in the future and give him space to study and develop other skills.\r\n\r\nHe purchases his supplies at a place that gives him better prices and the quality products that he needs for growing such as seeds, fertilizer, and poisons to control pests and diseases in his crops.  In this way, he can plant a good cornfield and yield good production at the harvest.  In addition, he has to travel 15 kilometers in his \u201cpick-up\u201d to get to the place where his customers find the products they need.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to purchase twelve bags of sulfate, and sorghum for planting.  He will also buy products such as fungicides, insecticides to control pests and diseases, and herbicides for weed control in crops. In addition, he will use a portion of the funds to pay people that help him with land preparation, sowing, and fertilizing planted crops.\r\n\r\nThis investment will help the client purchase agricultural inputs and so, cultivate basic grains for his family\u2019s consumption.  He will also be able to dedicate himself to his crops as he has done since childhood, and in this way, generate income for his family.  Last year, he had problems with his harvest because he didn\u2019t have money to take care of his crops.  However, thanks to the support that Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is offering him today, he will be able to sow his basic grains and give them the necessary attention to obtain a better production. In this way, he will have food for his family as well as income to pay for the needs of his wife and children.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that after paying off this loan, he will take out another one and allocate it to purchase cattle (heifers), fatten them up and have them impregnated, and later sell them. In this way, he will be able to generate more income to pay for his household needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1398929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sulfate, sorghum, fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, and pay laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Aguedo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818155}],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T18:18:03Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Francoletti-Putz","image":null}},{"id":588034,"name":"Malaeolema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Malaeolema is a 66-year-old married woman with 11 children.

She's married and has two children with whom she lives in an adobe house. Virginia owns a grocery store which she set up on the ground floor of her house. She set it up four years ago with the goal of helping her husband support their family's finances. At first she bought very little merchandise to give it a try, and soon she saw the good results she was getting and bought much more products. She reports that the products that are in highest demand are rice, sugar, milk, oats and other cereals. She also sells cell phone recharges as well as fruits from that area in order to obtain additional profits. She feels very comfortable with her work because it also helped her to become a very well-known neighbor and make several friends. However, occasionaly there are customers who ask for merchandise on credit and take too long to pay her, resulting in some losses for her. In time she wishes to improve her business even more and eventually become a wholesale seller, so that she can improve her profits and also her finances. This is her third Kiva loan and she feels grateful for the financial support she's receiving so she can get ahead. In addition, she pledges to make her repayments in a timely fashion. On this occasion she wishes to get 3,000 nuevos soles in order to stock her business with products such as eggs, sacks of rice, sacks of sugar and vegetables."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1399749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase foodstuffs such as eggs, rice, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-07-30T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-29T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":464.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":479.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":478.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":511.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":527.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":538.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":346.13,"local_amount":943.98,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":965.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865064},{"amount":175.32,"local_amount":478.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":488.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353430},{"amount":187.42,"local_amount":511.15,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":522.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905194},{"amount":193.59,"local_amount":527.97,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":539.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091189},{"amount":197.54,"local_amount":538.75,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":550.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777792}],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T14:00:16Z","paid_date":"2014-01-29T09:42:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":587273,"name":"Irma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irma is a Kubo Financiero client and this is her story:\n\nI am Irma, I am 43 years old.

She is single, and her 2-year-old son is the motivation to make an effort every day for a better lifestyle, since she dreams of being able to have her own house and live comfortably there with her little one. Sandra has received the help of her son's grandparents and lives with them and her son in Quito, the capital city of the Republic of Ecuador, specifically in the southern sector of the city where business is very active.\r\n\r\nSandra, with her mother as her guide, learned the art of cooking from the time she was very young. She makes some delicious typical dishes and, of course, dishes a la carte. Two years ago, with the birth of her son, she saw the need to take advantage of this skill in the kitchen, and she started a restaurant in a small building. She offers breakfast, lunch, and dishes a la carte as well as special dishes such as \"pinchos\" (kebabs), \"tripos asadas\" (grilled tripe), and \"encebollados de pescado\" (a soup made with onion and tuna). Sandra decided to start this business when, after looking for a long time for work that would sustain her and her son, she found all the doors closed, since she only studied through primary school and that was not sufficient anywhere.\r\n\r\nNow Sandra takes advantage of the knowledge acquired from her mother and at school to manage her restaurant, where she personally takes charge of the food preparation and the customer service. She invests at least 6 hours every day from Tuesday through Sunday. She shares her free time with her son and also looks to amuse herself by doing some sewing work.\r\n\r\nSandra is asking for the loan in order to be able to make repairs to the restaurant's infrastructure, since it needs some decorations and implements that would give the place an ambience in which her customers could feel comfortable and that would also draw attention when people pass by. She is sure that with this loan her customers will increase and therefore her profits will be greater, which will help her to cover the household expenses and also to give her son a quality

Mar\u00eda also sells \u201cmapahuira\u201d (the pieces of fat that are rendered after frying pork), which is a popular afternoon snack.

She has four sons and three daughters. Her two sons are doing jobs as motor mechanics on daily wages. The condition of her house is not good, and the living standard of her family is miserable.\r\n\r\nSaima requested a loan of 35,000 Pakistani rupees for her husband. Her husband owns a spare parts shop in which he sells motorbike spare parts such as silencers, fuel tanks, foot rests, wheels, tires, tubes, etc. Her husband also supplies spare parts to other shopkeepers with his rickshaw. Nowadays, his auto rickshaw is out of order due to overloading. Its engine needs some maintenance. Through this loan, her husband can easily fix the problem with his auto rickshaw. Saima hopes that one day the miserable condition of her family will change.\r\n\r\nSaima is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC

Es una persona que se ha dedicado a ser agricultor desde que tenia aproximadamente10 a\u00f1os, ya que sus padres no pose\u00edan los recursos necesarios para brindarle el estudio, tuvo que aprender el trabajo. \u00c9l recuerda, cuando su padre una persona que fue agricultor toda su vida,  lo llevaba al terreno donde ten\u00edan la milpa para que le ayudara a trabajar, y as\u00ed fue como aprendi\u00f3 a conocer cuales son los cuidados y las labores que se le realizan al cultivo de ma\u00edz. Jos\u00e9,  es un agricultor con mucha experiencia, trabajador y sobre todo una persona honesta y con deseos de superaci\u00f3n.\n\n Vive aproximadamente a cuatro km de distancia de la carretera litoral. Por lo cual hace un gran esfuerzo cuando le toca salir a comprar los insumos que necesita para el cultivo, puesto que le toca que caminar esa distancia, ya que no existe transporte fijo en la comunidad donde vive. De ah\u00ed, viaja en bus hasta la ciudad a comprar todo lo que utilizara para la siembra. Y tiene que hacer el mismo recorrido hasta su casa, ya esta vez le toca que pagar un carro para que pueda llevarlo, ya que no podr\u00eda con la carga de todos los insumos.\n\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar semilla, fertilizantes, herbicidas para control de malezas y plaguicidas para controlar de manera preventiva el ataque de plagas y sembrar 14,000 metros cuadrados de ma\u00edz. \n\n\nLa inversi\u00f3n, le ayudara grandemente, debido a que cultivara y tendr\u00e1 para consumo personal y de su familia y con  el resto espera obtener ingresos con la venta de ma\u00edz y as\u00ed cancelar el pr\u00e9stamo y a la vez seguir teniendo la puerta abierta de futuros prestamos en la fundaci\u00f3n. \n\n\n\u00c9l tiene pensado si Dios le presta vida, seguir con la siembra de ma\u00edz. Pero quisiera  sembrar en mayores cantidades de terreno, con lo que tiene pensado en un futuro poder optar a nuevos prestamos para comprar 7,000 metros cuadrados de terreno.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 44 years old, married, and has 4 children. He has been farming since he was 10 years old, as his parents didn't have the necessary resources to provide him an education, he had to learn how to work. He remembers, when his father who was a farmer all his life, would take him to the field where he was planting so that Jos\u00e9 could help him work, and in this way he learned which where his chores and tasks to do to grow the corn. Jos\u00e9 is a very experienced, hard-working, and above all honest person with desires to succeed.\r\n\r\nHe lives approximately 4 km from the coastal highway. So it takes a great effort when he has to go buy the items he needs to farm, as he has to walk this distance as there isn't regular transportation in the community where he lives.

He has to do this same trip back to his home, but this time he has to pay for a car to take him as he couldn't otherwise return with all the supplies.\r\n\r\nThe loan he seeks from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy seeds, fertilizers, herbicides to control weeds and insecticides to prevent infestations and plant 14,000 square meters of corn.\r\n\r\nThe investment will greatly help him, as he will plant and will have personal food for his family and with the rest he hopes to have income from the sale of the corn and in this way pay the loan and at the same time continue to have an open door for future loans with the foundation.\r\n\r\nHe believes that if God gives him life, he will continue growing corn. But he would like to plant greater quantities of land, and in the future he hopes to be able to opt for new loans in order to buy 7,000 square meters of land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1399797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds, fertilizers, herbicides to control weeds and insecticides to prevent infestations and plant 14,000 square meters of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-30T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-29T02:30:06Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Avilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903312}],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T23:53:48Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":588071,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yolanda is 47 years old, married and blessed with five children.

He finished his secondary education at a technical school where he learned a lot about industrial mechanics.\r\n\r\nJorge has two children, 23 and 13 years old, from a marriage he had for many years, but because of adverse circumstances, ended and is something he is still trying to get over. Now Jorge lives with his parents, Jorge and Teresa, 84 and 83 years old, respectively. They work as farmers on the land around the home. Jorge lives in Latacunga, a city in the Ecuadorian Sierra that has grown considerably over the past years, as much in infrastructure and population as in economic activities that have strengthened the city's progress.\r\n\r\nSince he was very young, Jorge worked in several shops where he was able to grow his knowledge of industrial mechanics and gain experience in that area. Thanks to the opportunity that his bosses gave him, he grew in this career. Because of this, it has been five years since he opened his shop where he works between eight and 10 hours a day but still does not have enough customers to be able to pay for necessary expenses.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Jorge is working in his shop, he is always looking out for his crops on the land because farming, ranching, and field work are his other favorite activities because he learned them when he was young and has never stopped doing them. For this reason, Jorge is requesting a loan that he has decided to use to purchase cattle to raise and later sell. In this way, he will be able to have additional revenues that will help him pay for household expenses, help his parents with healthcare costs, and also provide his children with what they need to

impedido avanzar laboralmente.\nSin embargo ahora ella lucha por sus 3 hijas de 29, 27 y 17 a\u00f1os, a quienes ha sostenido con la ayuda de sus padres. Mar\u00eda es una mujer de campo, desde peque\u00f1a aprendi\u00f3 las labores de agricultura y ganader\u00eda  junto a sus padres, en sus tiempos libres ella disfruta mucho sembrar hortalizas, tejer y caminar por la finca.

She could only attend primary school, which has become an obstacle for her to find better job opportunities. However, she fights for her three daughters, who are 29, 27 and 17 years old. She has provided for them with the help of her parents.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a countrywoman. She learned to work in agriculture and cattle raising when she was a small girl, together with her parents. During her free time, she enjoys growing vegetables, weaving and walking around her farm. She lives together with her daughters and her parents Crist\u00f3bal, 78, and Josefina, 79, in Los Bancos, a canton located in the province of Pichincha, one of the largest provinces of the Republic of Ecuador. This canton is located close to Quito and has many forests. Its neighborhoods are inhabited by kind people with their original traditions. Mar\u00eda and her family live far from the town, in a farm that is also their workplace.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda started a livestock business right when her first daughter was born, i.e. 29 years ago. She works at least 12 hours every day cleaning, feeding and milking her cows. She also purifies the milk and makes products such as homemade yogurt, cottage cheese and sweets. She enjoys working with these activities, even if the weather is not pleasant during the winter time, especially in the early morning when she starts working.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is requesting a loan to buy compost, fertilizers and seeds to improve the pastures, since they were ruined during the winter season and she needs to feed her cows in order to produce good-quality milk and to keep them healthy. This loan will help Mar\u00eda and her family to have a stable economy and work in order to cover their basic needs. Mar\u00eda is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the support and advice they have given her and for letting people from all over the world be part of her progress through Kiva. Mar\u00eda hopes to improve every day in order to be able to pay for some improvements that her farm and her house

luego de terminar la escuela primaria se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar con sus padres en el terreno aprendiendo sobre todo tipo de cultivos. \nEste joven emprendedor vive en Santo Domingo, un puerto importante para el comercio del Ecuador, pues es el lugar en donde se une la Regi\u00f3n Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds, por lo que es justamente aqu\u00ed en donde se intercambian los productos para que vayan a las distintas ciudades. Wilmer est\u00e1 orgulloso de ser nativo de esta ciudad, pues el clima tr\u00f3pico \u2013 h\u00famedo favorece a la agricultura por lo que sus tierras albergan los frutos m\u00e1s exquisitos demandados en todo el mundo. \nSiempre trabajando en fincas grandes, Wilmer adquiri\u00f3 la experiencia suficiente para ser un experto de los \u00e1rboles y tierras, as\u00ed que hace 6 a\u00f1os se independiz\u00f3 y asumi\u00f3 la administraci\u00f3n del terreno de sus padres, trabajo al cual invierte la mayor\u00eda de horas del d\u00eda en las labores que cada cultivo necesita.

He is single and has 2 children. He grew up in the country and after finishing primary school started working with his parents on the land, learning about all types of crops.\r\n \r\nThe young entrepreneur lives in Santo Domingo, an important port of commerce in Ecuador. It is the place where the Coast and Sierra regions meet. That is why it is there that products are traded to go to different cities. Wilmer is proud of being a native of this city. The tropical humid climate favors agriculture and its land grows the most delicious products, demanded around the world. \r\n\r\nAlways working on big farms, Wilmer acquired enough experience to be an expert on trees and soil. So 6 years ago, he went off on his own and began managing his parents' land. He invests most of the hours of his day on the work that each crop needs. He grows passion fruit, plantains, cacao, and other staple products. Nonetheless, Wilmer needs to fertilize the land to be able to plant new products and increase the yield and quality of the existing crops.   To do that, Wilmer is asking for a loan that he will invest totally in buying the fertilizer. \r\n\r\nWilmer is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the trust they have put in them to grow in his work as well as for believing in him and his future projects.  The fact that they are helping him with the loan motivates him to work harder to obtain better results. \r\n\r\nWilmer affirms that the lack of capital has always been a problem and getting financing hasn't always been easy. Nonetheless, now the support for micro-businesspeople has grown and it is thanks to projects like Kiva that involve many people from around the world cooperating with each of them.

women averaging 32 years of age, with three children. They also live in polygamous families in Kola Diagada, a village in Bougouni, the third administrative region of Mali. They collaborate with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to better manage their agricultural activities during the rainy season. They are on their third loan with the institution, having duly repaid prior loans. Awa, the second one standing from the left, grows peanuts.

She uses the income from her business to help her husband raise their eight children. Gertrude has identified that there are growing demands among consumers\u2019 for her product and also she wanted to acquire formal education; hence she decide to take a loan. Nevertheless she is unable to meet their needs due to limited inventory capacity. Thus she aims to use her loan to purchase more processed fish to sell.

This is Isata, who is in her early forties; she is from Tombo, in the western rural area in Sierra Leone. She is married to a fisherman, and blessed with two children, ages 12  and 18.  Her children are going to school. \n\nIsata runs a food stand business at home; she sells rice, tomato paste, and cooking seasonings. She has been running this business since 2001. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Isatu says the main challenges to her business are price inflation and insufficient financing to expand her business.\n\nIsata has requested a loan to buy more cooking items like rice, tomato paste and cooking seasonings. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. \n\nIn the future, she plans to build a house.

The area boasts one of the best standards of living in the county, with affordable rents, good roads, access to water and lots of transportation options. She is unmarried and has six children, between 12 and 25. Only two are currently attending school, and four of them live at home. She cannot read or write, but she is good at managing her business. She describes herself as a good businesswoman. Tetee has had a table business for the past seven years. She works 10 hours, six days in a week, at her business. Her greatest challenge is her small income. She intends to use the loan to buy more foodstuffs, including cassava and bananas, for her business. She started her business with help from her fianc\u00e9, who sells charcoal. She likes her business because it helps her buy items in the home. In the future, she wants to own a house.  She wants to thank the lenders for supporting BRAC Liberia and its

Arimae is an 800-person Ember\u00e1 and Wounaan indigenous community in Panama\u2019s Darien province. They will use the $10,000 loan to buy plantain seed stock to incubate in the nursery, as seen in the photo. The loan will also cover costs for planting, maintaining, and harvesting the plantains. With the proceeds from the harvests the village will finance community development projects and support legal efforts to secure their reservation.\n\nOtilio is currently one of the caciques, or chiefs, for the community, and is a part of one of the founding members of the community of Arimae, which was formally founded in the 1970's to help defend the community's land from illegal loggers and cattle ranchers. \n\nThe residents of Arimae are ancestors of the Choc\u00f3 people who migrated from the Choc\u00f3 region of Colombia during the 16th century, and subsisted for generations as hunter-gatherers and fishermen. Today, the community members depend mostly on subsistence agriculture and day labor to put food on the table. Arimae is part of a network of indigenous reservations that once stretched for hundreds of thousands of hectares in the Darien. Over the past 30 years however, their land holdings have declined sharply as illegal logger and cattle ranchers encroach into their reservation in search of timber and pastureland.

She has had work experience as a salesperson in various grocery stores in the municipality she lives in, which allowed her to generate income to support her household for several years.  She is an enterprising, hardworking, and very active woman, but a lack of job opportunities made it impossible for her to find employment.  For this reason, she decided to go out on her own and start her own business.

Also, in summer they make clay tiles to sell to earn income to cover basic family needs.\r\n\r\nShe buys the materials she uses for the crops in a place where agricultural supplies are less expensive and for the summer they get the materials to make the clay tiles, soil and clay, by looking for them in nearby places where they are found since one must know the good kinds of soil and clay that are needed to have a good production.  This is why her husband takes care of looking for them and transporting them by truck to the place where they manufacture the tiles.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be used to buy fertilizer for the corn crop and to prepare the soil where they plant beans.

At this time he has 2 cows, and he wants to buy 2 more and then gradually increase his herd to a large number.  He previously obtained a degree in agriculture, and this motivated him to work in the area of livestock production.  In addition, he likes to have chickens since his wife can help with feeding them.\r\n\r\nHe buys the supplies he uses to care for his livestock, including vitamins and antibiotics, in the city.

He is motivated to continue in this line of work, which he enjoys.
