Other institutions have business experience or a stable revenue as requirements. The Start Up program allows the vulnerable poor, like Ekaterine, to get a chance to start or re-start a business. She requested a loan of $600 to begin trading with plastic dishes and personal consumption items such as socks, underwear, etc. at wholesale prices and then resell them among her friends and neighbors. This will give her a chance to earn an income and help her family members.

The group is on their eleventh loan with the institution, and their prior loans have been repaid in full.\r\n\r\nKoura, shown seated on the far right in the photo, grows crops of rice. With her \u200b\u200bloan, she intends to buy agricultural inputs and seeds, and pay for the labor needed to maintain one and a half hectares of farmland. After the harvest, her produce is sold at the village market and in Bougouni to a clientele composed of men and women.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn an income of 150,000 Francs CFA per agricultural cycle. This income will allow her to repay her loan and to help her husband with their daily household expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1401517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs and seeds, and pay for the labor needed during the agricultural cycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kassela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-07-30T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-29T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koura    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Adiara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sali            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sanata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Setou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sali              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Diarra   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sira         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Batoma  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":580000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":580000,"processed_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":581559.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045042}],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T21:29:20Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T16:36:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Hahn Leat","image":null}},{"id":588241,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricia is 42 years old, married and a mother of five children.

She has a higher education.  She had worked in Russia as a nurse for a long time.  She returned to Kyrgyzstan and is currently looking to be hired as a nurse at a local hospital.  She has been involved in animal husbandry for over 13 years, having started this business with 5,000 som (KGS).  Today her business contains two bulls.  The monthly profit from the business is 7,000 som (KGS).  Indira is caring, honest and hardworking.  She is raising her daughter alone.  In order to provide a decent future for her daughter, Indira requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls.  Indira plans to invest the earnings from the loan in further increasing livestock quantities in her business and also wants to provide a decent education for her only

","en":"Shahnoza is a young, married 29 year-old woman.  She lives with her family in the city of Dushanbe.  Shahnoza has a higher education in economics, but has not worked in her profession since getting married.  Now Shahnoza decided to work and be an independent woman.  Shahnoza's mother has a successful retail business.  She sells fabrics and materials.  Shahnoza has intentions to also start her own retail business.  She already leased a retail outlet at the central market of the city.  Shahnoza's starting capital amounts to 1000 US dollars.  However, this amount is not enough to purchase merchandise.  This is why Shahnoza requested a loan.  Shahnoza wants to use the loan and her savings to purchase fabrics and materials and start her sales.  According to Shahnoza's words, her mother, who brings merchandise from Turkey, will be the supplier of merchandise.  Shahnoza believes that her business will also be successful because her mother will be helping her.  Thanks to the loan, Shahnoza will have her own business, which will yield her a good income.

This is 48-year-old Massah from Kandeh town Bo, Southern area in Freetown. She is married with seven children between the ages of 6 years and 28 years. Four of her children are attending school.   \r\n\r\nMassah runs a cooked food business; she sells cooked rice, fried fish and cool drinks. She has been running this business for 20 years. She wakes up at 4:30 am to prepare her food business, and she will not rest until the food is finished. One of her daughters usually helps her to run the cooked food business. Her business is the only source of income she has. Massah describes her major hardship: sometimes to prepare the cooked food is very difficult.  \r\n\r\nMassah has requested a loan in order to purchase cooking item including a bag of rice, coconut oil and soft drinks and Pure Water. The extra income from this loan will allow her to change the cooked food structure where she works and serves the food and educate her children. In the future, she plans to have her own residence. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1397466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is now the father of a six-month-old girl.  He lives with his daughter and his common-law wife.\r\n\r\nHis parents taught him the businesses of farming, bricklaying and crafts (hammocks made of natural or artificial silk.)  His father taught him to make hammocks from the age of ten, and now he is very skilled.  All of his brothers also do this type of work.\r\n\r\nHe went to school in his village and obtained a basic education.  He currently provides a living for his own family.  His hammock business is profitable.  He sells his goods in his local community and in two other cities on Saturdays and Sundays, and also makes them at the request of customers.  He makes 12-14 hammocks each month.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he also works with his father growing corn.  They are raising 7,000 square meters of this crop in their area.\r\n\r\nJavier buys his materials (thread, tubing, thimbles and caps) in the closest city.  He has to travel by bus for one hour to get there.  He goes every eight days, and on other occasions, depending on what orders he has to fill.\r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to purchase three boxes of silk thread, 40 pairs of thimbles, three dozen caps and plastic tubing for making hammocks.  He will invest the remainder in agriculture, since he also works alongside his father growing crops.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds, he will obtain the supplies he needs so he can continue making hammocks and increase his production.  He has orders and at times needs to fill them on a deadline.  This will also allow him to offer more products to his customers.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he will be able to improve his quality of life.  His corn crops will ensure that he can feed his family.  At the same time he will make more income from the sale of his hammocks, which will enable him to provide sustenance to his wife and daughter.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to grow his sales little by little.  He also wants to create a permanent location for his business where his customers can come to shop.  In addition, he plans to build a house for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1399934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase three boxes of silk thread, 40 pairs of thimbles, three dozen caps and plastic tubing for making hammocks.

He lives in a common-law marriage with his partner and has 6 children. Due to lack of work opportunities, Ever and his family have been through difficult financial situations, but Ever's spirit, strength and desire to get ahead in life motivated him to open his own business. Together with his wife, they refurbished the living room of their house about a year ago and opened a home-based Internet Cafe. This has allowed them to generate income and provide for their large family. Ever and his wife work long hours. They open every day of the week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\r\nEver is asking for a loan to invest in the purchase of two work stations (computers) to expand his business and meet the demands of his customers, which he cannot do with his current equipment. This will improve his sales and family income. It will also allow Ever to move towards achieving his goal of having a well organized business, with quality equipment and able to provide excellent service. This in turn will improve his family's well-being and quality of life and will allow Ever to provide an excellent education for his children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1400283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase two computers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Monter\u00eda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ever Augusto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65615},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67409},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69252},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71145},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73090},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75089},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77142},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79251},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81417},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83643},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85930},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88280},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90693},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93173},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95720},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98337},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101026},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103788}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.05,"local_amount":135087,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":135749.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822315},{"amount":36.96,"local_amount":69305,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":69645.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807304},{"amount":39.23,"local_amount":73565,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":73925.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095395},{"amount":37.85,"local_amount":70977,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":71325.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074458},{"amount":38.4,"local_amount":72006,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":72359.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009656},{"amount":41.51,"local_amount":77802,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:50:38Z","rounded_local_amount":78183.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523237},{"amount":534,"local_amount":1001258,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1006170.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227016}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T18:18:03Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T09:57:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Leticia Barbero","image":835885}},{"id":589822,"name":"Kelly Juliett","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kelly, a sus 27 a\u00f1os de edad es separada y madre cabeza de hogar, vive con sus dos hijos de 7 y 10 a\u00f1os.

This is Phorn's fourth microloan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019 partner). He has fully repaid his past loans with success to sustain his business and improve his living conditions.

average 39 years of age and four children each, all living in polygamous families in DISSAN, a village in BOUGOUNI (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The women are collaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to carry out their rainy season farm work. They are on their fifth loan with the institution. The past loans were indeed paid back.\r\n\r\nRice is the crop grown by KOROTOUMOU, who is the third woman from the right.

Before that occasion, Tina used to import secondhand furniture from Turkey and sold them in Georgia. She wants to restart up the trading business but found she didn\u2019t have enough money to do so.\r\n\r\nTina couldn\u2019t receive a loan from the local financial institutions, because of their requirements to have business experience or stable revenue, until the Start Up program began which is a joint product of Kiva and Credo. The program allows vulnerable poor like Tina to get a chance for starting or re-starting businesses. She requested a loan of 1200 USD to restart trading furniture.

is a 44-year-old divorced mother of two children. She is working hard to develop her business to provide them with the best living conditions and education. She has been working for four years in preparing and selling special creamy minced garlic. It is specialized for restaurants where it is served with all kinds of chicken and in most sandwiches to add a delicious juicy taste. Fahda's business is going on just fine, but needs development to increase her family's income and meet her children's needs.

For twenty years now, Veronica has been supporting her family in coordination with her husband by running a 'genge' (small shop) selling fruits and vegetables. She works from 7 am to 4 pm daily and is able to make a good profit per month. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 17th loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania, She used the previous loans to buy more 'genge' items like tomatoes, sacks of onions, coconuts, and more vegetables with high demand. She bought two fridges to put in her new retail shop she opened. With the profit from the business, Veronica paid school fees for her children and also home expenses. She will use this loan to buy the missing 'genge' items. She dreams that one day she will be able to own a wholesale business.\r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group \"Makuti A\" which totals 11 members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

She is doing fine with her business. She works from 6 am to 5 pm daily, and is able to make a good profit in a month. \r\n\r\nThis will be her ninth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans to restock more food items along with soft drinks, and has paid back all her loans successfully. With the profit received, she covered school fees and reinvested in the business. She will use this loan to buy a refrigerator for her business.  \r\n\r\nAneth dreams that one day,  she will be able to offer more food services to her food enterprise. \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group,\" UNITY\", which consists of 13 members.

She lives with her partner and has four children. She is very experienced at managing her business, which she has had for ten years. Before opening this shop, she was a seamstress, but did not have enough customers to make a living from that trade alone. She learned how to manage a shop entirely on her own, since she had to take care of her children and did not have a steady income on which to live. At first, she had problems finding merchandise, so she started out on a very small scale. However, she has since managed to grow gradually, in order to meet customer demand. Nowadays, the shop has everything a customer needs, and is open from 5 in the morning to 9 in the evening. In order to buy supplies for her shop, Patricia needs to take a bus ride from where she lives to the city, which is approximately 45 minutes away. There, she buys what she needs in a wholesale shop, and takes the bus back home. The loan she asks for is to buy a sack of broad beans, a sack of rice, a sack of sugar, cooking oil, soap, detergent, and other everyday products, in order to renew her stock and keep satisfying her customers. Moreover, the more varied the merchandise she sells, the more customers are likely to become regulars, which will provide Patricia with a steady income. She plans to buy sewing machines and to have her own workshop in order to fulfill orders from some retail shops, since she is, after all, a qualified seamstress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1399695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy various everyday products to sell at her shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":24.04},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":24.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":27.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":27.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":27.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":29.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":31.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":35.16},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":35.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":38.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":49.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815007}],"funded_date":"2013-08-29T22:06:46Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:28:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":588359,"name":"Shpresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shpresa is a married Egyptian Albanian in her early 50s with no children.

She owns a shop in a market town not far from where she lives, where she sells first-necessity products such as basic grains, cooking oil, macaroni, noodles, detergent, toilet paper, etc. She has had this business for five years and the number of customers keeps rising, because she takes care to devote part of the profits to keeping the shop well-stocked.

Since his wife left him he has looked after the children and has fought tirelessly to bring them up properly. For the last 7 years he has been selling hay, which he buys from nearby growers and sells on at a higher price in various cities in the country such as Cali, Medll\u00edn and Bogot\u00e1. He learnt the business from a friend. Ricardo works hard every day to provide sustenance for his family. His work is not stable and he has to overcome various challenges such as the weather, which damages the hay crop in the winter and so his purchase cost goes up, making it difficult to sell. In spite of all the obstacles, he has a positive and entrepreneurial attitude and actively seeks options which will help him to get on in life. \r\n\r\nThis is why he is asking for the loan with the intention of buying hay wholesale (2 trips) since he is offered a discount for paying cash and he can benefit from this to increase his profit.

She received economic support from her parents to make her first purchases and managed to recuperate the investment on her first sale to wood dealers in the capital.

He buys the sheep and slaughters them himself to sell to local residents and always tries to provide his customers with fresh meat. He has several regular customers at the local market. Mirzo wants to expand his business and has asked for a loan of 5000 somoni to buy more sheep.

is 52 years old. He lives in the Tskaltubo district with his father, who is provided with a retirement pension. Vazha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milking cow and a calf, whose milk is used in cheese products. In addition, they have a vineyard and a hectare of agricultural land where maize is grown. They sell the harvested products and cheese at local markets at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nVazha requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Vazha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this loan, Vazha will purchase two additional milking cows with which he will be able to produce more cheese to sell. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

The loan will benefit this group of micro-businesswomen, of which Koshie is a member.\r\n\r\nKoshie says that she joined ID-Ghana four years ago and became a founding member of this group. This is her second loan request to Kiva, and fifth loan cycle with ID-Ghana. Koshie is standing in the middle in the photograph.\r\n\r\nShe currently has a business selling provisions and cosmetics. She started this business three years ago, on her own initiative. Before that, she was selling jeans. Koshie will use her part of this loan, GHS 1500, to increase her capital. She will buy items from the market, including body cream, hair cream, baby Pampers, and fruit drinks. She will sell them, by hawking to her customers. This work allows her to make an income for her family. Koshie is 30 years old, single, and has three children. When asked what she likes about ID-Ghana, Koshie replied that she likes the health insurance services and the training sessions. She says her loans have made it possible to take care of her children and her needs, by saving part of her profits and reinvestment of the other part, in her

Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":590171,"name":"Sam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For most people in Rwanda, electricity is a luxury.  Seated just south of the equator, the Rwandan sky is pitch-black each evening at 6pm, and seeing lights glowing from inside a home is a rarity. \n\nIn Rwanda, just 11% of people have access to electricity, which means 8 million rural households use smoky, asthma-inducing and inefficient kerosene to light their homes. Without access to reliable energy, children often walk for hours to gather firewood instead of attending school, and adults lack reliable ways to charge the phones that keep them in touch with family or the market. Light for homework becomes prohibitively expensive, and rural hospital power outages put lives in danger. \n\nRwanda-based Great Lakes Energy (GLE) provides low-cost and environmentally friendly solar energy products that bring electricity to those most in need, but they need your support to improve their reach to the most vulnerable.  \n\nFounded by Sam, an American who has been living in Rwanda for the past decade, GLE and its team of Rwandans provides clean electricity to rural consumers, healthcare centers, orphanages and schools throughout Rwanda. \n\nCurrently, the team runs its Rwanda-wide operations using outdated paper systems and a few old computers.  Up until now, GLE has focused its investments solely on its solar products, improving technologies to drive down costs for their consumers.  However, with outdated systems and IT equipment, GLE is struggling to keep up with existing clients and meet the demands of new clients in the larger market.\n\nRight now, when the team installs solar panels at rural hospitals to give doctors access to stable light to perform examinations and patients access to life-saving machines, they plan installations on paper drawings and schedules because their computers are too unreliable to take to the field.  Detailed records are extremely difficult to maintain, risking missing vital maintenance checks, which can derail the promise of the solar light.  With extra time spent keeping paper records, they are diverting key resources away from spreading access to electricity.  \n\nGLE is looking for new funding to purchase much needed IT equipment. This will allow the team to use engineering tablets and notepads to produce real-time drawings and electrical specifications. This increased efficiency will allow GLE to help more Rwandans access power, hire more local labor, and serve their customers more efficiently and accurately.  \n\nThis business innovation has real impact on people\u2019s lives: supporting GLE means supporting more rural Rwandan families to tap into the benefits of electricity that are still out of reach for too many.   With solar, health improves.  Education improves.  Rwandans save several days of earnings each month on not purchasing CO2-emitting kerosene. \n\nBut more than anything else, individual families can access the means to create better lives for themselves and their children.

He lives in a small village in the south of Lebanon. For the past 19 years, he has owned shops where he has sold sandwiches, vegetables, and hookahs. In 2010, he opened his current sandwich shop.

de profesi\u00f3n y tiene su misma edad; con \u00e9l tiene 2 hijos de 7 y 10 a\u00f1os que est\u00e1n prepar\u00e1ndose en una escuela fiscal y a quienes en su tiempo libre ayuda y revisa sus tareas. Ana vive con su esposo e hijos en la ciudad de Latacunga, una de las ciudades m\u00e1s importantes del Ecuador y que est\u00e1 en pleno desarrollo y crecimiento. Su casa est\u00e1 ubicada en la Parroquia Juan Montalvo, un poco alejada de la ciudad. El mayor sue\u00f1o de ella es poder adquirir un terreno para construir su casa propia.\nAna trabaj\u00f3 desde que era una ni\u00f1a, combinaba su trabajo con los estudios de la escuela primaria, la cual pudo terminar, adquiriendo as\u00ed los conocimientos b\u00e1sicos que le ayudar\u00edan en la administraci\u00f3n de su propio negocio. \nCuando naci\u00f3 el primog\u00e9nito de Ana, en su hogar hab\u00eda mucha felicidad pero a la vez preocupaci\u00f3n, pues los recursos eran escasos y un nuevo miembro de la familia implicaba incrementar los gastos, es en ese momento, que Ana pone en pr\u00e1ctica lo que aprendi\u00f3 desde muy ni\u00f1a con su madre y prepara \u201cquimbolitos\u201d para la posterior venta. \nEl \u201cquimbolito\u201d es un pastel que est\u00e1 envuelto en hojas de \u201cachira\u201d y se cocina al vapor, preparado con harina de ma\u00edz y de trigo, este postre suele servirse con caf\u00e9 y muchas familias en el Ecuador lo preparan como comida tradicional. \nAna invierte entre 8 y 10 horas cada d\u00eda para la preparaci\u00f3n y venta de este producto, aunque en su casa ella tiene un lugar espec\u00edfico en donde van a buscarla sus clientes; Ana tambi\u00e9n sale a ofrecer sus productos en las \u00e1reas comerciales y residenciales de la ciudad para vender la producci\u00f3n diaria. \nEsta mujer innovadora, requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para poder comprar ingredientes con los que prepara los \u201cquimbolitos\u201d, pues por falta de \u00e9stos ha habido d\u00edas que la producci\u00f3n se ha detenido y a pesar de la demanda de sus clientes, Ana no ha podido abastecerse de la cantidad suficiente de ingredientes para preparar el volumen que siempre pone a disponibilidad de sus clientes. \nAna espera que con este pr\u00e9stamo ella pueda producir mayor cantidad y adem\u00e1s tenga en stock los ingredientes necesarios para seguir siempre con la producci\u00f3n, pues adem\u00e1s comprando al por mayor ella obtiene mayores descuentos y este ahorro le genera mayores ingresos con los que puede brindar a su familia un mejor estilo de vida.","en":"\r\nAna, 27, is married to \u00c1ngel who works in construction and is her same age.  She has two children with him who are 7 and 10 years old and are attending public school and who she helps and goes over their homework in her free time.  Ana lives with her husband and children in the city of Latacunga one of Ecuador\u2019s most important cities because it\u2019s in complete development and growth.  Her house is located in Juan Montalvo Parish, a bit distant from the city.  Her greatest dream is to be able to acquire land on which to build her own house.\r\n\r\nAna has worked since she was a girl; she combined work with elementary school studies and was able to complete it acquiring basic skills that would help her manage her own business.\r\n\r\nWhen Ana\u2019s first-born was born her home was full of joy but also with worry because their resources were scarce and the new family member implied increased costs.  It was at that moment that Ana put into practice what she\u2019d learned as a little girl with her mother and started making \u201cquimbolitos\u201d to sell.\r\n\r\nA \u201cquimbolito\u201d is a steamed corn and wheat flour cake wrapped in canna leaves; it\u2019s a dessert often served with coffee and many families in Ecuador make it as a traditional dish.\r\n\r\nAna invests between 8 and 10 hours daily making and selling this product; although she has a specific spot at home where customers come looking for her, Ana also goes out to offer her products in commercial and residential areas in the city in order to sell her entire daily production.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s very innovating and needs a loan to buy the ingredients used to make \u201cquimbolitos\u201d because the lack of these ingredients has led to days when production has ceased despite customer demand.  Ana\u2019s been unable to stock up on enough ingredients to make the volume she usually has available for her customers.\r\n\r\nAna hopes that with this loan she\u2019ll be able to produce a larger amount and also to have the necessary ingredients in stock so that production can always proceed.  Also, buying at wholesale allows her to access larger discounts and this savings generates higher profits with which she can provide her family with a better lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1400937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy \"quimbolito\" ingredients at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T18:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T18:20:15Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":84.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":85.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":88.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":92.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":93.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":95.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":98.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":99.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":102.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168.43,"local_amount":167.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":168.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814484},{"amount":86.55,"local_amount":85.87,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":86.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320655},{"amount":89.02,"local_amount":88.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":89.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856343},{"amount":117.11,"local_amount":116.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":117.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059921},{"amount":65.96,"local_amount":65.45,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":65.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995254},{"amount":101.53,"local_amount":100.73,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":101.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413692},{"amount":89.04,"local_amount":88.34,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":89.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102334},{"amount":110.25,"local_amount":109.39,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":110.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212224},{"amount":99.43,"local_amount":98.65,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":99.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138229},{"amount":197.68,"local_amount":196.13,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":197.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832244}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T21:32:22Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":588452,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 34 years old and married, with five children who are all school-going.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Ever since I can remember I've always enjoyed painting and designing, so I studied graphic design. However, my wife and her family have been crafting jewelry for generations, and slowly I started designing jewelry. Soon it became my passion. My wife enjoys practicing the techniques her father taught her and eventually we realized it was better to leave the crafting to her, the designing to me. We only get one life to live, and that's why my constant challenge is to succeed every day a little bit more so I can provide a better future for my wife and family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please receive a big hug and my deepest gratitude all the way from Peru.

She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business 12 hours per day and seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of sufficient capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nJaminatu requires a loan in order to buy a variety of stock, like toothpaste, soap, and cream, to expand her business.

She is married with five children, ages 10 to 25.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Fatmata established her motor oil business. She began her business because she wanted to create a permanent source of income, and she works at the business from 8:00 am until 6:00 pm, Monday to Friday. She says the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan to purchase more items like brake oil and different types of motor oil. She hopes the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and buy a piece of land. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fatmata plans to own the biggest shop in the community. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1397768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict

She is married and has four children, ages 7 to 20 years.  In 2003, Wullamatu established her grocery-selling business. She began her business, because she was a housewife but she wanted to create her own source of income to contribute to the care of the children.  She works at the business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, seven days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and the high cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nWullamatu requires a loan, in order to expand her business by purchasing more rice, cooking seasonings, and coconut oil. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and increase her business. In the future, Wullamatu plans to expand her business, even more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1397696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married, with four children between the ages of 11 and 28 years.  \r\n\r\nSusan began her business because she wanted to create her own source of income, instead of depending on her husband. In 2000, Susan established her general stock business. She works at the business from 8:00am until 6:00pm, Monday through Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nSusan requires a loan in order to purchase gallons of cooking oil, to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to take care of her family's welfare and to buy a piece of land. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Susan plans to own the biggest shop in the community. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1397783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married and has two children, ages 3 and 10 years. She began her business, because she wants to create her own source of income instead of depending on her husband. In 2011, Kadiatu established her general stock business.  She works at the business from 8:00am until 6:00pm, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to purchase more items to sell, like cigarettes, soft drinks, and milk. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and buy a piece of land. In the future, Kadiatu plans to own the biggest shop in the community. She thanks you for your

The 14-year-old helps with the family farming operation, and the 12-year-old is currently in school. Sara learned various farming techniques from her husband, and they now work together to plant, prune, clean, fertilize and water their land and coffee crops.

The area boasts one of the best standards of living in the county with affordable rents, good roads, access to water, and lots of transportation options. \r\n\r\nSoway is a unmarried mother with a two-year-old child, who is living at home with her. The last grade she finished before getting to business was grade 12. For the past three years she has been doing this business. She started this business with money given to her by her fiancee. She enjoys her business because the business gives her more money.  She sells six days a week, from 9 am to 5 pm, and most of the time she uses a  shared taxi to get her goods to her spot. She is requesting a loan to purchase more used clothes for her business. Her plan is to build a house and educate her child."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1397829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for its fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nFelecia completed 8th grade and is married.  Her husband is a pastor.  She has three children between the ages of 17 and 10. Her three children are in school and they all live at home. \r\n\r\nFelecia has owned her own 'table business' (a small food stall) selling milk, eggs, soft drinks, etc. for the past four years.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase milk, eggs, soft drinks, etc.  \r\n\r\nOn average, she works 7 hours a day at her business.  She started her business with money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by taxi.  She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge.  Her favorite part of her business is the profit.  In the future, she would like to build a shop. \r\n \r\nShe thanks you in advance for your

She transports her goods by taxi.  \r\n\r\nShe started her business with money from her savings.  She is proud of her business because she makes a profit. Her plan is to build a house.

She currently lives in a modest house.  She works in the dairy business, having begun at a young age by helping her mother, whom Arminda currently cares for.  Arminda is grateful for what her mother taught her about the business.  Arminda tells us that the dairy business is now the family's main source of income.  She eventually wants to work as a nurse, too, because she worked so hard to gain her clinic nurse qualification.

","en":"Javier is 31 years old and is married to Vilma, who is 28 years old.  They have one son who was born 3 years ago.  Javier lives with his family in the house of his father-in-law Jorge, who has been a great source of support for them and who also works in agriculture.  They live in Alaquez, a parish in the rural region of Latacunga which preserves the history of several of the original cultures of Ecuador.  In the middle of the countryside, in an area with a cool climate, are many farming families who work the land in order to grow the best possible fruit. Javier learned the work of agriculture when he was a child from his mother, who supported him through primary school.  Although Javier would have liked to continue with his education, he began working in the fields, with the dream of one day owning his own home where his family could enjoy a comfortable place to live.  Five years ago this hardworking man decided to specialize in the production of potatoes.  He works at this activity for 8 hours every day starting very early, so that the meticulous care that he devotes to his crops each day will result in a product of high quality without any loss of plants.  Thus he will avoid losses and ensure the loyalty of his customers. The special care that Javier provides to his land and crops requires supplies, such as fertilizer, that he must buy wholesale in order to properly care for his crops.  For this reason he is requesting a loan with which he will be able to make this purchase and thus move forward with his work, which supports his family.  Javier is grateful for the support that people around the world can provide so that his business won't stagnate, and to the Fundacion Alternativa for allowing him to apply for a loan from Kiva, which has motivated him to continue working with care and dedication so as not to disappoint those who have believed in him."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1401037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer for his potato crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Javier Oswaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700.52,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":55.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":56.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":60.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":61.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":63.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.26,"local_amount":48.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814485},{"amount":54.86,"local_amount":53.01,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":54.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320656},{"amount":56.48,"local_amount":54.57,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":56.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856344},{"amount":120.4,"local_amount":116.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":120.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059922},{"amount":58.93,"local_amount":56.94,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":58.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413693},{"amount":124.64,"local_amount":120.43,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":124.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102335},{"amount":63.27,"local_amount":61.13,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212225},{"amount":196.16,"local_amount":189.55,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":196.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138230}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T18:46:02Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:19:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorna Gladman","image":733132}},{"id":588537,"name":"Cristo Redentor 1, 3 & 4 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsa is one of the members of the group called Cristo Redentor 1, 3 & 4.

","en":"Juli\u00e1n is 22 years old, is single, and has no children.  Due to a lack of job opportunities, it has been difficult for him to find employment after having quit his job at a milk and cheese factory because they were exploiting their employees.  For this reason, and with the need to move forward and support his family financially, he decided to open his own business, a micro-business for selling and distributing milk products, taking advantage of the four years of experience that he has in the field.  He will begin with selling cheeses.  Juli\u00e1n already began with a downpayment for his business via some savings that he had collected, but he needs the support of a loan in order to invest in the purchase of machines (a grating machine, a packing and sealing machine, and a small refrigerator), as well as materials (implements for packaging, plastic resealable bags). With this he will be able to begin the work of his business and will be able to generate income to support his parents, as well as advance and prosper his business, to purchase fresh cheese in bulk, and to have his own brand for distribution.  In this way he will be able to improve his quality of life and provide a better living for his

He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of silver, given that the current price of silver is at its lowest point in years.\r\n\r\nPictured here with his sister, Ruth, Teodoro has been selling through NOVICA since 2012. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"My artistic formation came from my dad during his work as an archeologist in pre-Hispanic sites, and later as the curator of a museum. That's when I became inspired to craft jewelry with designs and motifs unique to ancient Peru. One of my most cherished moments was when I had a small workshop and my children, Carlos and Alicia, were with me while I was cutting gems by hand. Then we put the gems through a little machine to perfect the contours. I love the idea that foreigners can share part of our history through my designs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to send my gratitude and a big hug to all of you for this micro-credit loan. It is such a great feeling to know that there are people like you, who live faraway and know me only through a photograph, and yet you trust me with this credit.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Teodoro's sterling silver and gemstone jewelry on the NOVICA site:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8651"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1398089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in a bulk purchase of silver for his handcrafted jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodoro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":11.94,"local_amount":11.94,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T17:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410186688},{"amount":151.34,"local_amount":151.34,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T19:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":151.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419949311},{"amount":40.35,"local_amount":40.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":40.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602121},{"amount":60.34,"local_amount":60.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":60.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829169},{"amount":36.03,"local_amount":36.03,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":36.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449718811}],"funded_date":"2013-08-01T08:30:01Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:43:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}}]}
