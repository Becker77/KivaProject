She is married and has 2 children, age 12 & 5 yrs. She has 1 additional dependent who lives with her because of schooling.  In 2011, Fatmata established her sugar, mayonnaise, sardines, powdered milk, etc. business. She began her business because she wants to help her husband in the home. Her business is located in the outskirts of the city, and her main customers are general community people.

She is married and has 2 children, ages 16 and 21 years. Hawa has 2 additional dependents who live with her for assistance in schooling. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Hawa established her fish business. She began her business because she wanted to assist her family. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 900,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Hawa requires a loan in order to buy more cartons of fish to sell and get more profit.

Celia's husband works as a farmer.\r\n\r\nCelia has a small store where she sells all types of basic consumer goods such as: vegetables, housewares, and stationery.  She also has some telephone cabins, and sells cell phone recharges from various cellular providers.  She works every day from 6am until 6pm, and even later some days.  She's had this store for more than 14 years, and with her businesses she generates earnings that are a big help to her family, since her husband doesn't earn very much from his work in the fields.\r\n\r\nCelia will use this loan to buy groceries, because she wants to expand her business.  She is a founding member of her communal bank, and she likes it because of the help that is provided with these loans.\r\n\r\nCelia's goal is to have a much bigger store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1401102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T22:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750.69,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":155,"local_amount":150.14,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815867},{"amount":155,"local_amount":150.14,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410966078},{"amount":155.01,"local_amount":150.14,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":155.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857814},{"amount":232.5,"local_amount":225.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":232.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506183},{"amount":77.49,"local_amount":75.06,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":77.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439729958}],"funded_date":"2013-08-02T01:17:06Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:09:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":590240,"name":"Luis Fernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis a sus 44 a\u00f1os de edad es casado y no tiene hijos.

He has received support from loans to improve his business, and that's what motivated him to request his fifth loan, which he will invest by purchasing supplies in bulk ($1.500.000 worth of corn and $500.000 worth of charcoal) to take advantage of the discount that he receives. This way, he will have raw materials available to fill the pending orders and increase his income.\r\n\r\nAntonio dreams of expanding his business, reaching many more customers, and offering a very high-quality product that satisfies their needs and tastes. In this way, he will be able to increase his income and give his family a better quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1396858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies in bulk (1,500,000 COP worth of corn and 500,000 COP worth of charcoal).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-07-31T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-30T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio Jos\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87541},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":89928},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":92381},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":94900},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":97488},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100147},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":102878},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":105683},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":108566},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":111526},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":114568},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":117692},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":120902},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":124199},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":127586},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":131065},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":134639},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":138311}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meghan Rishel","image":1056096}},{"id":588643,"name":"Jerlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As the married mother of two children, Jerlyn works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fishing business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from selling dried fish and pig fattening.

She gained work experience when she worked in a mine, but she became ill with malaria and retired from her job.  Her financial situation was then very difficult because her entire household is completely dependent on her for sustenance.  For this reason, and motivated to provide a better life for her children, one year ago she decided to open a grocery store with the savings that she had.  She works in the store from 6 am to 10 pm to earn the income necessary to support her children.  She learned the business from her father, who always had his own shops.\r\n\r\nShe is a strong, hardworking woman who is always looking for opportunities to get ahead.  For this reason she is seeking a loan to invest in her store.

Valle Hermoso es una parroquia rural en donde hay aproximadamente siete mil habitantes, es el escenario para los amantes de los deportes extremos, pues sus cascadas y r\u00edos son los recursos naturales m\u00e1s adecuados para esto. Es un sitio con clima c\u00e1lido y sus habitantes tienen un esp\u00edritu emprendedor impresionante, pues aprovechan el clima para explotar la actividad agr\u00edcola con la cual se producen frutos como la pi\u00f1a, la palma africana, maracuy\u00e1 y palmito. Adem\u00e1s las actividades ganaderas, av\u00edcolas y porcinas son muy frecuentes en este sector.

La experiencia le ha ense\u00f1ado lo importante de siempre contar con aquellos productos que sus clientes, quienes en su mayor\u00eda son mujeres, m\u00e1s necesiten o usen con frecuencia, es por ello que Luz desea incrementar su negocio comprando productos al por mayor, con lo que obtendr\u00e1 mayores descuentos por parte de sus proveedores y tambi\u00e9n recibir\u00e1 premios por su compra, lo que le ayudar\u00e1 a mejorar sus utilidades y de esta forma mejorar su estilo de vida y el de su hijo, adem\u00e1s de convertirse en una microempresaria de la industria de la belleza como siempre ha sido su sue\u00f1o.

Ahora gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva podr\u00e1 obtener un pr\u00e9stamo financiado por varias personas alrededor del mundo que creen en ella y con quienes Luz est\u00e1 muy agradecida. \nLuz una mujer que es l\u00edder por naturaleza, est\u00e1 al frente del Grupo \u201cEl Rosario\u201d, un grupo de 4 personas que se unieron tras el mismo objetivo; buscar apoyo para mejorar y crecer con el negocio que  emprendieron hace algunos a\u00f1os para mejorar su calidad de vida y la de sus familias.\nSus amigos emprendedores como ella; Mar\u00eda Dolores, Manuel y Dina se dedican a diferentes actividades que son el sustento para cada d\u00eda. Mar\u00eda Dolores se dedica a la crianza de cerdos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n y esta actividad le ayuda para la manutenci\u00f3n de sus 6 hijos, necesita su parte del pr\u00e9stamo para comprar cerdos y alimento para ellos. Manuel es un hombre que a sus 65 a\u00f1os a\u00fan trabaja en la venta de madera y utilizar\u00e1 su parte del pr\u00e9stamo para mejorar su espacio de trabajo y comprar herramientas. En cambio Dina es una mujer de 57 a\u00f1os, y tiene una tienda de art\u00edculos de primera necesidad la cual ha sido el sustento para su familia durante varios a\u00f1os. Los integrantes de este grupo tienen en com\u00fan el trabajo duro y esforzado que realizan cada d\u00eda y que  sin embargo no ha sido causa para que alguno se d\u00e9 por vencido, pues sus motivaciones personales y familiares les fortalecen para seguir adelante y luchar por sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"Luz, 50, studied up to a few years in high school and then decided to start working to help with the household expenses. She is single and has one son who she supports.  He is studying and they live in Valle Hermoso parish in the Santo Domingo canton in Ecuador. \nValle Hermoso is a rural parish with approximately 7,000 inhabitants. It is a good place for extreme sports lovers since its waterfalls and rivers are the natural resources most suited for this. It is a place with warm weather and the inhabitants have a very entrepreneurial spirit. They take advantage of the weather for farming and grow fruits such as pineapple, African oil palm, passion fruit and palmetto. Other popular ways to make a living  in this area are livestock, poultry and pig farming. \nSales jobs are also very frequent such as in the case of Luz, who for several years has been selling cosmetics through mail order catalogs. Luz has gained a lot of experience in sales and collections. For several hours a day she visits clients to show them her products as well as to deliver orders. She also walks the long streets of the city to collect outstanding balances and to pay her suppliers. \nExperience has taught her the importance of always depend on the products that her clients, a majority women, mostly need or use with frequency. This is why Luz would like to increase her business to buy products at whole sale. This way she will receive bigger discounts from the suppliers and also get awards for her purchases which will help her to improve her profits and in this way improve life for her and her son. \nAlso, becoming a small business woman in the cosmetics industry has always been her dream. Her biggest business hurdle has been the lack of capital and therefore only has a few products. Now, thanks to  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva ,she will be able to get a loan from several people from around the world who believe in her. Luz is very grateful. \nLuz who is a natural leader, is the head of the \u201cEl Rosario\u201d Group.  This is a four person group who united behind the same objective, find help to improve and grow with the business they learnt to do a few years ago and improve the quality of life for them and their families. \nHer entrepreneur friends, just like her, Mar\u00eda Dolores, Manuel and Dina, work different jobs in order to live day to day.\n Mar\u00eda Dolores grows pigs to sell. This helps her support her six children. She needs her part of the loan to buy pigs and feed for them. \nManuel  still works at 65, selling wood and will use his part of the loan to improve his work space and buy tools. \nDina, is a 57 year old woman who has a convenience store which has helped support her family for many years. \nThe members of this group have in common that they work hard work and they have not given up. Their personal and family motivations have made them stronger so they can keep moving ahead and fight for their dreams. \n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1395793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy products at whole sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-08-01T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-31T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel Blas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2402.68,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":199.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":223.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":230.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":231.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":241.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":243.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":248.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":256.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":260.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":266.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofie Bjorksten","image":null}},{"id":580800,"name":"Sara","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

He is in a common-law relationship. Since he was little, he learned farm work alongside his family. Thanks to that experience, he now grows bananas and raises pigs for sale. This has allowed him to earn income to support his family daily. Every day, he tirelessly fights to overcome the obstacles present due to external factors. The winter causes flooding and at times, it has damaged crops. However, little by little, with patience, great care and dedication, he has managed to succeed motivated by his family.

This allows him to obtain resources to continue caring for and providing for his children. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is a strong and determined man. Motivated by his family, he strives every day to get ahead. This has inspired him to request this loan to invest in the purchase of pigs and piglets to fatten and sell so that he will be able to have enough stock to fill the orders that are coming in and improve his profit margin and income. In this way, Julio hopes to be one step closer to realizing his greatest dream, which is to formalize his business and set up a meat shop that will be profitable and enduring. He hopes to achieve economic stability in order to give his children the opportunity to have a better education and better living conditions."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1401123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase pigs and piglets to fatten and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Monter\u00eda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-01T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-31T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio Iv\u00e1n ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60057},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61699},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63386},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65118},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66899},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68728},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70607},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72537},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74520},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76558},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78651},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80801},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83010},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85280},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87611},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90007},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92467},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94996},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97593},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100261},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103002},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105818},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108711},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111683}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":590290,"name":"Ferm\u00edn Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ferm\u00edn, a sus 58 a\u00f1os de edad es casado y padre de 2 hijos.

In this way she will be able to increase her income from sales and be able to continue fighting to make her dream reality, which is to accredit her business, expand and build customer loyalty and have the ability to provide employment to others, thus achieving an economic stability and provide a better education and quality of life for her small son."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1401187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy items and groceries (soda pop, liquor, beer, snacks, potatoes, turnovers, cakes) and to make some facility improvements (change the door and fix the bathroom).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Itagui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-01T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-31T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90085},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92548},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95078},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97678},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100348},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103092},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105910},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108806},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111781},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114837},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117976},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121202},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124515},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127920},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131417},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135010},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138701},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142493},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146389},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150391},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154503},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158727},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163067},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167526}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.98},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":590253,"name":"Mar\u00eda De La Cruz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, con 58 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de 3 hijos y vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su pareja.

She is a hard working woman that is now helping her father to grow basic grains. She brings her father his food to the land where they have the crops and then stays for a couple of hours helping him with the tasks involved in the growing of basic grains. She does this even though she is a single mother, because this doesn't stop her from moving forward. On the contrary, this is an additional motivation to keep striving every day.\r\nIsabel buys the supplies she needs for sowing the basic grains, such as herbicides, fertilizer and insecticide, in the city. It takes her an hour to get from her home to the city in a truck due to the poor state of the roads.

Evila sells fish, starting very early in the morning when she goes to the fishing docks in the city to get the types of fish that have the best market price. She makes her sales in bulk, but in order to sell everything she has to work very hard to attract her customers, as the competition is strong. She starts work at 4am and finishes at 7 or 8am. Sometimes she sells from in front of her home. She has been doing this for more than 5 years, working alone, and she says that the gains that she has made as a result of her good work and the  money that she has generated for her family are her primary motive for looking for ways to improve.

She will also use the rest to pay workers who will clear her farm and split her firewood. She believes the business will succeed because she has been doing it for a long time, has regular customers, and has fertile land to cultivate her yam seedlings. The community will benefit because there will be no scarcity of firewood around and the community will have enough food.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will cater to her family's needs, ensure her children's education, and she will build her house. She prefers GHAPE loans because of low interest rates, convenient repayment intervals, and also the members are trained on marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1384591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy firewood and yam seedlings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

With this business activity, the community will benefit because it will ease their movement from one place to another.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, John will cater to his family's needs, ensure his children's education, and he will renovate his house. He prefers GHAPE loans because of their low interest rates and convenient repayment intervals. Also, the members are trained in marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1384596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a new bike and pay for its required documents.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

In the afternoon, she goes about ten minutes away from her house to go to a cafeteria where she sells her stuffed tortillas.  She returns to her home at about 5:00pm.  She says that her dream is to have her own, strong store.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy five sacks of corn, two sacks of beans, 2 quintales (about 100 kilos) of rice, 4 boxes of soap to wash clothing, 10 bundles of bleach, 10 bundles of detergent, 3 demijohns of oil, 2 boxes of tomatoes, 5 boxes of soup, 2 quintales of sugar, 3 bundles of toilet paper, 1 bundle of disposable plates, 3 shelves, 10 cartons of eggs, 2 quintales of salt, 1 box of toothpaste, 2 boxes of noodles, and ice cube trays.  She also wants to improve her store premises.  \r\n\r\nThe loan will supply her with what she needs and will help her to be able to improve her store.  There are many products that customers ask for that she does not have.  With the loan, she will be able to provide a better service to her clients.  She will be able to make better profits and to offer a greater quality of life to her family.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a house made of brick.  The house she currently has is made of adobe.  She also dreams of having a mini supermarket, and of having a car in order to transport her products from the store."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1399879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to restock her store, and to also improve her premises.

She sells soft drinks and iced lollipops made with regional fruit such as custard apple, moriche palm fruit, green bananas, passion fruit, and pineapple. To make her wares, she has a fridge she bought with her savings, where she keeps all her products at low temperatures so as to always have refreshing and tasty items for the customers. In the morning, Sadith makes everything she needs, using good-quality fruit, and goes out in the afternoon with a cooler to sell her wares in parks or in front of schools in her vicinity. She started this business two years ago and has always worked alone. Fortunately, she manages to sell most of her production on the same day she makes it. She loves her business because she feels that her hard work is finally paying off. She considers herself successful, since sales and profits are good, and the business grows a bit more every day. In time, she hopes to have a shop of her own, where she could stay instead of having to go out to sell her wares. Sadith asks for a loan of 1,500 soles, and says she is deeply moved by the fact that there are people ready to help her make her business grow, which is why she vows to always be punctual in her repayments and to use the money responsibly. Thus, the whole sum will go toward buying the ingredients she needs to make her delicious drinks and lollipops, such as sugar and regional fruit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1401643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients such as sugar and regional fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-01T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-31T13:40:04Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sadith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":233.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":237.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":236.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":255.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":265.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":271.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.51,"local_amount":233.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":238.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865079},{"amount":87.2,"local_amount":237.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":242.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353445},{"amount":86.88,"local_amount":236.92,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:22Z","rounded_local_amount":241.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905209},{"amount":93.69,"local_amount":255.54,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-10T10:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":260.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091204},{"amount":97.2,"local_amount":265.07,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":270.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777807},{"amount":99.52,"local_amount":271.43,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":277.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598182}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T09:54:50Z","paid_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":588323,"name":"Petrit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petrit is requesting a loan of 250,000 Albanian Lek in order to invest in dairy cows.

The family lives together in their own house. Alva makes a living producing clothes for men, women and children, having learned the trade at an education centre.  To start the business, Alva used her savings to buy a sewing machine.  It is now installed in her home, where her customers come to order each clothing item.  Alva has become accepted by regular customers, who recommend her services to other people.  Alva started this work two years ago and, up until now, she has been working alone.  Alva believes that her work is profitable because the money she earns allow her to support her husband with household costs.  Alva tells us that she sometimes finds the work physically tiring as she spends many hours seated.  In spite of this, though, she does not feel discouraged and continues working and putting in a lot of effort.  Alva plans to continue with her work and to buy other sewing machines in order to give a better finish to her clothes.  On this occasion Alva is applying for a loan of 3000 Nuevo Soles.  She is very excited to learn that there are people out there that can provide her with financial support in order to continue with her work.  Alva promises to be punctual and responsible with her repayments.\r\n\r\nAlva will use this loan to buy material, threads, needles, buttons, blond lace, elastic and other materials that she needs for her customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1401648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy material, thread, needles, buttons, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-01T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-31T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":469.61},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":474.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":473.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":510.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":529.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":542.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":172.19,"local_amount":469.61,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":479.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865080},{"amount":174.16,"local_amount":474.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":485.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353446},{"amount":173.48,"local_amount":473.15,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":483.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905210},{"amount":187.13,"local_amount":510.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-11T10:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":521.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091205},{"amount":393.04,"local_amount":1071.94,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1094.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598183}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T16:28:24Z","paid_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":590590,"name":"Deisy Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Deisy, se le presenta la necesidad de optar por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo porque requiere de m\u00e1s capital de trabajo para continuar en su negocio de venta de sorbetes de la never\u00eda; esta inversi\u00f3n le ayudara a  comprar mercader\u00eda tales como: sorbetes, paletas, conos, siberianos, entre otros.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo anterior le ayudo a incrementar la clientela y sus ganancias las invierte en los gastos b\u00e1sicos del hogar.

Set up to help girls and women deal with their period in a dignified, affordable way, the company was distinctive in that it manufactures reusable sanitary pads in Uganda rather than importing them.  \n\nCurrently, AFRIpads employs over 40 local Ugandan women from rural areas who are pivotal both in the manufacturing process, and ultimately responding to the needs of girls who could not afford sanitary pads and were missing school during their periods. \n\nThese women live in a small village called Kitengeesa about 3 hours\u2019 drive from Kampala, which is off-grid with only basic facilities. With no access to power, they risk respiratory problems, fires and burns by depending on kerosene lamps for lighting in their homes and have to pay for their mobile phones to be charged which is a high cost luxury for them given the limited power supply.\n\nAFRIpads approached Fenix International, a renewable energy company, to help provide their employees with access to clean, safe and affordable lighting plus empower them to generate additional income from phone charging. Fenix designs and manufacturers the ReadySet Solar Charger, a high quality, easy to use solar system that comes with a 15watt solar panel and provides up to 30 hours of lighting or charge up to 10 phones a day. The ReadySet allows a household to generate income of up to $50 per month by charging phones and generating savings by removing the need to purchase kerosene. They ReadySet is also capable of providing reliable energy to power other devices such as radios and hair clippers. \n\nGorreth, an AFRIpad employee (pictured with her light and also shown with her fellow employees), has been testing the ReadySet Solar Charger in her small shop in the village, which she runs next to her AFRIpads job. With the new light, she has been able to keep her shop open for longer in the evening, helping her sell even more products plus she now makes additional income from offering phone charging to the village community for a small fee. She lives in her shop as well and having a light will make her life safer, so much so, she wants to buy one for her parents as well. \n\nThanks to Kiva, Fenix will be able to supply their ReadySet Solar Charger on loan to AFRIpads\u2019 employees, who can pay on affordable monthly installments over a year-long period. Payments are deducted directly from their pay slips each month, leaving them with profits and savings generated from the ReadySet Solar Charger to help improve their lives.

He lives with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and an infant granddaughter. He has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, as his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. Emzar works hard on his family-owned dairy farm with a milk cow. They milk it and produce cheese. In addition, he grows citrus on the agricultural land. Emzar always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. In addition, Emzar is a mini-bus driver and transports passengers from his village to the district. He works hard but the existing income is not enough to cover the food and everyday expenses for his five-member family. That\u2019s why Emzar decided to start a greenhouse and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of economic conditions. The startup program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables vulnerable poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

Her husband works selling natural medicines. He has been doing this work for many years, so he has steady customers. Ana is requesting a loan from FUSAI so that she can have the money she needs to purchase sheet metal roofing and strengthen the roof structure with new beams. \r\n\r\nThe present porch area has many leaks, and it is here that she keeps the chickens and eggs she sells and where she also stores other household utensils.

","en":"Ever since he was a child, Mansurjon has dreamed of receiving a higher education.  He did well in high school, but after graduation he didn't get a chance to go to university and continue his studies.  He began to work and help his parents.  After Mansurjon married, he needed to start earning more money, so he started his own taxi business.  He has been involved in this business for more than four years.  He takes passengers from one region to the other.  He is increasing his business little by little.

The children are still small and his wife takes care of them because there is nowhere for her to work.  For more than five years, Mirolim has been running his own business.  Since he lives in a village, is it very convenient for him to get into the agricultural work.  He mainly grows watermelon on .5 hectares of land and maize on .4 hectares.  He already has enough experience to increase his business.  Since he is the primary breadwinner in his family, Mirolim needs to increase his business to receive a higher income.  In order for this to happen, he needs to receive a good crop, and in order to receive a good crop he needs to fertilize his land.  At the moment, he doesn't have enough money to buy mineral fertilizer, so he is asking for a loan of 1,000 somoni to buy the fertilizer.  He is awaiting your

His wife, Guloim, is a kind and hard-working woman and she always supports her husband in everything he does.  For more than five years, Arbobhudoyor has been involved in raising animals.  At the moment, he has two cows to his name.  He doesn't have any other income and he barely earns enough to provide for his family.  He gave much thought to starting a new business in buying and selling industrial goods, but since he lives in a village it would make more sense for him to increase his livestock business than to go down another business route.  He is asking for a loan of 5,000 somoni to buy cows.  He is awaiting your kindness.  This loan will help Arbobhudoyor increase his working capital and in turn increase his income.  He plans to use the money from this loan to buy his children some quality food to eat and to pay for their education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1397399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Khojmahmad is 54 years old and he is married with a large family.  He is the father of seven children - six daughters and one son.  He has a higher education and for a few years he has worked in a government office of his district, a \"djamoat\" (from the Arabic \"djamaa\" - society, group, community).  Every village in the region has a djamoat (smaller regions), and the djamoats are in the villages.\r\n\r\nKhojmahmad is also involved in agricultural work.  He has a private farm, a \"dekhkanskoe,\" where his wife helps him grow his crops.  A dekhkanskoe is a small, individual or collective private farm on which a few people work and where the main crops grown are cotton, wheat or vegetables - these occupy about 60% of the irrigated land in Tajikistan.\r\n\r\nKhojmahmad combines his work at the djamoat with his agricultural work.  Neither one are enough to feed his whole family.  He has been involved in farming for more than 20 years.  He learned all about it from his father.  Khojmahmad is asking for a loan to buy mineral fertilizer so he can receive a rich harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1397281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy mineral fertilizer to receive a rich harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-08-02T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-01T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khojmahmad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":143.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":142.8,"local_amount":142.8,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":142.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449682880},{"amount":142.8,"local_amount":142.8,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":142.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459152594},{"amount":142.8,"local_amount":142.8,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":142.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467968776},{"amount":142.8,"local_amount":142.8,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":142.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479189080},{"amount":142.8,"local_amount":142.8,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":142.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490882475},{"amount":142.8,"local_amount":142.8,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":142.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504309545},{"amount":143.2,"local_amount":143.2,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":143.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517591372}],"funded_date":"2013-09-01T04:22:47Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T14:25:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":588839,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francisca is a widow and has ten children.

secure future for their family. They formed a group named Mahaveer Self Help Group. The members of Mahaveer Self Help Group are all women from a district of Khurda in Odisha, India. One of them is Mrs. Rinalata, who was selected as their president. The lady standing third from right hand side in the photo is Rinalata.\r\n\r\nRinalata is 31 years old and is staying with her husband. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in the activity of cultivation for a long time. She got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband. She gathered some other women from her neighbourhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. Initially she started with growing only a few vegetables, such as potatos, tomatoes and onions, but later on she grew bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumbers, lady finger [okra] and brinjal (eggplant).
