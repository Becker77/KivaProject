It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They received their house from the government and when they got it, it was very small and basic.  Roberto has been improving the house as, in this way, he knows that if some day he were to be parted from his family, they would have a safe home in which to live.  He would now like to build a room on the lower floor of his house in order to extend his living room \/ dining room and thereby have more space.  In order to do this, he would like to buy materials such as cement, sand and metal rods, and pay a builder."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":898638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy cement and sand, and to pay labor costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-10-19T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5247.53,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":722.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":777.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":836.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":900.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":968.39},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.1},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.77},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.1,"local_amount":722.91,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":742.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244539522},{"amount":59.28,"local_amount":777.74,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-16T08:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":799.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250750173},{"amount":63.77,"local_amount":836.52,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":859.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257392161},{"amount":68.62,"local_amount":900.12,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":925.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263704573},{"amount":153.23,"local_amount":2010.24,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2066.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270008793}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T19:46:56Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:57:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":352486,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefina is 57 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She lives in Kitengela township near Athi - River one of the peri-urban towns of Nairobi. Ndumi also takes care of her younger sister aged 30 years who is HIV positive and is on anti-retroviral treatment. Ndumi also takes care of another sister who is asthmatic, and therefore cannot work effectively. Ndumi is also responsible for the upkeep of her sisters\u2019 children. True to her Christian calling, Ndumi devotes some of her free time visiting people who are HIV positive and the disadvantaged people in Kitengela Township. During such visits, she takes to them foodstuff and clothes. \r\n\r\nNdumi started her tailoring business in the year 1997. This was after she finished her tailoring course, which was conducted by the Singer company. Before that, she used to sell vegetables while at the same time making mandazi (a doughnut-like bun). Her mandazi\u2019s were well sought after because they were delicious and she cooked them in a clean environment. Through the sale of mandazi and vegetables she managed to raise Ksh 32,000 (USD 490). \r\n\r\nWith this money Ndumi bought a sewing machine and various types of tailoring materials. She then rented a stall in Kitengela where she is operating today.

He generally plants citrus fruits (oranges, mandarins). The most profitable months are from January to March, because this is the summer season in the city of Lima, where he sends his products.

They are also responsible for caring of his old parents. Erali is a farmer. Recognized by the people of the neighborhood as a serious man, Erali would like to expand his crop into a viable source of income. In order to do that, he needs a loan of 3000 Somoni to buy seeds and fertilizer so as to expand his crop. The income from it will then help him to cope with the needs of his large family and educate all his children. Erali is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan.  \n \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mae is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mae joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Mae is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional goods for sale. This loan will be the second loan she has taken out from GDMPC.

At first all of his earnings went to pay for the education of his children. However, now the profits he earns are used to cover domestic necessities and to save so that in the future he can convert his business to the production of root vegetables and peas, products that are in high demand.  In addition, he will cultivate in greater quantity so that he can have a higher income, which will allow him to provide an adequate quality of life for his family.\r\n\r\nThis is his 2nd loan with MFP, and he knows that if he wants to continue to access credit he must be on time with every payment.  At the same time, he is pleased to work with his communal bank because the members are demanding and always recommend that the money be spent wisely.

Josefina has ten children, all of whom depend on her.

With it she was able to start a business selling women's wraps. Previously she only sold fish for lack of capital. But now she sells blankets and  wraps every Saturday and Sunday in the city of La Paz, Bolivia. She is able to, in part, cover her children's and grandson's basic needs.  Her grand son is seven years old. \r\n\r\nShe requests a new loan in the amount of 1000 nuevos soles to purchase more pashmina wraps. Her vision is to keep advancing in her business selling pashmina wraps.

Voaesea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 WST from SPBD, which she used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles and thread. Voaesea is now requesting her second loan, in the amount of 1500 WST,  to purchase a new sewing machine.

She enjoys a strong reputation in the business and receives a lot of orders especially in winter, but her resources do not allow her to honor them.\r\n\r\nTherefore she decided about a year ago to integrate the Soro Yiriwaso credit loan program, where she is on her second individual loan. The previous loan was successfully repaid in full.\r\n\r\nWith this second loan she plans to purchase from wholesalers three bales of used clothing of different qualities (sweaters, T-shirts, shirts, socks, pants). She resells them as an itinerant vendor to a client base consisting of heads of households from her area.\r\n\r\nShe expects this loan will generate monthly profits of 170,000 FCFA that will be used primarily to increase her business, contribute towards family expenses, and pay interest on the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":941206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buy bales of used clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-12-11T05:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadidiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874428},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283254},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424765},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140029},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-27T08:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757004},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-22T08:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251767},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410774},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448948},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502717},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268396}],"funded_date":"2011-12-18T02:03:00Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":372990,"name":"Ajelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ajelina is a 40-year-old married woman with three children, all of whom are in school.

Since this business is going well, he wants to sell his coal door-to-door, so he decided to ask for a loan to buy a cart in order to carry his coal to sell. His wife, Mrs. Tes Saran, is a housewife who cooks delicious food for her family.

Fifteen members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These clients are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

Chinbat is 41 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Harhorin, the capital city of the ancient Mongolian empire. He and his family live in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His son and two daughters attend a local secondary school. \r\n<p>\r\nChinbat operates a raw material trading business in his town. He sells animal skins, primarily sheep and goat skins. He started his business in 1999 after previously working as a driver for a state-owned farm. Over the years, Chinbat has become quite experienced in raw materials trading and has built a stable operation. He is now planning to expand his business in the near future. Chinbat's business is very important to him and his family. He says, \"All I want is to provide for my children's education and raise them to be good people.\" He is requesting a 1,000,000 MNT loan to purchase sheep and goat skins to sell for his business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About XacBank<\/b><br>\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Mercedes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Mercedes is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 6th loan from ASKI.

To make a living, Flordeliza owns & operates a general store selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Flordeliza is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Flordeliza joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flordeliza is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Flordeliza from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L\u00facia lives in her own house with her family and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nL\u00facia became pregnant in sixth grade and quit school.  After the birth of her child, L\u00facia continued to live in her parents' house, and they took care of her during the most difficult time of her life.  Some years later, she returned to school and finished tenth grade.  After that, she immediately took a teaching course in Namaacha District, which is on the border with Swaziland.\r\n\r\nShe quit the class when she got together with her current husband, who gave her the money to start her own business selling pots which she buys in Maputo and resells in Swaziland.  She still does this work on Wednesdays and Saturdays at the open-air market.  L\u00facia earns about 6,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also manages to save some money with the help of the vegetable garden in her yard, where she grows lettuce and cabbage.\r\n\r\nThis is L\u00facia's seventh loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.  The first six loans were for 5,000 meticais, 5,000 meticais, 12,000 meticais, 10,000 meticais, 10,000 meticais and 10,000 meticais.  They were used to increase her inventory, and she paid them back with no problems.  She is now asking for 12,000 meticais for the same purpose.

A local orchid society, for example, found that their plants responded better to harvested rain water than to tap water, which has been treated with chlorine. Local wineries big and small have also come to Aaron for barrels to store their harvested grapes. \r\n \r\nSince starting his business four years ago, Aaron has seen demand for his barrels rise steadily. While Aaron admits that running a business comes with its own set of challenges, the ability to determine his own schedule is indispensable because he has spent the last fifteen years helping to care for sick and elderly family members. \r\n \r\nA $4,000 loan, his third from Opportunity Fund, will help Aaron secure a new location for his operations, as well as increase his inventory of supplies. As the autumn harvest and winter rainy season approach, his busiest times of the year, Aaron is excited to get the business running at full capacity in a new space. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d like to find

He is 32 years old. Jovinsol is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJovinsol is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Jovinsol owns & operates a business venture making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fish balls and other dimsums to the local community. Jovinsol has been engaged in his business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovinsol joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovinsol has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovinsol is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jovinsol from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":644174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase new items to expand product offering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

Forced to abandon his studies due to lack of support, he then learned about ironwork, electricity, and arc welding. His own personal effort led him to open his workshop, which he manages rigorously. Based on the quality of his services, his work is increasingly sought after, but his means are too limited to respond promptly to his customers\u2019 requests. He therefore asked for a loan of $850 which he managed well and repaid without incident, reinforcing his credibility and increasing his clientele. Today he faces a constantly increasing demand which he is unable to satisfy due to a lack of machines and other materials. The small size of his workshop is also a handicap for the growth of his business. \r\n\r\n<p>Thus, to enlarge his business and provide quality service to his clientele and attract more regular customers, Mr. Kossi Mathieu G. is asking for a loan of $2000 to buy a machine and to rent a more spacious location for his workshop.

Currently all her children are in school. She lives at Suhum in the eastern region of Ghana. She is a petty trader who sells assorted products like cooking utensils and plastic bowls, lunch boxes, etc. She mostly sells through hawking, that is, house-to-house selling. She has been selling goods for eight year now. <P>\r\n\r\nComfort has attracted lots of customers who purchase from her. She treks to Accra to purchase her stock of goods. Recently she has been facing challenges in her business as a result of inadequate funds to buy stock.

To make a living, Julie operates a store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Julie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Julie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the first loan taken out by Julie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

The official name of this borrowing group is Lily J..\r\n\r\nLily is 53 years old and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Lily owns and operates a general store, selling both food and daily use products in the local community.

Lily has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. That loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lily is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be her 6th loan from ASKI.

He lives in the Darsalam II district of the city of Koutiala (in the region of Sikasso).  \r\nBecause of family circumstances, Hamidou did not get the chance to study.  That is why this adventurous member of the Dogon tribe began work as a caretaker and, with his earnings, took the initiative to enter into money-making ventures.  He has been selling beverages at a cultural center in Koutiala for three years.  The work he does is very profitable because he sells many cases of drinks per day. \r\nIn order to increase his working capital, Mr. T. has partnered with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso for two years.

She now lives with her new partner in her own home.\r\n\r\nFor more than 10 years, Teva has been growing pasture which serves as fodder for her animals which include cows and bulls that she keeps in her cow shed.  She also grows potatoes and quinoa: products which are in great demand in the market.  For this reason, she sells these products wholesale.\r\n\r\nTeva invests most of her time in raising her cattle.  She feeds her cows and sells their milk.  Once her bulls have grown strong, she shows them at the cattle market in her town.  She does all this so that she can support her family and provide for her children's well-being.  She feels proud because during  the years since her husband passed away, she has supported her household single-handedly.\r\n\r\nTeva will currently concentrate her efforts on buying more animals to increase her working capital.

<p>Carlos and his wife Ingrid have a small farm in Santa Lucia province in Ecuador. Carlos has been living on this land for about 30 years, since it was given to him by his father. Because he only has an elementary education, Carlos wants to provide something more for his 4 year-old son. He relies on the income for his rice farming to feed his family and pay for all the household expenses. He has also been raising cattle for several years as a secondary source of income. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p> Carlos is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

Inomjon has dedicated much effort to the business of agriculture for 18 years already.  He has 0.8 hectares of land where produces different kinds of vegetables.  He also has a lot of apricot trees on his land. \r\n\r\nHe gets a rich harvest every year from his land.  From the savings of his land he could arrange the weddings of his two children.  He also plants different kinds of feeds for animals such as corn, hay, etc.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Inomjon is asking for a loan of 4000 Somoni ($1200 USD) in order to purchase fuels and lubricants, mineral fertilizer and also saplings for expanding his fruit garden.  Inomjon is very confident that he will be awarded this loan and assures you that the money will be repaid in time with no violations. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 35-year-old Rehema C. from Mbarali. She is single with two children, between the ages of 12 and 16. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents died of HIV. \r\n<p>\r\nRehema has been selling rice and mobile credit cards since 2000. She buys rice at wholesale prices from farmers and mobile credit cards at wholesale to sell at retail prices.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works at her business for 9&ndash;12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Rehema currently earns about $460 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $1150 USD in order to purchase more rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Rehema thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

She lives in the district Predios del Recreo, where she has lived for 9 years.  She has many regular customers since the type of products she sells for the most part only last for one month of use.  Almost every month the same customers return to buy various items from her.  Mar\u00eda now needs a loan in order to purchase bikinis, bloomers, socks, underwear, brassieres, and stockings for her to sell.  Mar\u00eda travels to El Salvador once a month to buy her merchandise, as the goods there are much cheaper and of a quality acceptable to her customers.  In the same spirit of hard work, Mar\u00eda turns herself into a chef on the weekends, making nacatamales, which she sells on Friday nights from 4-10pm, and on Saturday mornings from 8-11am.  Mar\u00eda is very motivated to succeed, and she tells us that she feels very happy because things have been going well for her, and she hopes that they will continue to improve even more.  It is very pleasant to chat with Mar\u00eda.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":402414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"compra de cremas, shampoos, acondicionadores, lapices labiales, productos por catalogo, jeans, camisetas, blusas, batidoras electricas, tintes para cabello","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tegucigalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.1 -87.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-10-08T22:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863383},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753070},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123979529},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010524},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734890},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768361},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152085836},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799709},{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5315.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166904896}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T00:06:38Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:53:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":146877,"name":"Habi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M. is a 47 year old widower who lives with his three children, aged 19, 17, and 11, in the Bayan-Ulgii province of western Mongolia.

Now she is two years in this business and she is very happy that she can earn from what she enjoys.\r\n\r\nGulzar applied for a loan to purchase more seeds and flowerpots to raise her beautiful flowers, and she hopes she can increase her monthly turnover with this loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":742543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase seeds and flowerpots","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Agsu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.5 48.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2011-03-31T13:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.43},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":841.68,"local_amount":666.68,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":667.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226983316},{"amount":420.85,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":333.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232742502},{"amount":210.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":166.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238547069},{"amount":210.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":166.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244506608},{"amount":210.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":166.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250714111},{"amount":210.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":166.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257117030},{"amount":210.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":166.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263242133},{"amount":210.37,"local_amount":166.63,"processed_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":166.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269967121}],"funded_date":"2011-04-03T01:16:45Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:25:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":291049,"name":"Mirasol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mirasol is married with four children, and works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a tricycle transport business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from ready-to-wear clothing.

His wife is a farmer and they have a son aged one, to whom they hope to give a good education up to university level. \r\n<br>Paul's business is located at the busy Juakali Market in Nairobi. He makes and sells items such as steel doors, metal boxes and cookers. He serves the local people. He has been in this business for five years now.

Al estar consiente de la necesidad de trabajo y por ser una dama soltera decide solicitar prestamos en Ceprodel que hasta el momento le han beneficiado con la adquisici\u00f3n de un propio local en las afueras del mercado Central y a la vez le ha ayudado para llevar el alimento a su querida madre.\r\n<\/div>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":116590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of merchandise for her business (flip-flops and sandals)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2008-01-18T01:55:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-01T02:48:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":240,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":60.48,"processed_date":"2008-03-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":146697},{"amount":63,"local_amount":60.48,"processed_date":"2008-04-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170910},{"amount":63,"local_amount":60.48,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":198018},{"amount":61,"local_amount":58.56,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225005}],"funded_date":"2008-01-18T02:48:36Z","paid_date":"2008-06-01T09:12:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":36175,"name":"Roberta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ramona R. de Mancuello is married and is the mother of five children.

She is 51 years old and is a widow.\r\n\r\nBaktygul sells clothes and her elder sons help her with her business. She started selling clothes seven years ago when she rented a small shop with the help of a loan of 10,000 TJS from Kiva partner, Mol Bulak Finance. Now, she earns 12,000 TJS.\r\n\r\nWith the help of a loan, Baktygul was able to purchase a truck and furniture for her house. Also, she was able to increase her turnover. However, she wishes to increase her business further and this is why she applied for a loan.\r\n\r\nWith the loan Baktygul wants to purchase school uniforms and start a wholesale trade. In the future, she plans to reinvest all her profits in her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the other group members:\r\n\r\nGulmira T. is treasurer of the group.

She started selling fish with an initial investment of 360 soms and now she earns 3,000 soms. She has a significant number of patrons and she is able to form very friendly relationships with them. Recently, one of her children was married and Kanymbiubiu therefore spent the most part of her money. Now, she needs some money to continue her business and so she is applying for a loan in order to increase her turnover. In the near future, she is planning to reinvest most part of her profits in her business and also raise her children.\r\n\r\nKulnara D. is forty-five and married.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Pacita has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Pacita joined Kiva's partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Pacita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to buy additional products to sell. Pacita is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase more products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Pacita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
