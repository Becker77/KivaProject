She and her husband have three children, two of whom are dependents and still in school. She has been working in a garment factory for 18 years, while her husband is a motor-taxi driver. With her current work, she is able to earn approximately 14,000 KHR (Cambodian riels) per day to support her family. \r\n\r\nSokhoern has been with VisionFund for seven loan cycles and completely paid back the past loans, which have helped her better support her family with enough food. Now, she is leading her group to apply for a loan. As the leader, Sokhoern will use her portion to buy materials to construct a decent latrine. She will need cement, bricks, a latrine pan, etc. She hopes that this loan will enable her family to have a clean latrine for daily use so as to improve to a healthier standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1398510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She has a son, daughter-in-law, and grandson, with whom she lives in the Khuroson Khatlon region of Tajikistan. \r\n\r\nZeboniso wants to start her own business. She has five years experience in trade. Previously, she worked as a salesclerk in store. Now, she intends to open her own grocery store. Next to her home, Zeboniso has built a construction for a store. Left to her now is only to purchase goods and to start the business. To that end, Zeboniso requested a loan. With the loan, she wants to buy a diverse assortment of food products, specifically butter, sugar, tea, cookies, chocolate, pasta, sausage products, dairy products, etc. \r\n\r\nShe believes that her business will be quite successful as there is not in their area such a big grocery store that offers so much variety. And besides that, Zeboniso will bring only quality and fresh products. Zeboniso knows that her goal will be realized only with

She is married and is raising three children. Her husband is engaged in agriculture and receives a small income. This income is not sufficient to support the family with all its needs. \r\n\r\nRavshanoy decided to help her husband for the well-being of the family. To this end, she took a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate. Now, she is fully capable of establishing her own business and becoming successful in this sphere. She wants to organize a business buying and selling livestock, as she has experience in this type of work. From the income received, she plans to provide her children with a good education and nutritious food.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of USD $400 to buy livestock in order to establish a new

For many years, Zuurakhan has been involved in agriculture and raising livestock, starting this business with a sum of 3,000 som (KGS). Monthly income from livestock is 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to hard work, Zuurakhan today has on her homestead: 1 dairy cow, 1 calf, 5 sheep, and 6 goats. Her spouse helps with the farm. Her son is working abroad in Russia. He helps his parents materially, sending them his salary. Zuurakhan also has her own retail outlet where she sells food products. This brings about 20,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her homestead, Zuurakhan turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow for fattening and

The two other children are in school and help their parents around the house and in their work. \r\n\r\nFor 15 years already, Mahmadrajab has been involved in the fattening and slaughter of cattle. This is his main activity, which brings him a good steady income. Mahmadrajab buys calves in the market for a low price, then grows and fattens them, then resells them at a higher price. \r\n\r\nHis wife helps him with this work. She takes care of the cattle and sells milk obtained from the cattle. She also produces from the milk yogurt products for sale. They work hard in order to become financially successful and to generate a steady income for the family. \r\n\r\nNow, Mahmadrajab wishes to expand the number of his cattle and to maximize his business. For this, he turned to Arvand and wants to get a loan to buy cattle. He thanks Arvand in advance for the financial support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1397547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gissar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.524722 68.551389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-02T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-01T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahmadragab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":136.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":139.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":142.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":145.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":149.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":152.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":156.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":159.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":163.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":170.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":174.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":178.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":182.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":187.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":191.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":195.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":205.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.81},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":591075,"name":"Esperanza Y Progreso De Huaycan Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Alcanc\u00eda Comunal \u201cEsperanza y Progreso De Huaycan\u201d  es un grupo din\u00e1mico la cual la integra 08 socios, siendo la gran mayor\u00eda de ellos vecinos de la zona.

For the past 10 years, she has been running a shop where she sells soft drinks, fry sausage, plantains, fish, etc. She started this business with money from her husband's earnings. She managed to establish this business, and learned ways of selling from her friends. She is very happy with her business because she meets new people every day and it keeps her busy. Most interestingly, she learned those different kinds of local languages. She is requesting a loan to buy soft drinks, fry sausage, plantains, fish, etc. for her business.

He is married and lives in Livingstone, Zambia. He runs a mobile money transfer business at the Kazungula border.  \r\n\r\nThis is Henry\u2019s second loan; he has finished paying off his first loan, which helped him grow his business by increasing his working capital. He says he was able to serve even more customers. Henry explains that doing business at a border town requires a lot of working capital as most of his customers are in transit and need huge amounts of money to clear their goods. Henry is taking out another loan so that he can continue his business\u2019s growth and so that he is not limited as to how many people he can serve in a day.  \r\n\r\nHenry is hopeful that once the Kiva loan comes in, he will be able to serve his customers much faster and earn more profits.

Her husband works as a farmer. The proceeds from her business normally go towards helping her husband cover the family\u2019s general expenses and pay their children\u2019s school fees. Araba wants to use her loan to purchase a greater quantity of cassava and maize, thus increasing her current inventory levels. As a result, this will allow her to sell greater quantities of her tasty \u2018Banku\u2019. In the long term, Araba plans to reinvest the future profits back into her business, thus helping her expand and meet the needs of rising customer demands."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1398703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a greater quantity of cassava and maize, thus increasing her current inventory levels.

Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1398753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-08-03T05:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-02T05:30:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nirmala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3583.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400621704},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410196587},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419960036},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429613929},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840391},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:59:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449730328},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459209709},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-21T09:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468029533},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-21T09:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479253008},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-22T09:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490949346},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":1666.63,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504387957}],"funded_date":"2013-08-03T07:23:22Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T17:20:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":589070,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a young lady, aged 28, who is married with three children.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

In the future, Kanchi plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

Kasifa grew up with her grandmother, because her mother and father were still in school when they gave birth to her, and her father had no source of income. All of her needs were catered for by her grandmother who was a peasant, although she could not afford school fees for her. Kasifa then dropped out of school to help her grandmother in her restaurant.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that she was bright, Kasifa also learnt the business and ended up starting her own restaurant. She later got a loan of 1,000,000 from Ugafode Micro finance which helped her business to grow further. This loan was repaid very well, and she is now requesting a loan of 2,500,000 to complete her

One morning, while walking aimlessly, a man called out to me and asked me to buy him food and some wood sanding discs. When I returned, he wanted to pay for my services. I politely and humbly declined but on his insistence, I accepted a plate of cooked rice and beans. His show of love and appreciation endeared him to me, to the extent that I became his errand boy. With time, a friendship developed and I became fascinated with his craft... he was a wood carver. He trained me well and eventually I became a carver in my own right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank God for bringing Novica to Ghana, and may God bless the people who are funding my microcredit. It is really helping me to produce more and thus earn more money to pay my children's school fees. My heartfelt thanks to you all.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link to view Abdul's hand-carved African masks and sculptures on the NOVICA site: http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/3754"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1398878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to stock up on wood, metal plates, polish and paint to continue production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Accra","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.55 -0.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2013-08-03T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-02T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":12,"local_amount":12,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T17:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410186689},{"amount":43.05,"local_amount":43.05,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T19:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":43.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419949312},{"amount":34.5,"local_amount":34.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":34.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602122},{"amount":27,"local_amount":27,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829170},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449718812},{"amount":151.1,"local_amount":151.1,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":151.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459197585},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T15:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468016932},{"amount":125.85,"local_amount":125.85,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T17:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":125.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240257}],"funded_date":"2013-08-04T04:50:47Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T17:01:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":6,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":589107,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel is a Ghanaian artisan who specializes in carvings and authentic African masks.

Ebel is looking for a microloan to fund its clothing inventory. \r\n\r\nEbel's narrative on his background:\r\n\"I was born to hard working parents, my father a mechanic and mother, a seamstress. The family migrated to Los Angeles, California, in the early 80's. In the US, my father continued to work as a mechanic. My mother opened her start up apparel manufacturer as a sub-contractor, doing work to various brands. \r\n\r\nIn late 1990, I was exposed to a brand new genre of music named Reggaeton (a mixture of tropical beats with rap lyrics).  I noticed that this music united Hispanics from different countries together. No other music genre had done [this] before. I envisioned a brand which caters to Americans of Latin American decents and Latin worldwide. Since, I am a proud owner of the trademarked Dog log and the registered Reggaeton\u00ae brand. I have established connections in the music industry that I [hope will be] extremely helpful to market my brand. I have a strong following from young millenniums. I hope to see my apparel designs in major retail stores across the United States and the world. We are the brand of the future.\""}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1396007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He is happy doing this work and feels that things are going well due to the friendly way he treats others. \r\n\r\nJuan is very thankful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to their support he can buy surgical supplies to treat animals. Also Juan will buy construction materials to fix the front of his animal hospital. By doing this he can offer better service and take care of more patients. He can continue to work and strive to fulfill his dream of having a large veterinary practice.\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1177127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Veterinary Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy surgical and construction materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-08-03T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-02T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":266.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":276.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":292.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":298.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":314.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":322.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":335.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":355.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":362.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":377.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":391},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":406.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96.61,"local_amount":266.52,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":270.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779426},{"amount":100.35,"local_amount":276.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":280.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054621},{"amount":105.86,"local_amount":292.01,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":295.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819519},{"amount":108.37,"local_amount":298.95,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":303,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472457},{"amount":113.91,"local_amount":314.24,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":318.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694935},{"amount":117.01,"local_amount":322.79,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":327.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450390967},{"amount":121.57,"local_amount":335.35,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":339.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067466},{"amount":128.91,"local_amount":355.64,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":360.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880383},{"amount":557.41,"local_amount":1537.67,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1558.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479103943}],"funded_date":"2013-08-04T12:10:53Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T10:23:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":589237,"name":"Charito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charito has been managing his farming business for 10 years now, a skill he acquired from his father, who is also a farmer.

Con el paso de los a\u00f1os y el trabajo que realizaba logr\u00f3 comprar otro terreno de una hect\u00e1rea donde ampli\u00f3 su producci\u00f3n de cacao y barbasco esperando mejorar sus ingresos, siendo este una buena inversi\u00f3n que plane\u00f3. Todos los d\u00edas debe dirigirse a sus terrenos desde muy temprano junto a su esposo para realizar un mantenimiento a sus plantaciones con la intenci\u00f3n de obtener una buena calidad en los frutos. Durante los a\u00f1os que viene trabajando en el campo as\u00ed como buenos momentos que vive como parte de su rutina diaria tambi\u00e9n ha tenido malas experiencias siendo una de ellas el fracaso de una campa\u00f1a de cultivo por las plagas que aprendi\u00f3 a combatir con la ayuda de su familia. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con Kiva y se siente agradecida por el apoyo financiero que recibe para seguir adelante, adem\u00e1s se compromete a pagar sus cuotas de manera puntual. En esta ocasi\u00f3n desea contar con 500 nuevos soles parla compra de herramientas como machetes, tijeras de podar, serruchos de podar entre otros para renovar las que ya tiene. \n","en":"Claudia is 46 years old. She is married to Hip\u00f3lito and has 2 children who live in their own home. \r\n\r\nClaudia works in agriculture growing organic cocoa, coffee, annattos, and mullein. Her husband helps her along with the children in minor duties. She says that she opted for this work when her parents gave her some land when she had her first child and she had no fixed way to support her family.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of time and through her work she was able to buy another hectare plot of land where she expanded her cocoa and mullein production hoping to improve her income, feeling this would be a good planned investment.\r\n\r\nEvery day from very early she goes to the field with her husband to maintain their farm with the intention of harvesting good quality fruit. During the years that she has been working in the field she has had some good times as it is a part of the daily routine, and she has also had some bad experiences one of them being the damage of a crop due to pests which she learned to fight with the help of her family.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through Kiva and she is grateful for the financial help she is receiving so she can get ahead and she agrees to make her payments on time.\r\n\r\nAt this time she is asking for 500 soles in order to buy tools like machetes, pruning shears, and handsaws, among other items in order to renew the supplies she already has.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1403658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Before his departure, Muzafar gave his trading business to his brother so he would continue the family business in Muzafar's absence.  But when Muzafar returned home, he found out that his brother had gone bankrupt and the whole business had burned down.  Now he wants to start the business back up again.  He has already lived the hard life of a migrant worker and he doesn't plan to leave his home again.  Muzafar has a trading stall in the market from his last business, and he has savings in the amount of 3,000 TJS from his earnings in Russia.  He has asked for a loan so he can buy his goods.  He plans to sell men's clothing again.  With the loan and his savings, he wants to buy an assortment of men's t-shirts and pants and get to work.

mother of five children. She struggles to earn enough for her family's daily food consumption via her sole business of rice farming and pineapple growing. She has been involved in her business for ages, and through it she earns about 34,200 Cambodian riels (KHR) per day.\r\n\r\nThis is not Poeun's first loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

","en":"Doston is 19 years old.  He was born and raised in a family of workers.  His mother Yerkinoy works as head of the Legislative Assembly in their area, and his father a migrant worker in the Russian Federation. Doston has dreamed of becoming a doctor from a young age. He studied hard in middle school and took extra classes in order to have a deeper knowledge of subjects such as mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics. After finishing middle school, he was unable to go to university, and so he entered the preparatory department of the Medical University. Currently, he is a student at the Medical University of Tajikistan and needs to pay his tuition.  His parents did not have the money to pay for his tuition. He has requested a loan in the amount of $1100 U.S. dollars to pay for his tuition. He is awaiting your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1400664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She works from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, and is able to make a very good profit per month. \r\n\r\nThis is her 16th loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. With the previous loans, all of which were paid back successfully, she bought more butcher meat and opened a grocery business, which is run by her daughters. With the profit received, she covered school fees and home expenses, built a house and reinvested in the business.  The remaining amount she decided to save for her future. \r\n\r\nASHA will use this loan to buy a butcher cow and more grocery store drinks to resell.

Estos tipos de abono se pueden aprovechar en cualquier tipo de cultivo, los beneficios es que son de buen calidad, es m\u00e1s saludable, est\u00e1 disponible a todo el p\u00fablico, pero sobretodo es org\u00e1nico a diferencia de los fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos los cuales son malos para la salud y tambi\u00e9n perjudican al medio ambiente. Do\u00f1a Do\u00f1o lleva 14 a\u00f1os con su actividad: \u201cLa inici\u00e9 porque yo vend\u00eda solo el camote del alcatraz amarillo, la vend\u00eda en macetas en los mercados pero tambi\u00e9n inicie con mi negocio por necesidad porque todos mis hijos se encontraban estudiando nuestros gastos eran demasiado de alguna manera ten\u00eda la responsabilidad de ayudar con los gastos del hogar\u201d Ahora Do\u00f1a Domitila se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de flores de varios tipos porque con estas elabora arreglos florales para cual fiesta o evento. Ha recibido  varios cursos de dise\u00f1o floral para poder obtener clientes siempre es contratada para los mejores eventos de su comunidad o de otros lugares. Sin embargo no es la \u00fanica actividad econ\u00f3mica tambi\u00e9n se dedica al cultivo de haba, jitomate, nopales, duraznos.

Do\u00f1a Domi comento \u201cPara poder obtener tantos beneficios de la naturaleza debemos apreciarla  saber amarla\u201d. Ella est\u00e1 muy contenta con todos sus logros, porque adem\u00e1s de todas sus actividades tambi\u00e9n puede dar empleo a otras personas como Don Vicente y Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n quien tambi\u00e9n integran el grupo. En todas las actividades invierten los tres, las ganancias son repartidas entre ellos pero su sueldo es extra. El \u00fanico obst\u00e1culo es la falta de dinero para comprar las cosas necesarias como herramienta, pl\u00e1sticos para invernaderos, m\u00e1quinas etc. Ellos est\u00e1n muy agradecidos con KIVA y VisionFund porque de alguna manera han con tribuido para lograr el \u00e9xito obtenido en sus actividades econ\u00f3micas Do\u00f1a Teresa quien tambi\u00e9n forma parte del grupo ella tambi\u00e9n tiene una peque\u00f1a lumbricaria sin embargo esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para abastecer su tienda de abarrotes.\n","en":"The Toxiflor group is made up of four people, two women and two men. They have a nice friendship and know each other very well. The four of them are very hardworking, but above all very responsible. They have been working with VisionFund for several cycles. They all live in the same community, where most residents work as merchants. They chose the name of the group because three of them work in flower cultivation for floral arrangements.  Domitila,  or Domi,as they affectionately call her, says that she is 48 years old. She has been married to Juan for several years. They don't have any dependent children any more because they have all grown and support themselves. She only went to secondary school but she is a hardworking woman. Her responsibility is what distinguishes her. She works making organic fertilizer. There are two types, solid and liquid. Her fertilizer is produced by raising worms. The process is called lumbricaria. It consists of buying broodstock (large worms), and feeding them  only organic waste from fruit, food and vegetables. That is how the worms start to do their work of transforming the organic residuals into liquid or solid fertilizer. These types of fertilizer can be used on any type of crop. The benefits are that they are good quality, is healthier, and it is available to everyone. Above all, it is organic, different from chemical fertilizers that are unhealthy and hurt the environment. Do\u00f1o has been doing this activity for 14 years. \"I started it because I used to sell yellow lilies. I sold them in flowerpots in the markets but I also started my business out of necessity because all of my children were in school and our expenses were too much. I had the responsibility somehow to help with the household expenses.\u201d Now Domitila works growing flowers of all types because she makes floral arrangements with them for parties or events. She has taken several floral design courses in order to gain customers. She is always hired for the best events in her community or in other places. Nonetheless, this isn't her only economic activity. She also grows beans, tomatoes, nopal cactus and peaches. This time, she is asking for a loan to buy rolls of plastic for her tomato greenhouses. She needs to change some plastic that is in poor condition. All of her crops are grown with the same fertilizer, sometimes liquid and sometimes solid. Domi remarked \u201cTo be able to obtain so much benefit from nature, we have to appreciate it, and know how to love it.\u201d. She is very happy with everything she has achieved, because in addition to all of her activities, she can also provide employment to others such as Vicente and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n, who are also members of the group. All of them invest in all the activities. The profits are divided among the three of them, but her salary is extra. The only obstacle is a lack of money to buy necessary things such as tools, plastic for the greenhouses, machinery, etc. They are very grateful to Kiva and VisionFund because they have contributed to being able to achieve success in her economic activities. Teresa, who is also a part of the group, also has a small  lumbricaria, but she is asking for the loan to stock her grocery store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3975,"image":{"id":1402658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy rolls of plastic for her greenhouses.

su vestimenta muy colorida. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron ellas mismas porque viven muy cerca de un r\u00edo peque\u00f1o. Las personas de esa comunidad utilizan esta agua para usos multiples.

They belong to the same community, which is very beautiful and interesting because it has various festivals all year, and above all because they preserve their culture like their native language and very colorful dress.  They chose the name of the group themselves because they live very close to a small river.  The people in this community use water for multiple uses.  Do\u00f1a Antonia is  member of the group who is thirty-seven  She has been married to Felipe for nineteen years.  He works as a construction worker.  Together, they have formed a family with four children, two of whom are still in school.  Antonia is requesting a loan to buy more chickens.  She buys them when they are very small so she can buy them at a cheaper price.  She grows them and fattens them for awhile and later sells them to her neighbors, usually around the time when a festival occurs.  With her profits, she can buy shoes, clothing, and food for her children.  If she doesn't sell her animals, she prepares them for her family, so they can also save a little money that way.  Antonia told us, while smiling, \"This way we don't spend money and we have something nutritious.  There is nothing better than a good chicken raised at home.\"  The only inconvenience for her is when her chickens get sick and die because there aren't any profits this way.  Nevertheless, she is a very hard-working and positive woman.  She doesn't plan to stop her business because it is a very good activity since she can look after her children.

en una comunidad muy tranquila las personas acostumbran sembrar ma\u00edz como cultivo. Carlos comenta \u201cMe gusta mucho el desfile que celebran en mi comunidad el d\u00eda 16 de septiembre d\u00eda de la independencia de M\u00e9xico, en muchos otros lugares ya no se celebran con esa emoci\u00f3n; aqu\u00ed, si\u201d El nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque lo relacionan con su actividad econ\u00f3mica que es la carpinter\u00eda y un pasaje de la biblia donde nos relata como No\u00e9 salvo a los animales del gran diluvio gracias a un arca de madera. Carlos quien es el representante del grupo tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casado con Guadalupe desde hace ya 13 a\u00f1os juntos han formado una familia con tres ni\u00f1os dos de ellos asisten a la escuela. Carlos desde hace 8 a\u00f1os tiene su propia carpinter\u00eda \u00e9l aprendi\u00f3 el oficio de carpintero gracias a su pap\u00e1. Don Candelario fue quien inici\u00f3 la actividad, Carlos aprendi\u00f3 hacer hacer puertas, mesas, cocinas integrales, sillas, muebles para oficina, etc. Para hacer acabados y barnizados tuvo que tomar algunos cursos, esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para comprar un rauter y un taladro, ya tiene estas herramientas, pero ya tiene mucho tiempo con ellas y necesita cambiarlas. En el negocio de Carlos su \u00fanica dificultad es la falta de espacio, tiene un local en su misma casa y es muy peque\u00f1o para poder trabajar adecuadamente, est\u00e1 obligado a utilizar otros espacios de su casa. Carlos argumenta: \u201cMi meta es llegar a tener una carpinter\u00eda m\u00e1s amplia para poder tener mas clientes y as\u00ed aumentar mis ganancias, lo m\u00e1s importante para m\u00ed, son mis hijos, me gustar\u00eda verlos realizados profesionalmente si yo pude terminar la preparatoria ellos deber\u00e1n estudiar una carrera profesional\u201d. Don Candelario y Do\u00f1a Hermelinda invertir\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n en su carpinter\u00eda. Do\u00f1a Hermelinda se encarga de elaborar los cojines para las sillas de madera.","en":"The Ark Family is made up of Candelario and Hermelinda, who are Carlos's parents. They live in a very peaceful community where people usually grow corn as their main crop. Carlos says \u201cI really like the parade my community puts on to celebrate the 16th September, Mexico\u2019s Independence Day.  In other places they don\u2019t celebrate it with so much excitement anymore, but here we do\u201d.  The family chose the name of their group because it relates to their area of work, which is carpentry. If we take a look at the bible, it tells us how Noah saved the animals from a great flood thanks to a wooden ark.\r\n\r\nCarlos, the representative of the group, is 36 years old and has been married to Guadalupe for 13 years. They have three children, two of whom go to school. Carlos has had his own carpentry business for the last eight years, which he was able to open thanks to his dad, Candelario, who was the one who began the business. Carlos learnt how to make doors, tables, open-plan kitchens, chairs, office furniture, etc. To learn how to finish and varnish furniture he had to take some courses. \r\n\r\nThis time he is applying for a loan to purchase a drill and a router. He already has these tools, but he has had them for a long time and they need changing. The only difficulty in Carlos\u2019s business is the lack of space. He runs a store from his own house and as it is very small, he has had to take over other areas of his house in order to work properly. Carlos explains \u201cmy goal is to have a larger carpentry store so I can receive more customers and increase my income. The most important thing for me is my children.

Marcelino works in agriculture. From a young age he learnt the different necessary techniques to get a good harvest of cocoa beans. Generally, to finish off the routine tasks in his fields, he summons workers in the region to help. Being ex workmates of his, they feel at ease with the work they do, having been able to make a good living out of it previously. Nevertheless he tells us that the final price he was paid for the harvest was lower than usual, which was significantly detrimental to him.  \r\n\r\nMarcelino would like to have enough capital to begin the harvest season with everyone who stands to gain from it. For that to happen he has to have a strong team of workers from the region on hand to weed and get sacks of organic fertiliser for sowing.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Kiva and he is grateful to receive the financial support which allows him to continue with his business.
