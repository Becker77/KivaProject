She lives with her husband and five children in a rural village of the Sangke district. Three of her children are still in school in the area. Rice farming is the only, and main, source of her family\u2019s income and she has been farming rice for about eight years. The current business earns her family a daily income of about 26,000 KHR but she is able to save 6,000 KHR every day. This is the fifth loan for Vanna with VisionFund.

For this reason she will start using fertilizer for this harvest, which takes place every 15 days. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support she is being given to be able to make progress. Ruth will use the 1000 soles to buy organic fertilizer to feed her crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1403823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-04T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-03T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":114.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":119.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":122.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":127.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":131.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":136.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":140.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.4,"local_amount":107.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":113.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865123},{"amount":42.76,"local_amount":114.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":119.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353489},{"amount":44.68,"local_amount":119.14,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":125.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905253},{"amount":45.96,"local_amount":122.56,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":128.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091247},{"amount":47.87,"local_amount":127.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":134.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777843},{"amount":153.33,"local_amount":408.87,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":429.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598220}],"funded_date":"2013-08-04T19:13:58Z","paid_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":591743,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia, de 50 a\u00f1os es una mujer responsable.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

His loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The source of income for the family is the small non-stable revenue earned by Karlo working as an auto mechanic, which is not enough to feed his large family.\r\n\r\nKarlo is requesting a loan from Credo to start the family business and his loan request was approved in the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Angelica is 34 years old and married to a bricklayer assistant. Together they have four children, two of whom are currently enrolled in school. Angelica\u2019s business is selling traditional and used clothing, which she sells door to door as well as from her home. Angelica\u2019s business is doing well, thus she has decided to invest more capital into the business. \r\n\r\nAngelica successfully paid off her first loan and has now applied for a second loan. She is requesting a loan of approximately $320, which she will use to purchase additional merchandise in order to offer a greater variety of products to her customers. Her hope is that in the future she will be able to create a second business. To reach that goal she must grow her revenue from her commerce business and start saving. Her savings combined with Friendship Bridge microloans will help get her second business up and running.\r\n\r\nShe and her colleagues are very excited to be able to have access to funding they would not have without Kiva and Friendship Bridge. The women in the Utatlan Trust Bank enjoy the monthly educational lessons, which are an integral part of the Friendship Bridge model, where the women in the Trust Bank discuss topics related to business administration, budget, promotion, and different ways of do business (wholesale, retail, catalog, personal sales, etc.).\r\n\r\nAngelica personally wants to thank Kiva investors for offering her access to financial capital, for their generosity, which has enabled her and her teammates to continue to grow their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3400,"image":{"id":1399664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Cruz del Quiche, El Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-08-04T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-03T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":3400,"lender_count":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Angelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dina Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Glenda Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelia Anneliesse Kemberly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aura Mariset ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Francis Nohemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fermina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricruz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":26500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3316},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3316},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3316},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3316},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3316},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3316},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3316},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3288}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":421.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":850.9,"local_amount":6632,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6657,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089113},{"amount":425.45,"local_amount":3316,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3328.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855082},{"amount":401.33,"local_amount":3128,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3139.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503418},{"amount":401.33,"local_amount":3128,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3139.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728402},{"amount":449.06,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3513.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449634425},{"amount":377.21,"local_amount":2940,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2951.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459100920},{"amount":494.72,"local_amount":3856,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3870.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467915915}],"funded_date":"2013-09-02T15:45:50Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T12:24:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":589482,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel is 43 years old.

textiles, and such is the case for the women from Santo Domingo Xenacoj.  Seven months ago the Las Rosas de Xenacoj (Xenacoj Roses) Trust Bank was formed. This new Trust Bank consists of eight women, who are on average 33 years old. Their businesses focus on the production of typical clothing and housewares like blouses, fajas (sashes), and tablecloths.  After seven months, all of the members of the Las Rosas de Xenacoj Trust Bank have successfully repaid their first loans and have now applied for a second loan cycle.  In addition, two new members have been voted into the Trust Bank.\r\n\r\nDolores, a new member of the Las Rosas de Xenacoj Trust Bank, is 28 years old and married to a tailor.  They are a new family as they just welcomed their first daughter into the world last year.  Dolores makes fajas (sashes) in various colors and designs. She is known in the community for having beautiful designs and colors that all of her clients thoroughly enjoy. At this point, her business is doing quite well, so she approached Friendship Bridge to request her first loan of approximately US $256. She will use these funds to buy a variety of colors of thread that she will use in order to keep up with the current demand for her garments. \r\n\r\nDolores is very excited about the loan, as she has clients who regularly purchase from her.   This means steady income for her and her family. As a young family, Dolores and her husband know that husbands and wives must work to support each other in order to provide the best life for their children.  Dolores has a dream to own a storefront where she can showcase her products and gain more clients without neglecting her regular customers who continue to support her and purchase her products.  Dolores has confidence and a business plan to do this and part of the plan relies on capital from Friendship Bridge. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the women in the Las Rosas de Xenacoj Trust Bank are grateful for the support of Friendship Bridge and KIVA investors.

one of the many villages of the department of Quetzaltenango, in western Guatemala. Eight women make up this Trust Bank and most of the group has traditional large families. The members of the Source of Blessing Trust Bank have joined Friendship Bridge, a microfinance and education organization in Guatemala in order to have access to working capital to support and expand their businesses.\r\n\r\nThe loans granted by Friendship Bridge benefit small micro-entrepreneurs. Teresa is one such entrepreneur, and is the secretary of The Fuente de Bendici\u00f3n Trust Bank. Teresa is a 36-year old woman who joined Friendship Bridge more than a year ago and is embarking on her third loan cycle. Currently Teresa\u2019s business is the production and sale of homemade tortillas, which she sells door-to-door. This model has allowed her to build up her client base over time. Teresa is requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to buy an industrial stove, gas, and corn, so she can produce more tortillas is less time. Teresa\u2019s business is generating income that supports all ten family members. Her dream is to expand her current business, and to possibly diversify her product offerings in the in the future to generate additional customers. \r\n\r\nIn addition to having access to capital, she also benefits from the monthly trainings she receives from her Friendship Bridge loan officer. In these monthly meetings the women receive educational programming and are encouraged to participate and have a voice on topics such as marketing, savings, sales, and reproductive health, among others.\r\n\r\nThe Fuente de Bendici\u00f3n Trust Bank is excited that people across the world want to invest in their development, as well the betterment of their families and communities. They want to ensure Kiva investors that they are very thankful and are committed to repaying the capital that they are receiving.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1399810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Currently the Trust Bank is composed of 12 women, who on average are 32 years old and have about three years of formal education. These women are very responsible, hard-working people who want to improve their lives and the lives of their children. Due to economic constraints, these women were unable to attend school, and had to work from a young age. They struggle daily to raise their young children and provide them with a better future.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a 29-year old member of Las Cruces Trust Bank who is married and has five children. Like many families in Chuanoj, Carmen and her husband are weavers. They use foot looms in order to make cortes (or traditional Guatemalan skirts), which they sell in markets nearby. \r\n\r\nBusiness is doing well and demands are high for their cortes so Carmen and her husband recently decided to hire two full-time employees. She also needs more capital to buy thread in bulk, so she is requesting a loan from Friendship Brige. This way she can keep the price low, increase production and maximize their revenues. She is currently able to fill and deliver orders within an eight-day period and is working hard to shorten the delivery time. \r\nBeyond receiving the loans, the Las Cruces Trust Bank has also created a circle of trust between its members. The women gather once a month and receive training giving by their Friendship Bridge loan officer. Through these facilitated activities, the women learn about and discuss business issues including budget management, identifying the different ways of do business (personal sales, telephone sales, wholesale sales, retail sales), and costs.  The educational sessions also cover personal issues like health, hygiene, women's rights, and self-esteem. \"Learning about these issues is a good benefit to our businesses,\" explains Carmen.  \"And it helps us with personal enrichment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Las Cruces Trust Bank acknowledges the importance of Kiva investors supporting them. They understand that in a developing country, such as Guatemala, they can create a decent working environment with your help.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5250,"image":{"id":1399821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To

When asked why she wanted to become a beekeeper, Leonida replied \u201cI love that bees make honey because it is medicinal.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is Leonida\u2019s first loan with Honey Care, and she plans to use the income generated by her beehives to start a small business, probably a shop. Leonida says her hope for the future is \"to own a shop to help me depend on myself not my children.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7,"image":{"id":1397872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives for honey production.

She has secondary education. Since 2003, Gulzadakhan has been engaged in farming - raising livestock and growing crops, having started her business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulzadakhan's hard work, and to her husband's assistance, the business is currently doing very well. She keeps 2 dairy cows and 15 sheep, while also cultivating a plot of land where she grows potatoes and corn. Her profits have allowed Gulzadakhan to increase the size of her herd and to improve her family's well-being.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Gulzadakhan has turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional livestock. She plans to invest her profits from the loan into further expansion of her herd, while also boosting her family's financial

In 1996, while looking for a source of income for her family, Sveta started raising livestock and growing crops. She launched her business with 15,000 som (KGS). Through back-breaking labour and constant effort, Sveta has achieved certain success in her business and began earning 13,000 som (KGS) per month. Presently, she keeps 3 dairy cows and 1 horse, and also has 6.84 hectares of land for cultivation of grains. Sveta's husband assists her in the business.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Sveta has turned to Bai-Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock for fattening and resale.

He has been repairing and selling mobile phones for living since 2009. His wife recently began running small pawnshop. His mother has retired from work and gets a state pension. His mother looks after his two children at home. He wants to make an extension to his house as his children are getting bigger and bigger each passing day. He wants to create separate rooms for his children to study and sleep. So he is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, metal, cement, and bricks. Using those materials, he will make the necessary extension to his house. Aside from providing additional space for the family, the extension also has environmental benefits as it will distribute heat loss and maintain heat longer.

Deliles engages in selling meals at night, and for this reason she has set a table outside her house where she very kindly serves all her customers. \n\nShe has been engaged in this activity for more than 6 years, starting with her own working capital. Her business is very profitable, given the demand for her products and that there are no other food vendors in the area. She says she has opted for this activity because she likes cooking.

His wife has been selling clothes and toys for children for five years. His parents have retired and receive state pensions. His mother and father, though retired, are still contributing to the family income by working as a cook and a carpenter, respectively. He used his previous loan on insulating the walls and roof, but the house still loses heat through its roof. He is applying for a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to buy and spray foam into the curb roof (a gambrel roof or mansard roof). As a result, the house will stop losing heat through the roof, and the family will burn less coal for heating, thus releasing fewer pollutants into the air and contributing to the efforts to combat air pollution.

Mercedes is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person who has a great desire to improve. Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources and the necessity that she work, she wasn't able to study the degree in Agriculture that she wanted to take. In her free time, she likes to distract herself by watching TV, and at times she cooks a delicious chicken soup to share with her family.\n\nOn her own initiative, and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Mercedes works as a field labourer at an agricultural estate in her city. She works washing, cutting and peeling vegetables, among other tasks. Mercedes works every day starting early in the morning, and she can work for about eight hours.\n\nMercedes is very appreciative of Kiva lenders, since she will be able to buy a stove thanks to the help being offered.

With a new stove, Mercedes and her family will be able to prepare their food adequately, and she will continue to work and push herself to achieve her great dream of having her own home.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1397907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a stove.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-08-05T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-04T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":207.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":215.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":233.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":244.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":251.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":261.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":276.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":282.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":294.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":304.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":149.58,"local_amount":407.95,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":415.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779390},{"amount":79.18,"local_amount":215.93,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":220.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054588},{"amount":83.36,"local_amount":227.36,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":231.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819485},{"amount":85.5,"local_amount":233.17,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":237.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472427},{"amount":89.71,"local_amount":244.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":249.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694904},{"amount":92.31,"local_amount":251.75,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":256.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450390940},{"amount":197.15,"local_amount":537.68,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":548.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880359},{"amount":103.57,"local_amount":282.45,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":288.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479103921},{"amount":107.87,"local_amount":294.2,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490799011},{"amount":111.77,"local_amount":304.83,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":310.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517510997}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T01:34:33Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T09:46:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aesclinn Donohue","image":1310197}},{"id":589919,"name":"Jo-Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jo-ann lives in Inasagan, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur.

She is very well-known in the area where she lives.  When she was 20 she began studying cosmetology until she graduated from the academy.  Then she started to work in a beauty salon, where she started as a helper.  She started by getting experience in cuts, styling, and doing the new hairstyles.  This made her excel and stand out with the customers.\r\n\r\nThen, as the years passed, she decided to have her own business.  She requested a loan to firm up this project.  She later got married and had two children.  She is now divorced, and the children have grown.  Her son is 12, and her daughter is 6.  They both go to school.  She has been able to raise them on her own with the beauty salon business.  She is a very responsible mother.\r\n\r\nShe will buy the products from a woman who sells cosmetology products like shampoo, rinses, hair dyes, and hair treatments.  Actually, she buys products from various companies.  However, when she runs out she buys them at a friend\u2019s beauty salon.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy more products that she needs for her business.  This is because her daughter got sick, which cost her.  She was left with little money.  She did not have enough products, so she decided to request a loan to buy them and to have her products stocked for sale.\r\n\r\nThe need that will be satisfied is being able to buy products in order to have more income.  Also, when a customer requests a product, she will be able to sell it to the customer.  She will improve her quality of life with the daily income from her business.  This way she will be able to give her children an education and clothing.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to continue working with the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo as time passes in order to complete this loan and to be able to request another one according to her needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1403787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy more products that she needs for the business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-05T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-04T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":40.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":44.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":56.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090852}],"funded_date":"2013-09-04T00:21:36Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":591722,"name":"Sarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sarita tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada con Juli\u00e1n con quien tiene dos hijos de 12 y 8 a\u00f1os de edad respectivamente con quienes vive en su casa propia.

Concepcion spends most of her time doing embroidery and house work.  Since there are no more children at home to attend to, she goes out and assists in harvesting ripe cacao pods at the farm.\n\nMarcus got inspired to plant cacao with the assistance given by a local association.

The most notable festival honors St. Peter, the patron saint of Rioyos. \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel, 66, belongs to the group and has been married to Crecencia for many years.

For 18 years, \u00c1ngel has owned a small grocery shop, a business he started because his father also owned a store. \u00c1ngel says that the income his father earned inspired him to open his own grocery store. As \u00c1ngel is older, he would have a hard time finding a job, but the store allows him to pay expenses. \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel has applied for a loan to buy items like bread, eggs, milk, sugar, salt, and detergent. \u00c1ngel calls his store \u201cLa Mesa del Rinc\u00f3n\u201d (Corner Table) because there has always been a wooden table in the same spot in the corner of his store. The only business problem \u00c1ngel faces is competition. However, he has many friends who are regular customers, so he doesn't worry much about competition. He says, \"My only goal is seeing the store prosper, as I would not want to close it.\"\r\n\r\nThe other members are also grateful for the loan, which will help them invest in their businesses and slowly see them prosper.

She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales, every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Lorna is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more corn for her business.\r\n\r\nLorna dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her children will finish their studies. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1400712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She plans to continue working with the same motivation as always.  This is because her objective is to increase the size of her parcels even more by purchasing other land that her neighbors plan to sell in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva.  She is grateful for the financial support she is receiving in order to get ahead.  She pledges to make her payments punctually.  She will use the 1,000 soles to buy organic fertilizer and coffee seeds.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1403803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer and coffee seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-05T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-04T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":109.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":121.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":119.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":129.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":133.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":135.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":141.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.97,"local_amount":109.25,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":114.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865122},{"amount":41.31,"local_amount":110.16,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":115.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353488},{"amount":45.47,"local_amount":121.26,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":127.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905252},{"amount":44.9,"local_amount":119.72,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":125.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091246},{"amount":48.44,"local_amount":129.19,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":135.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777842},{"amount":50.04,"local_amount":133.44,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":140.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598219},{"amount":50.82,"local_amount":135.51,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-03T09:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":142.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147406},{"amount":53.05,"local_amount":141.47,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-09T09:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":148.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240578}],"funded_date":"2013-08-05T22:45:51Z","paid_date":"2014-09-09T09:57:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":589983,"name":"Rogelio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rogelio is 61 years old, married with five children and operates a transportation services business.

His loan request was rejected each time because his business isn't registered as a formal business.
