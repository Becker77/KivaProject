Because of his difficult financial situation due to lack of jobs, he decided to take personalized courses in oriental medicine. As a result he was able to start offering therapeutic services in oriental medicine and selling health and nutritional products from his office. As well Salvador travels to people's houses. He has managed to earn enough money in this way to support his household.\r\n\r\nSalvador is an entrepreneurial, level-headed man who wants to make progress in life so he is seeking a loan to buy Amway health and nutrition products (vitamins, dietary supplements, malt drinks and shakes). He wishes to offer his customers products that will improve their physical and mental health.

of the lake Miguel Aleman and the principal economic activity here is fishing. The community is visited by people from the surrounding towns who come here to spend time with their families. They take advantage of the beaches and  enjoy the delicious mojarra fish that is found here. \r\n\r\nIn this community there is a group called Naranjo, made up of 7 people, each of whom has their own business that they use to try to give their families a better life; Ofelia sells clothes, Javier sells paper, Evelin sells soft drinks, Jose Luis sells ice cream and slushies, Gilberta sells clothes, Ismael sells groceries and Marco sells water and sorbets. \r\n\r\nDon Javier has been running his business for 9 years and he has his own paper supply store in the center of this community. He says that when he started his business, it was because there was nowhere to buy paper products in town and the students there had a hard time getting a hold of school materials.

She is the featured borrower member for Muhit A Shg Group. The group comprises twelve tribal women members who are financially independent and generate income for their respective families. All the group members reside in a village on the northern part of Manipur state, which is also one of the northeastern states in India. \r\n\r\nKipjang\u2019s husband is a teacher in a private school, and his earning is insufficient to manage the family\u2019s expenses. The income that her husband generates is mainly used for their kids\u2019 education. The rest of the expenses are borne by Kipjang, who raises cattle and weaves to supplement the family income.\r\n\r\nKipjang is raising cattle at her home, and she has one female cow with a calf at present. The cow and the calf are usually reared at the nearby fields for fresh grass to eat. The milk produced is sold every day to the neighbours, as the milk quantity is enough to sell. The income generated is usually used for daily expenses, which is why there are times when they don\u2019t have enough cash to purchase feed for the cattle. \r\n\r\nBesides raising cattle, Kipjang also weaves to make more income for the family. She usually purchases yarn and thread from the city market and weaves with them. Her woven finished products are women\u2019s wrap-around skirts, men\u2019s traditional shawls, and women's traditional shawls. The demands for woven products are high, as they are the main attire for the women in their tradition. Kipjang could not meet the demands of her customers. The unavailability of looms paralyzes her to produce more woven products, as she weaves with the traditional back-strap. She hardly manages three or four at the maximum in a month. \r\n\r\nShe wants a loan from Kiva and WSDS to purchase nutritional feed for the cattle and more yarn for weaving purposes. The nutritional feed is necessary, as the cow is also used in place of a machine for ploughing purposes, and the milk production needs to be adequate in quantity. She also wanted to purchase various yarn for weaving purposes to weave better and expensive woven products. That way, she will generate a better means of income and repay the loan amount in time. \r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful deeds and says she is delighted to work with them.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1400617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase various yarn and thread for weaving, and also to purchase a nutritional diet for her cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-05T19:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-04T19:50:01Z","loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kipjang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneikip","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamnuntheng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemjavah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veikhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Momring","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneihat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoirengkip","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T22:07:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":589998,"name":"Uk","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Uk is 63 years old and a widow.

She constructed a building next to her home for the store and bought a refrigerator, shelving, tables and part of her inventory.  She doesn't have the funds to buy the rest of the products she intends to sell so she's taking out a loan.  With the loan, she'll make the rest of the necessary purchases and open the store.  Her son and daughter-in-law will help her run the business.  The loan will allow Saibibi to start her family business and improve her quality of life.

To improve his family's finances, he wants to start a business raising sheep and combine it with his crop-raising work. Altiboy is planning on buying and fattening sheep for later resale. He has a shed in his yard for keeping the livestock and 300 bales of hay. He is requesting a loan in the amount of 1500 US dollars to buy 12 head of sheep. Altiboy figures that keeping sheep won't be much trouble for him; they  are grazing animals, and don't require special feed. They are easy to breed, handle the cold weather well, and are very hardy. Altiboy intends to utilize the profits from the business to repair his house and improve his family's standard of

school-aged and younger (three sons and three daughters).  She has a high school diploma.    After the collapse of collective farms in 1994, she received a plot of land, 2.07 hectares, on which she began farming.  She started her business with 10,000 KGS and now her monthly profit is 10,000 KGS.  She has developed her agricultural efforts and grows mostly beans.  She also works with livestock.  She has one dairy cow.  Her spouse helps her with the farm and also offers carpentry services.  With the goal of further business development, Anarkul has turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 20,000 KGS to buy ammonium nitrate to fertilize her land.  She plans to use the income from the loan to increase her herd and to provide her children with a worthy education.

This is the first time that Angel has joined the Dalias group. He says that a friend of his mum saw that he was a reliable worker and knew that he wanted to invest in his business maintaining motorbikes, so she invited him to join. He says he learnt how to service and maintain motorbikes because a friend who had a workshop taught him how to do everything from when he was little. Apart from that, Angel has always liked motorbikes, so eight years ago he decided to start his own workshop since he got married and needed to support his family. Angel lives with his mum, who gave him a piece of land where he could set up his business. He says it is going well as he is putting a lot of effort into carrying out his repairs so that his customers will come back and recommend him. \r\n\r\nHe says that he is applying for a loan now to buy spare parts and tools that he needs for his motorcycles. He says that if he receives this loan his workshop will improve since a friend lends him tools but he wants to buy his own. He is grateful to those who have put their trust in him to give him this loan and he promises to make the most of it.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Minerva, Rosalba, Leopoldo, Norma, Martina and Ana Laura. They used their loans for different businesses including a grocery store (in which the photo is taken), the purchase of second hand clothes to resell, mattresses, sheets, covers, quilts from a catalogue and material to make handcrafted garments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6875,"image":{"id":1401857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy parts and tools to service the motorbikes he repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":6875,"lender_count":230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minerva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leopoldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Laura","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":87000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":6875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":7874.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8047.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8223.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8404.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8589.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8777.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8970.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9167.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9369.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":9575.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":635.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":649.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":664.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":678.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":693.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":724.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":740.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":756.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1955.43,"local_amount":24745.13,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T09:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":24764.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944874},{"amount":1345.39,"local_amount":17025.25,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":17038.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227949},{"amount":1405.16,"local_amount":17781.63,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":17795.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991794},{"amount":1467.59,"local_amount":18571.63,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":18585.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644443},{"amount":701.43,"local_amount":8876.36,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8883.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877905}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T19:18:55Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:27:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":590076,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita is 60 years old and lives in Dao-an, San Miguel, ZDS.

She is the mother of one son who will soon begin school. She says that she is excited for her son to go to preschool. Although the costs are high between the materials that the school requests she purchase and the uniform required, she says that it is all worth it for her son to study so that when he is older he will have a good job because the work in the fields is very difficult. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to a group when requests loans to improve their businesses in order to be able to get income and improve their living conditions. Her group is called Chalmita because she and her group members are followers of the holy saint of Chalma. She has been making a living over sheep for two years and says that she began this business to support her husband with the household expenses and also so that she can have her own income. She says that her sales are best during the months of May, June and December. During May and June it is because the schools are closing so the parents are making food and having parties to celebrate their children leaving school, and in December it is because of Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year's celebrations. \r\n\r\nShe comments that her sales are going well and she is now requesting a loan to buy food for her the seven sheep that remain from her recent sales. She also wants to buy a ewe to continue raising more lambs. She also raises and sells turkeys which are easier to care for than sheep. She buys the sheep from others in her community and she sells them from her home. Her husband also sometimes brings the sheep and turkey to sell in a community called Zitacuaro where an open air market is held on Thursdays when they need money more urgently. \r\n\r\nShe is thankful to Visi\u00f3n Fund for the loan that is being given to her so that she can improve her business. The rest of the members of the group include Cecilia, Esperanza, and Mar\u00eda Marcelina.

She is a native of an indigenous community called Macho de Agua, which adjoins the State of M\u00e9xico.  An office for Visi\u00f3n Mundial there helps low-income children to have a better quality of life.  Lidia has two children who are sponsored by Visi\u00f3n Mundial, and she says that thanks to this organization her children live in better conditions.  They are watchful of their nutrition, health and education so they can be productive members of their community and their country.  In addition, Lidia gets training on how to have a stable business.  She decided eight years ago to have a business raising and selling pigs.  Her husband made her a number of pens so she could keep her pigs in good conditions.  She says that she decided to sell pigs because in her community nobody was doing so.  And so she got excited about it.  In addition, the pigs are easy to feed.  She says that her husband helps her to sell them, as he takes them in a pick-up truck to a town where there are street markets every Thursday.  He sells them there.  She says that there are two months a year that she sells a bit more, which are June- because of the school closings- and December- because of the December Christmas celebrations and the New Year.  She also says that in her town, people come to her house to buy pigs.  She has three big pigs which are the ones that give offspring, so she keeps the big ones.  She also has a stud, which she doesn't sell.  Right now Lidia is asking for a loan to purchase animal feed and inoculations for the animals to keep them in the best possible condition. \r\nLidia belongs to a communal bank called \"Uni\u00f3n y Amistad\" (Union and Friendship) which has been working together for various cycles.  She says that they are doing well in their businesses.  The other members are Ofelia, Marisol, Fabi\u00e1n and Gilberta.  They will invest in their businesses, which are an avocado garden, a school cooperative, medications for a pharmacy and clothing for babies and women. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4350,"image":{"id":1402418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase animal feed and inoculations for pigs.

She started this business by selling on a table in a market and later received money from her husband to increase her inventory, and learned this way of selling from her friends.

Most interestingly, she learned the different kinds of local languages.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 100,000 LRD loan to purchase more cement for her business. Her plan is to educate her children.

He says he started bark clothmaking to supplement earnings from his plantation, which usually gives earnings only after 2 weeks.\r\nHe says he managed to acquire the motorcycle that has helped him with transportation, which has boosted his income. He was able to buy a piece of land that has allowed him plant more bananas for more output.Of recent he has managed to assemble some bricks which he hopes to use to put up a semi permanent house to improve his house hold living. He hopes to use the facility extended to him to mulch his plantation especially as it\u2019s been a dry spell and also buy more back cloth for trade. He confesses a major challenge is scarcity of the bark cloth and also pests like termites that eat up the tree trunks, hence having poor quality pieces of bark

grew up in Mexico and dreamt of owning a business and home. She immigrated to San Diego 16 years ago, and before starting Paradiso Fruit, she worked for a local Panaderia, or Mexican bakery. The popular bakery was known both for its empanadas and the variety of healthier options, including gluten-free goods. \r\n\r\nThis mother of six children is no stranger to hard work.  Leticia helped scrub and clean at the popular bakery. While taking out the trash one day, she walked by another storefront and noticed that it was empty. \u201cThe shop looked trashed, the walls were collapsing,\u201d Leticia shared. As she looked at the empty storefront, she felt inspired to create healthy food alternatives for her family and community.  Back at home, her family enjoyed the baked treats that their mother helped create, but Leticia noticed a growing problem. \u201cI was watching my kids get fatter and fatter,\u201d she exclaimed. \r\n\r\nSetting up the new store was no small feat and was a community effort from the beginning. Leticia\u2019s church jumped in to help. A church member created the beautiful murals that customers can now enjoy in the store. Another scraped and painted the store. Her son and another friend dragged junk from the store and reconstructed it.\r\n\r\nLeticia\u2019s Kiva loan will help her purchase her initial inventory of healthy food. Customers can enjoy fruit salads, sandwiches and more nutritious meal options. Business is already growing.  She shares, \u201cBefore this it was just Taqueria after Taqueria! People come in and thank me for the healthy options.\u201d \r\n\r\n The current menu has been a success and Leticia will stick with what she knows. \u201cPeople are looking for ways to be healthier,\u201d she says. She plans to grow the new business, then open new stores and create more jobs for the community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1400984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is requesting a loan of PHP 50,000 to buy canned goods and stocks of beverages to sell in her store. She will also use the loan for the maintenance of her coconut and rice grinder machine.

However due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Bushra as a member of a two-person group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business. Bushra is very thankful to Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1391330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded

He lives with his wife and daughter. \r\n\r\nHe has owned \u201cDavie Feed and Ranch Supplies LLC\u201d for nearly two years now. His business is a retail store that offers high-quality hay, farm tools, lawn supplies, and gifts. He also sells animal feed and supplies. Part of the reason Kenny loves owning a small business is the one-on-one contact he gets with customers. \u201cI love working with people and love to see my client happy with what I offer\u201d, says Kenny. \r\n\r\nRecently, he has increased his business hours by opening on Sundays while his competitors are closed.

She lives with her husband Julio, with whom she has four children. They live in the house they bought thirteen years ago. From the early hours of the day she spends time tending to her plots of land. She says that thanks to her good income she has been able to buy more plots of land, where she sows large amounts of potatoes and corn. Her village is at the edge of the river and this helps her to improve her sown fields and to have high-quality harvests. Transportation is also easy for her because they are near the central motorway. Now her project is to get into raising animals. She says that she already has some cows and pigs, which she sells when she encounters any economic difficulties. Now she wants to improve her crops in order to obtain greater revenue and be able to invest more in farming. This is her first loan with Kiva, and she feels grateful for the economic support she is receiving to get ahead in life. She promises to make her repayments on time.

In the community there are brigades of men who take care of the forests in order to maintain the village.  During summer vacation the children go off to the forests to collect \"ocoshal\" to sell to the community artisans.  In this way they help their parents cover household expenses and sometimes buy themselves sweets and refreshments.\r\n\r\nIrma has three children who are in elementary school.  She has an avocado field that she has been cultivating for two years.  The field does not produce avocados yet because the plants are small but in a year they should be ready.  She also makes ocoshal crafts that she sells to buyers who visit the community.  She would like to sell them in other cities to earn a little more and to make her beautiful pine palm crafts well known.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting loan through VisionFund to buy organic fertilizer called \"esti\u00e9rcol de borrego\"  (sheep manure) and insecticides to improve her cropland.  She will also buy material for her crafts such as thread in different colors, needles, chlorine, soap and a large tub to wash the ocoshal.  She says:  \"I am grateful to the lending institution for having confidence in me and for giving me loans to improve my businesses so I can give my children a better life.\"  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the Chibaty Group are Mar\u00eda Leucadia, Amelia and Mar\u00eda Crisanta.  They will use their loans to buy supplies to improve their avocado fields and to buy material to make ocoshal crafts."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":1401846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy organic fertilizer called \"lama de borrego\", hydrated lime, thread, needles, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T10:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T10:00:01Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Leucadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Crisanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3251.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3409.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3613.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3751.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3960.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4126.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4327.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4559.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":296.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":313.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":326.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":257.15,"local_amount":3253.76,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T09:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3256.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944878},{"amount":269.66,"local_amount":3412.07,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3415.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227953},{"amount":285.8,"local_amount":3616.27,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3619.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991798},{"amount":296.69,"local_amount":3754.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3757.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644446},{"amount":313.23,"local_amount":3963.28,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3966.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877908},{"amount":326.36,"local_amount":4129.48,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4133.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766956},{"amount":342.24,"local_amount":4330.4,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4334.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247773},{"amount":358.87,"local_amount":4540.72,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4544.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072848}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T05:17:42Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":590272,"name":"Jenelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenelyn is 24 years old and single.

","en":"Marta, 48, is a single mother of two children, ages 9 and 12.  Out of necessity and due to the difficult economic situation she has been in because of a lack of employment opportunities, she decided to go into business for herself to support her family.  She set up a small street vending business with a small hand-pulled artisan cart she uses to sell cakes, bagged water, lemonade, pastries, etc.   She started working all by herself and has been able to educate her small children and put food on the table.\r\n\r\nMarta is a hard-working, dedicated woman who goes out every afternoon after she does the housework.  She must distribute her time in such a way as to be able to attend to her children.  She constantly struggles against challenges and external obstacles that get in her way.  Problems such as civil disorder and climate change make her work more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe borrower is requesting a loan to buy a variety of goods (cakes, cookies, pastries, lemonade and bagged water) and change her artisan cart for a larger one.  This will allow her to have a wider variety of products to offer customers so she can increase her income.  Martha is hoping to get a stall through the city hall so she can improve her work conditions and attract more customers.  This would allow her to improve her family's lifestyle and give her children a better education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1404690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy goods (cakes, cookies, pastries, lemonade and bagged water) and to acquire a larger cart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Rubiela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":52963},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":54416},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":55908},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":57441},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":59016},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60634},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":62296},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":64005},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":65760},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":67561}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.64,"local_amount":54718,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T09:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":56017.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822350},{"amount":28.63,"local_amount":52854,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":54109.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807333},{"amount":30.26,"local_amount":55856,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":57182.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095424},{"amount":236.47,"local_amount":436572,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":446941.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074487}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T19:17:18Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:52:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":590276,"name":"Felisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felisa is 54 years old, married and has four children.

Florinda sells bean seeds in Santiago's town market.  She has been doing this work for eight years, with people coming to look for Florinda as she sells in bulk and offers good prices.  Depending on the season, she also sells corn for chickens, oranges, and animal feed.  Florinda is grateful because she also has a tailoring workshop where, twice a week, she tends to her customers.

Due to a lack of opportunities for work and the difficult economic situation he found himself in, Ovidio decided to learn gardening and has been working independently as a gardener, pruning and tidying up the gardens of houses and farms around where he lives. His working day is 6am to 4pm and he works alone. Through this activity he has been able to earn enough money to support his household. Ovidio is a hardworking man who strives every day to help his son get ahead in life.

Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1337457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Tingkhohoi. She is pictured with her hand raised and is the featured borrower member for \u201cJemhoi-Group\u201d. She has one son only and lives with her husband in a village which is about 45 kms away from the city capital of Imphal. Imphal is one of the capital states of the North-Eastern states of India. She has switched her business from growing and selling vegetables to running a variety shop in the village. Her husband also earns his living as a farmer. He ploughs others' fields and earns his daily wages. The family financial resources are entirely borne by Tingkhohoi and her husband. \r\n\r\nTingkhohoi runs a general store in the village. She sells only essential goods for the villagers which include detergent soaps, detergent powder, sachets of shampoo, different cereals, edible oils, loose as well as in pouches, candies, sweets, tea-leaves, sugar, potatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, etc. She usually gets her stocks from the city market and also from army canteen suppliers. She usually gets cosmetic items like hair-oil, face-cream, soap\/powdered soap from army canteen suppliers. The rates are subsidized as the supply is purchased from the army canteen at a cheaper rate as compared to the market rate. She sells only the basic needs or required items for the villagers as villagers are her sole customers.  \r\n\r\nTingkhohoi wants a loan to refill her general store with more cereals, imported rice, edible oils, etc. She aspires to supply the villagers on a credit basis in the future. She shared that, instant cash payment for goods by the buyers in the village is not easy. The villagers are managing their expenses with the meager income that they generate. If she can abundantly stock her store and be a supplier for the villagers, then the unnecessary spending on fares for transportation to purchase small items like soap or edible oil could be prevented and she will be able to make good sales, which will literally generate good income and will facilitate the villagers, too. \r\n\r\nShe thanked KIva and WSDS for the joint movement to facilitate women entrepreneurs. She and the other member wish them good-will and progress in their future works. She says, \u201cThank you, Kiva!\u201d \r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving, poultry, and piggery.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1399424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase goods to refill the general store with cereals, imported rice, edible oils and kids'  delicacies to earn more profits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T14:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T14:20:07Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nemlam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingkhohat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenglam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":145000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T17:28:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":592191,"name":"Lesly Xiomara","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lesly es una mujer que la mayor parte de su vida se crio solo con su madre ya que su papa muri\u00f3 cuando ella era una ni\u00f1a y su madre con todo el sacrificio la saco adelante y logro que cursara la secundaria completa.

His wife is a  homemaker but in her spare time she helps her husband feed the animals.  At present they have ten head of cattle, eight of which are milk cows that provide five or six liters of milk per day.  Bohir's wife makes dairy products and sells them to friends and neighbors.  They work night and day, trying to ensure that their children have everything they need.  They have have a very good income from their business.  \r\n\r\nBohir also farms, but his main business is fattening up the cattle.  Right now he is planning to add to his herd because cattle are less expensive.  He wants to fatten them up before wintertime and then sell them close to winter for a higher price, so he is turning to MDO Arvand for a loan. He really hopes they will help and sustain him financially."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1397578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

Its members are mainly poultry farmers with only a few cows because their land area is small. They live in a rural area where there is no electricity and there is scarcity of fuel. Without a formal source of livelihood, the group members rely on poultry farming for a large percentage of their income. Some of the members rear layers while others specialize in broilers. On average,a tray of eggs sells for about $2.50, and a single member can produce up to four trays a day. A broiler chicken sells for approximately $3.80, with a single member rearing at least 100 chickens in a month. Money from these sales goes to cater for the chicken feed, payment of school fees as well as taking care of the other family needs.\n\nSolar lamps save on members' fuel costs, such as kerosene, which amounts to  approximately $16 a month. Improved stoves decreases firewood and charcoal usage, which costs a family about $9 a month. Members also find it necessary to use the efficient cook stoves in warming the poultry houses to keep their chicken warm and healthy. \n\nAfter receiving training on consumer education and financial management by Visionary Empowerment Programme, the members showed interest in solar lamps and improved cook stoves. Due to family responsibilities and economic constrains, however, they were unable to save upfront for the products and they opted instead to take loans. \n\nMary, the group's chair lady, has been using kerosene to light her house and poultry house, and she also uses charcoal to warm the poultry house. With the solar lamps, she no longer has to buy kerosene and charcoal and thus saves money. If she ploughs the amount she saves back to her poultry business, it will lead to growth and business expansion.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1400757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

Lahore, Pakistan.  She belongs to a happy family because her husband earns sufficient income to meet daily household expenses.\r\n\r\nHer husband has been running a motor mechanic shop since 1993 in a nearby town. He is very professional and experienced in his work; most of the clients become his close friends and like him to repair their bikes. Her husband is very hard working and honest. He demands very low services charges for his services, so that is why people like him to repair their bikes. Due to his honesty and low rate, he has created a good reputation and goodwill in his community. \r\n\r\nHis shop is very tiny and has very low capacity to stand motorbikes for repairing.  Now he wants to expand his shop and merge with the neighborhood shop, but he does not have capital to invest for the expansion.\r\n\r\nIrshad requested a loan of 45,000 PKR from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband would be able to expand his shop. Irshad hopes that through the shop expansion more customers will be attracted toward his shop, which will cause an increase in income and savings.\r\n\r\nIrhsad has praise for the lenders and is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC

Her monthly income from the livestock is 3500KGS.   Thanks to her persistent work, nowadays she has on the farm: five milk cows, twenty-five sheep, two mares, and two stallions.  She also started out with 3 1\/2  hectares of land where every year she plants beans and perennial grasses.  In order to develop her business more, Roza has turned to \"Bai Tulum\" communal bank for a loan of 35,000KGS so she can buy a milk cow.

The land that they work is their own, thanks to a family inheritance, and the other part through the effort that they have made to have land and work.

El terreno que ella en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo y sus hijos trabaja es propio y lo adquiri\u00f3 gracias a la compra que hicieron a uno de sus clientes el cual les facilito a ellos obtener un terreno para trabajar lo propio y est\u00e1 ubicado en el mismo lugar donde est\u00e1 construida su casa de habitaci\u00f3n.\n\nElla actualmente necesita un apoyo econ\u00f3mico para la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas para proteger sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 con los cuales al final de la cosecha ella planea vender el grano y obtener ingresos para re invertir en sus cultivos.    \n\nLos planes y sue\u00f1os a futuro son los de comprar m\u00e1s tierra para poder seguir cultivando caf\u00e9 y ofrecer una mejor variedad como el caturra, lempira, etc. que son productos competitivos en el mercado y m\u00e1s atractivos para sus clientes.\n","en":"Maria, 43, is a homemaker and farmer.  She's the mother of nine children who help each other get ahead, as in any big family.  The family business is growing and selling coffee.  She and her live-in companion have done this work for more than 30 years.\r\n\r\nThrough her own interest she decided to learn to farm with her parents, who have farmed their entire lives.  Her customers are neighbors and intermediaries who come to or live in the area where she lives.  She also sells in the local market and in nearby places.\r\n\r\nThe land that she and her husband and their children farm is her own.  She acquired it thanks to one of her customers, who facilitated the sale.  It's located in the same place where their house is built.\r\n\r\nCurrently she needs some economic support to buy inputs to protect her coffee crop, which she'll sell.  At the end of the harvest she plans to sell the beans and earn income to re-invest in her crops.\r\n\r\nHer plans and dreams for the future are to buy more land to be able to continue growing coffee and offer a better variety, such as caturra and lempira beans, which are competitive products in the market and more attractive for her customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1405193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy agricultural inputs ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Taulabe, Siguatepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cruz  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4.26,"local_amount":85.25,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:51:09Z","rounded_local_amount":86.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070291},{"amount":5.81,"local_amount":116.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":118.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833726},{"amount":3.52,"local_amount":70.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":71.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042189},{"amount":1.67,"local_amount":33.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":33.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710532},{"amount":4.98,"local_amount":99.67,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":101.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449616503},{"amount":827.4,"local_amount":16547.92,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":16874.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082612},{"amount":402.36,"local_amount":8047.08,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8205.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118176}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T19:42:47Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T10:42:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":592608,"name":"Nilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa Joven Nilda tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, es una persona muy luchadora y responsable vive junto a su familia en  una comunidad al sur de Honduras.

Her specialty was going to be pediatrics because she always liked children.  Over time, Cristina has wanted to study different professions such as psychology, teaching, law and even to be a flight attendant, but she never forgot about her dream of being a doctor.\r\n\r\nIn her senior year of high school she was unsure about what to do because she would soon be leaving a time of friendships, partying and playing pranks, which she enjoyed so much, and going into the real world where one must struggle to get better things.  After graduation, Cristina starting looking into what she wanted to study but had forgotten her dream because many people said the degree required a lot more than simply wanting to be something.\r\n\r\nWith those simple words, Cristina abandoned her dream and started looking at other careers.  One day while talking to her brother he asked what had happened to her dream, because he remembered that Cristina used to play doctor with her dolls.  She said she could not study medicine because she did not have enough money.\r\n\r\nCristina's brother told her not to abandon her dream and to study to be a nurse auxiliary which would be a good line of work to go into so she could get into medicine professionally.\r\n\r\nCristina thought about it and decided to study to be a nursing auxiliary and after one semester she is thrilled.  She knows that when she finds a job at a hospital she will be able to pay for a nursing degree and after that she can pay for a medical degree and go into pediatrics.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most is learning about giving out medication, drawing blood, curing wounds and knowing that she can become a great doctor.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Cristina, an adolescent who always wanted to become a doctor and little by little, with effort and dedication will realize her dream of becoming the best pediatrician in order to provide for her family and make them proud of her.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1385468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To continue her second semester of nursing in Campoalto","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T20:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T20:30:09Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina Yineth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":840000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":289124.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780594},{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":144562.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539971},{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":144562.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752498},{"amount":150,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":289124.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439696775}],"funded_date":"2013-08-06T22:49:30Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":591021,"name":"Brayan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Brayan, Para estudiar  y crecer   y mejorar su calidad de vida  busco la asesor\u00eda para poder cumplir su sue\u00f1o de estudiar.

","en":"Boobek is 42 years old, married and has three children.  His spouse is a homemaker and helps him with his work.  While searching for a source of income for his family in 2007, Boobek started farming and working with livestock.  He started his business with 10,000 KGS and today his monthly profits are 5,000 KGS.  In his care he has one dairy cow, one calf, and ten sheep.  He also has a plot of land, 2.10 hectares, where he grows mostly beans, peppers and vegetables.  Boobek also uses his own vehicle to offer taxi services which brings in a little income.

","en":"Aminjon is 18 years old.  He is unmarried and lives with his parents. Aminjon studied well in school and actively participated in all extra-curricular activities of the school. He has finished school this year and is entered university. He enrolled at the National University of Tajikistan. Aminjon hopes that he will be a successful student at the university as well.

After the death of her husband, who was the breadwinner of the family, Ratkhan became involved in animal husbandry in order to provide for her family. She started the business with 10,000 somons (KGS). Thanks to her tireless labor and hard work, Ratkhan achieved some success and has been receiving a monthly profit of 10,000 somons (KGS). Today, Ratkhan has 4 dairy cows and 30 sheep on her farm. Her youngest son helps her with the business. Her oldest son lives separately and helps out financially. In order to further grow her business, Ratkhan asked the Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 somons (KGS) for the purchase of one cow and some sheep. Ratkhan plans to invest the income from the loan in order to further increase in the number of livestock on her farm, and plans to build a new home in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1402099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cow and sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kolduk village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-07T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-06T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":78.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ratkhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":307.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":307.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":307.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":307.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":15028.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777135},{"amount":307.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":15028.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553010},{"amount":307.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":15028.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053231},{"amount":307.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":15028.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462730},{"amount":287.01,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15028.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.49,"payment_id":561577974},{"amount":454.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":25048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":58.34,"payment_id":610751026}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T16:13:47Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:11:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":590458,"name":"Duaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Duaa is 22 years old.

She is passing her life happily with her five children; one of her sons is married, but does not have a proper job to support a single family. Imtiaz wants to start a business for her elder son selling vegetables, but she has already spent all of her savings on her son's marriage ceremony. She has a greater need of money, so that she can manage the initial capital for the vegetable vending business, but none of her relatives financially support her.\r\n\r\nTherefore, she presented her humble request to Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, and after understanding the terms and conditions, she applied for a loan of Rs. 25,000. With this loan, she can easily start the small business for her son.\r\n\r\nImtiaz has grown old and worried about her sons because, until now, none of her sons much settled in their businesses. She hopes that her son will settle in this newly started business and will be able to support the family alone. \r\n\r\nImtiaz is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nThawra is a 24-year-old married woman from Rafah City. She is a mother to three young sons. Thawra's husband works as an employee in the public sector. His income is low and barely covers the monthly expenses for the family. Thawra and her husband would like to improve their home and their living conditions.

The family lives in poverty and gets small social assistance from the local government. \r\n\r\nSeveral times, Ketevan has requested loans from local financial institutions in order to start up her clothing trading business but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected because of lack of experience in the business which is usually demanded by local financial institutions. Her loan request has now been approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit with soft conditions to country's vulnerable poor who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \"high-risk borrowers\" because of low income. With the received credit, Ketevan plans to purchase clothing from wholesalers and then resell these items from her house. Her regular clients will be neighbors and villagers. After investing the funds in her business, Ketevan hopes to generate additional revenue and invest the profits to further develop her business.
