She became involved in animal husbandry in 2004, starting in this business with an initial capital of 17,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her back-breaking and capacious work, Orunbu achieved some measure of success in the development of her business and eventually started to receive a monthly profit of 8,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nOrunbu now owns two dairy cows and three horses.

Magno feels that this project really helps the community, and says that he, like many other youths from the area, earn a decent income cleaning roads, weeding pathways, and doing other tasks that help with maintenance.

Unfortunately, the unemployment rate in the region is very high and it is very difficult for Mariam's elder son and husband to find a job. So, in order to tackle the financial difficulties, this family got engaged in agriculture. Particularly, they own a plot of land where different types of fruits and vegetables are grown (peach, apricot, cherry, plum, apple and watermelon). The gathered harvest is sold locally and family is able to cover its daily costs. Now, in order to enlarge their farming business, Mariam and her family are asking for a loan. They will use this loan to purchase two oxen, a sow, and fertilizer for land cultivation. The loan is very important for them because by getting involved in cattle breeding, they will be able to get more agricultural products, which will increase their income.

Out of necessity and due to a lack of work opportunities, he decided to establish his own business making and selling all kinds of peanuts: caramelized, savory and sweet.  He learned on his own and works at home with support from his mother and wife.  Through his business he is able to earn enough income to support his household on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nFernando is a wise, hard-working, responsible, man who is passionate about his family and his work.  He is always looking for the best way to get ahead.  Therefore he is requesting a loan to buy fixed assets (a burner and large gas pipette) and raw material wholesale (peanuts, salt and sugar) to take advantage of the cash discounts.  This will allow him to continue his business and be more competitive on the market by offering good quality.  He will also increase his sales and advance toward his goal of positioning his product on the market.

Despite her young age, Alina has many years of experience in the agricultural field. She learned how to run a farm when she was a little girl.

Alina is also a mother of twin boys who are 3-years-old. The family's farm currently includes sheep, chickens, and turkeys. They cultivate tomato and grow apricot, apple, and pear trees. Alina and her mother-in-law take care of the farm by cultivating and raising different type of trees with great love and care, and the family's men sell the gathered harvest locally. As a result of their hard and tireless work, agriculture helps the family to have income and be able to sustain their living. Now, Alina with her hardworking family has applied for this loan in order to enlarge their farm. As this is Alina\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF.  The first-chance-loan program provides loans to people who don\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. The loan that Alina has requested will be used for purchasing fertilizer, which is very important for successful land cultivation. The loan will also cover fuel costs for transporting the gathered harvest to the market. Additional income would greatly assist this big family to cover their costs and improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":721.87,"image":{"id":1401566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for fertilizer for the land cultivation and cover fuel costs for her farming business.

Her husband also helps her to run grocery store and in other times, he drives around the city to render taxi services to local people. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has deteriorated over the years, so she is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass and foam to renovate her house. As a result, she and her husband can live in a comfortable and warm place. More importantly, they will reduce their coal consumption and release less pollutants into the air, which will contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

She lives with her husband, Augusto, with whom she has three children.  Marcelina looks after the children in her mother-in-law's house.  Marcelina's husband works in agriculture and every day goes out to his land - in the local town - to look after his corn and potato crops.  Marcelina has created a space in her house where she has good quality cages for raising guinea pigs, hens and rabbits.  Once old enough, she sells these animals.  Marcelina tells us that, thanks to her abilities in raising animals, she has high profits:  \"I live close to the city so meat vendors are constantly coming to my house to buy animals\".  Marcelina now wants to increase her number of animals in order to satisfy her buyers' demands.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a mother of four children. Her husband owns a crockery shop in the market.  This is the only source of income for the family. He sells variety of crockery in his shop. He is famous in his community market. All of his customers love the crockery he sells as he offer new variety to them.\r\n\r\nPresently Yasmeen's husband is interested in offering more variety to his customers.  This will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However due to the lack of funds, he finds it difficult. Therefore his wife Yasmeen has requested for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband purchase a variety of crockery with the goal of reselling them at profitable prices. With the profit amount, her husband wants to grow his business in the future. \r\n\r\nYasmeen is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Her husband is very hard-working and loves his family very much, making every effort to make sure that his family's needs are fully met. \r\n\r\nTo earn income to support the family, Rubina's husband is involved in a manufacturing and furniture sales business, where he makes and sells such items as beds and tables. He started this business over 10 years ago. \r\n\r\nRubina herself stays at home and looks after her children. Because her children are still very young, they need constant care. She also takes care of her elderly parents.\r\n\r\nToday, Rubina's husband has many regular customers and also takes orders from other cities. This business yields a good income, but the family's needs are increasing day by day, and Rubina finds that she needs more money in order to afford household expenses. In order to remedy this problem, she would like to request a loan in order to buy more raw materials for her husband to use for making furniture, allowing him to expand the business. This is why she came to BRAC Pakistan. \r\n\r\nShe wishes to obtain a loan of Rs. 45,000 so that her husband will be able to buy additional raw materials for making furniture. She is confident that this loan will prove beneficial and productive for his business as well as for the family.\r\n \r\nRubina offers her thanks to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan for this invaluable support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1402022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

Located 30 minutes from their home, they go there to maintain it and provide technical help.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative to buy soil amendments, urea, coffee formula, fertilizer, etc.  This way she can provide better help and greater protection as well as maintain her crops.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to graduate from college, help her parents as she has done up to the present, and have productive coffee crops that generate jobs and other things that appeal to her customers and other buyers in the area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1405998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Taulabe, Siguatepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-07T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-06T18:30:07Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eda Ebelinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":0.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070297},{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":0.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833732},{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.66,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":0.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710538},{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.42,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":0.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082616},{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":0.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490813013},{"amount":0.5,"local_amount":10.16,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":10.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504237134},{"amount":592.77,"local_amount":12063.39,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":12089.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530535651},{"amount":831.6,"local_amount":16923.53,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":16960.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542499183}],"funded_date":"2013-08-23T14:21:26Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:23:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":590768,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora, age 51 and widowed, is a rice farmer.

She lives with her husband, Pedro, with whom she has seven children.  They took care of and educated them, but now only her youngest daughter lives with them in their own house.\r\n\r\nHer main work focuses on agriculture.  She comes from a farming family, so when she was a little girl she learned what was necessary to set up her own fields.  When she started her family she began to grow peas, potatoes, beans, and other food products for her household.  She says they rented farmland but, little by little, with the help of their savings, they bought pieces of land to add to what they had gotten from their parents.  This is how they currently have various plots of land where they grow in quantity.  \r\n\r\nShe says she sells her harvest in a nearby city where she gets a good price for her food and they're able to earn more profits.  Now she wants to improve the quality of her crops and save for her old age.

She plans to improve it and continue selling, though.  Before she became a merchant she only studied and helped with the housework.  When she decided to get together with her partner, she had no other option than to make a living in sales to earn an income and cover her family necessities, because she didn't feel good about being with her mother and depending on her income.\r\n\r\nThe loan she's requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy four metal panels for the doors and windows, two sheets of corrugated metal for part of the roof, and seven pairs of hinges.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. \r\n\r\nMary Rose dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her next goal is to establish a website, but for now, she'll continue gaining referrals for future business through word of mouth.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1398083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase lighting equipment, backdrops, editing software, seating props and tripods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-08-07T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-06T21:00:07Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Crystal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":151.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":147.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":149.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":151.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":153.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":156.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":158.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":160.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":163.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":165.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":168.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":170.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":173.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":175.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":178.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":181.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":184.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":186.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":189.57},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":192.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":195.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":198.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":201.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":204.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":207.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":210.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":213.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":216.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":220.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":223.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.29},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.29},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":588629,"name":"Kyle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kyle lives in a rural area where he began a business cleaning equipment and water reclaiming systems for petrochemical businesses.

business, offering food services and soft drinks for five years now. Rose, who is in her mid-30s, works from 5am to 10pm daily and is able to receive a good profit per month. \r\n\r\nThis is Rose's tenth loan request with Tujijenge Tanzania which she will use to start selling beers. With the previous loans, all of which she managed to pay back successfully, she bought food-cooking items, like some kilos of rice, meat, tomatoes, onions, cooking oil, and flour. She replaced the old business equipment, like a gas stove instead of charcoal, and she bought chairs, tables, a refrigerator, and a TV.  \r\n\r\nThe profit generated from her business will be used to cover more school fees and home expenses. Rose also started building a house. She dreams that, one day, she will be able to finish building her family house. \r\n\r\nRose will share this loan with her loan group, Mikoroshini-1A Group, which totals six members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

She lives alongside her two children in the house she inherited from her mother.  During the first days of the week, she makes a living by working in public cleaning services for her government.  They pay her a monthly salary, but the economic activity she has developed for many years has been raising young animals such as sheep, pigs, and hens.\r\n\r\nAt first she lived in her mother's town, where she had sufficient space to raise the animals, but over time she moved to the city to improve her living conditions.  Thanks to this business, she could construct the house where today she educates her children.

She is the mother of 7 children: her 3 daughters stay at home and help their mother in daily routine work, her 2 sons are so young, and 2 sons are studying in the school.\r\n\r\nShe has to face a lot of problems to feed all of her children in a day and to fulfill all the household expenses due to low income. In fact, her husband is the only single earning person who has to afford all the household expenses through a single source of income, which is the computer accessories shop. He sells computer accessories such as mice, keyboards, monitors, sound cards, graphics cards, pen drives, etc. It is a challenge for him to sell his products in the market where there is a lot of competition.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual increase in the household expenses, he wants to grow his income as well. Therefore, Rubina requested a loan of 35,000 PKR from Kiva\u2019s field partner\u2019s BRAC Pakistan so that her husband would be able to buy more computer accessories for his shop. Rubina hopes that this loan will prove a productive one for the business and for her family also. \r\n\r\nRubina is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner\u2019s BRAC

area of Lahore, Pakistan. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a hawker and sells fruit in their hometown. He  goes daily to fruit markets to buy fresh fruit such as mangoes, bananas, apples, etc. He is very well-known in the community due to the freshness of his fruit. He has been selling fruit for many years; because of that, he understands the mind and demand of his clientele. \r\n\r\nDue to Ramadan the demand has increased and he wants to buy more fruit. In this way he would be able to fulfill the demand and can easily make more profit. Therefore, Shazia requested a loan of Rs.25,000 so that her husband would be able to buy more fruit, especially mangoes.\r\n\r\nShazia is representing herself as a group leader and taking the responsibility for her group members. This is Shazia's first loan; she firmly intends to pay all installments on time because she wants to take out another loan in the future. Shazia is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nNote: Shazia is raising her hand in the picture. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1402221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy fruit such as mangoes, apples, and bananas for resale.

She lives in her parents home located in a rural district.\r\n\r\nMerlinia works in agriculture and the cattle industry for a living. Two years ago she inherited a plot of land. There she grows potatoes, broad beans, peas and corn. She started cultivating all at once, but she realized that growing one product was more profitable due to the amount harvested. That's why this year she grew potatoes, which she sold successfully. Now she wants to grow corn and gladiolas since the climate and the month are favorable in order to obtain a good harvest and profits. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime she works taking care of her animals, from which she also obtains an income.

She has two minor children:  one son and one daughter.  Jyldyzkhan has a high school education.  Her neighbors have very good things to say about her.  They say she is a good and hard working woman.  Since 2009 the main source of her family's income has been Jyldyzkhan's business of selling dairy products.  She started her business with 30,000 som (KGS) and thanks to her hard work, she has been able to develop her business and increase her range of products and now her business brings in about 5,000 som (KGS) per month.  This is the basis for covering her family's expenses for food and daily needs.  Her profits have also enabled her to increase her turnover.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Jyldyzkhan applied to the microcredit bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) for the wholesale purchase of dairy products for her inventory.   Jyldyzkhan plans to reinvest the profits from her loan in further expanding her business and, in the future, she wants to give her children a decent education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1402205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk

She grew up with her grandmother and all her needs were provided for by her grandmother who was a farmer. When Patricia completed senior six her grandmother could not afford to pay university fees for her, so she then dropped out of school to help her grandmother on the farm. \r\n\r\nDue to the fact that she was keen to take care of herself, Patricia ended up starting her own business of selling secondhand clothes and shoes.

This is 42-year-old Salamatu from Jui eastern area in Freetown. She is married with two children, 13 years and 20 years old. Her children are attending school. She started business because she wants to generate income to support her needs.\r\n\r\nSalamatu runs a local cooked food business; she sells cake and fried chicken. She has been running this business for over seven years. She works at the business 11 hours per day, 7 days per week. Salamatu says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nSalamatu has requested a loan in order to purchase foods including flour, ketchup, cooking seasonings and soft drinks. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her capital and pay her children's school fees. In the future, she plans to open a big restaurant. She thanks you for your support\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1402375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
