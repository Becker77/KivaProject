from Sierra Leone! This is 35-year-old Hawa from Jui, Eastern area in Freetown. She is married with three children between the ages of three and 15. Two of her children are attending school. For the past three years, Hawa has been running a cookery business. She sells prepared cooked food from home and she works 11 hours a day, seven days a week. Hawa started her business because she wanted to generate income to support her needs. Her major business challenge is price inflation.\r\n\r\nHawa is requesting a loan to purchase food commodities such as rice, palm oil, cooking seasonings, and soft drinks. She will use the extra income from her loan to increase her capital and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Hawa plans to open a big restaurant. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1402474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict

She is the head of her family and lives with her two children, who are 7 and 15 years old. \r\n\r\nHer business is making and selling fried foods and juices. In order to please her clients she accompanies these foods with pastries and soft drinks. She started this business a year ago as she needed to make some money from her home. She had to stop working for the private firm where she had been working for 13 years for medical reasons. She buys the ingredients and some of the ready made products with cash in the market in the center of Barranquilla. She sells to neighbors and others passing through her neighborhood, on a cash basis only, from Monday to Sunday, 6:30 am to 8 pm,\r\n\r\nThis is her first Kiva loan through la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the loan to buy  flour, cheese, fruit, salt, oil, sugar, and other ingredients needed to make the fried foods and juices, as well as buying pastries and soft drinks.

Muhtarama has four children, and despite being divorced and having to raise the children herself, she never lost heart and continued onward. \r\n\r\nOf course it was very hard for her to raise and support her children, but she has striven for them to always be fed and clothed.

She works with selling seasonal clothing. She has managed this business for more than 13 years. She purchases goods at the wholesale market and brings them to her village to sell. This business gives her a good income. \r\n\r\nMuhtarama would like to increase the income received, and therefore she needs to expand the business. As it is currently the season for selling school clothing, Muhtarama would like to purchase more goods and expand her business. She turned to \"Arvand\" for a loan in order to purchase clothing to sell.

over-populated, and has rooms for rent that are a bit cheaper, with the option of travelling. He is married and has four children aged between 19 and 12, who live with him and attend school; his wife is a businesswoman. Papa has been running a shop for the past five years now, selling artificial hair and clothes.

Lahore, Pakistan. She belongs to a happy family because her husband and son earn sufficient income to meet daily household expenses. Her son has been running a mobile repairing shop since 2004 in a nearby town. He is very professional and experienced in his work; most of the clients become his close friends and like to have their mobiles repaired by him. Her husband is very hardworking and honest. He demands very low service charges for his services; that is why people like to have their mobiles repaired by him. Due to his honesty and low rates he has created a good reputation and goodwill in his community. \r\n\r\nHis shop is situated in a populated area. A few days ago someone stole some electronic parts from his shop; now he is unable to repair mobile phones. He does not have much savings to buy these electronic parts again. \r\n\r\nMumtaz requested a loan of PKR 35,000 from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her son would be able to buy electronic parts to carry on his business. She hopes that through this loan more customers will be attracted toward his shop, which will lead to an increase in income and savings. She praises the lenders and is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

He has received four loans from PAC that were repaid on time and according to terms.  Having this money has helped to maintain his farm.  In this past crop cycle, the yield per 1.74 acres of his farm was 30 quintals of coffee beans in parchment (1 quintal = 46 kg).  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this crop cycle, Marlon is requesting a loan that will secure the maintenance of his coffee farm.  He hopes to improve production, in terms of both quantity and quality, so that he can generate better income.  His goal is to continue investing in the productivity of his farm so that his children can have a better future.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1406109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy supplies to maintain his coffee farm.

His wife is a housewife and she helps him with his business. They are both on a pension, but they do not sit idly by. In search of a source of income for his family, Shavraly started working with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding in 1993. Having started with a sum of 30,000 som (KGS), his business currently brings in a monthly profit of around 9,000 som (KGS). His business includes three horses, four dairy cows with offspring and 60 sheep. \r\n\r\nShavraly also has a plot of land of the size of 2.40 hectares, where he mainly grows beans and perennial grasses. The eldest son, who is a migrant worker in Russia, also sends additional financial aid. \r\n\r\nTo further develop his business, Shavraly turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tuhsum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to purchase sheep. Shavraly plans to spend the income from the loan on increasing the number of livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1402964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Her husband and children help her with the business. \r\n\r\nThanks to Naarkul's persistent work, she currently has a good farm: One dairy cow, one steer and five sheep. She also has 3.15 hectares of irrigated land available, on which she plants wheat and barley every year. The income allowed Naarkul to multiply the number of livestock at the far, and thereby improve the family's well-being. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Naarkul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of steers.

He identified his passion early and decided to pursue it. Peter built and sold his first aquarium in 2009, and he has not looked back since. He has successfully sold aquariums to family, friends, and others. Based on his dedication and enthusiasm, today he has more than 15 aquariums that he also services. \n\nPeter is the first born in a family of three children and was inspired to venture into entrepreneurship by his grandfather who is a successful entrepreneur.

He dedicated his productive life to working as an employee in a friend's barber shop, where he obtained knowledge and experience in this line of work. Three years ago he decided to become independent and opened his own barber shop in the neighborhood where he lives. He took advantage of the fact that he has no competition in the area, so up to now it has gone very well for him. Juan is an energetic, active, responsible young man with an entrepreneurial spirit. He is always looking for options that will allow him to improve his standard of living. This is why he is asking for the loan to buy stock items and work supplies (hair gel, spray, dye, shampoo, and gloves, among others) with the goal of providing better service and offering quality products to his customers, which will help him to improve his sales and have more income to provide daily sustenance to his household.

","en":"Tinatin is 59 years old, married, and is the mother of as many as six children (four sons and two daughters). She has specialized secondary education. For many years, she worked in sales. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, and after having lost her job, she has since 1994 worked with farming - livestock breeding and field crop cultivation - after having started this business with a sum of 500 som (KGS). Her husband and children actively help her with the business.\r\n\r\nThanks to Tinatin's persistent work, she currently has a good farm: One foal, two dairy cows, 20 sheep and 10 lambs. She also has a plot of land available, on which she grows potatoes, bread and corn. The income allowed Tinatin to multiply the number of livestock in her family and at the same time increase the family's well-being. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business Tinatin turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of a cow with offspring. Tinatin plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number livestock, and also to improve the financial situation of the

This is 40-year-old Fatmata from Waterloo eastern area in Freetown. She is married with three children between the ages of 7 years and 20 years old. Her children attend school. She started business to earn her daily survival income for her family.\r\n \r\nFatmata runs a cooked food business. She sells cooked food at her house, and she has been running this business since 2005. She works at the business from 4:30 am, and she will not rest until the food is finished.   Fatmata says that the main challenge to her business is the problem of price control in the market.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy food ingredients like cooking seasoning, oil and rice. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and develop her cooked food stand. In the future, she plans to have a restaurant. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1402953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married with 4 children, from age 7 to 20 years.  In 2005, Adama established her palm oil business. She began her business because she generates her own source of income. She works at the business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nAdama requires a loan in order to purchase more palm oil to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and increase her business. In the future, Adama plans to expand her business even more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1402955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married with 5 children from age 3 years to 22 years. In 2003, Mamusu established her food stock business. She began her business because she was a housewife but she wanted to create her own source of income to contribute to taking care of the children. She works at the business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and the high cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nMamusu requires a loan in order to purchase rice, cooking seasonings and coconut oil to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and increase her business. In the future, Mamusu plans to expand her business more.

This is 45-year-old Isatu from Tombo in the Western rural area in Freetown. She is married and blessed with 6 children between the ages of 8 years and 27 years. Two of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nIsatu runs a cookery business at home. She sells cooking items at her house. She has been running this business since 2007. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Isatu says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation and insufficient finances to expand her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items like rice, palm oil and cooking seasonings. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to open a big restaurant. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1402973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy more cooking items like rice, palm oil and cooking seasonings.

She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to buy more used clothing for resale.

Elmira plans to sell a wide assortment of well-priced clothing for men, women, and children.

She is married with 2 children, ages 10 years and 15 years. Her children are currently attending school. In 2010, Kadiatu established her palm oil business. She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to buy gallons of palm oil for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and renovate her house. In the future Kadiatu plans to own a big shop. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1402992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She described herself as a good businesswoman. \r\n\r\nFor the past four years, she has been selling soft drinks in the local market. She started this business with money given to her by her child's father, who is a driver. She enjoys her business because the business gives her more money to sustain herself and her child. She sells from Monday to Saturday for four hours. Most of the time, she uses a bus to get her goods to her table that she sells from. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to purchase more soft drinks for her business. Her plans are to build a house, to educate her child and get married in the near future. She thanks BRAC Liberia for connecting borrowers and the lenders.

She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Mary says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation and insufficient finances to expand her business.\r\n\r\nMary has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items like rice, palm oil and cooking seasonings. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to build a house.

2. Chelsea attended grade school and stopped her studies in the 7th grade. Two of her children are staying with their father and three are staying with her at home. She stated that she is aware that the two children with their father are in school. Among the three who live with her, only two are attending school, while the young one stays at home with her. \r\n\r\nChelsea explained how she has been going to the wholesale center to buy cassava, coconut and peanuts by the bag to resell. She sells from 8am to 5pm Monday to Saturday. She uses a bike to lug her goods from the village to the main road and uses a taxi from the main road to the city of Paynesville south, in Monrovia, Liberia. \r\n\r\nShe started this business by selling corn from the roadside with a little money from her mother, who taught her how to do this out-of-town-business. Chelsea expressed how she loves the buying, and she is proud of her business because she believes God directs more customers to her business every day, and that can cause her goods to be sold quicker. \r\n\r\nShe plans to buy a piece of land and build a house. Also she hopes that her children will have a bright future, as she is trying her best to educate them. She gives thanks to the lenders of Kiva for supporting the program and empowering small business people. God should bless them.

He dedicated his working life to making a living as an employee in a shoe factory, where he gained knowledge and experience in this trade. This enabled him to go independent and set up his own workshop in his home. Here, he makes sandals, trainers, shoes, and boots, which he sells in different towns in Antioquia department. He has been doing this for 13 years, and it has enabled him to make enough earnings to support his household. \r\n\r\nOrlando is a creative, dynamic, enterprising and enthusiastic person. He works long hours to make money for his family and find new ways to move forwards.

She is a mother of three children, all of whom are dependent on her and still in school. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Den and her husband have been growing rice for several years.

She is married to Wilfredo, a driver, and is mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nAvelina operates a recycling shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to recycling shops for a little profit. These shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1000 in sales every day.  Avenlina also has a piggery for additional income. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Avenlina is requesting a PHP 23,000 loan. She will be incorporating this loan to her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAvelina dreams that her business will flourish and her children will finish their studies.

She used her ideas in her Economics and Politics classes when she had to create a business with her classmates by taking charge of the creation and design of the logo, name, placard, brochures and flyers to sell their product (caramels).\r\n\r\nWhen she started Year 10 she took classes in Science, Technology, Graphic Design and Audiovisual Media where she learnt how to design web pages and began studies in photography, bas relief and high relief, volume and shadow in objects. \r\n\r\nDayanna\u2019s short term goal is to enrol in an institution where she can gain better knowledge that will lead her to a great career.\r\n\r\nHer medium term goal is to graduate from a vocational college in Graphic Design and Advertising and to be working in a company where she can put her studies into practice and continue helping her parents and her sisters.\r\n\r\nDayanna\u2019s long term goal is to set up her own advertising company to offer employment opportunities to young people who have the same interest in advertising so that they can fund their studies while they are young. With the fruits of her labour she will buy a house and a car, continue in her profession and obtain a Master\u2019s degree. \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1405313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to obtain an education in graphic design and advertising at Corporaci\u00f3n Las Mercedes  vocational college ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-09T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-08T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dayanna Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":770000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":154.55,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":292013.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780597},{"amount":41.4,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":78218.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539972},{"amount":26.92,"local_amount":48765,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50857.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752500},{"amount":202.13,"local_amount":366235,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-29T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":381948.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845807}],"funded_date":"2013-08-10T00:45:03Z","paid_date":"2013-12-29T09:39:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":591496,"name":"Noeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noeun (in the photo) is 42 years old.

Manuel has worked in agriculture since he was very young. He remembers how the inhabitants of his area helped each other on their farms, and thus he knows that working as a team leads to better results. Currently, he grows potatoes and peas on his farmland, together with his older children who work with him to support their children. Since he has this support, he does not need laborers from the area. In addition, he says that thanks to this agricultural work, he has been able to help his children get ahead, and thus he considers it profitable work. Although he does not always obtain a good harvest, due to pests or the weather, he says that he always earns some money by selling to the wholesalers in the city. He also works raising cattle, which he sells whenever he faces some kind of difficulty. And since he is an enterprising man, he plans to buy more cattle, since he would like to expand this business.
