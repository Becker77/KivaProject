Together, she and her husband can earn about 28,000KHR per day to meet the family\u2019s needs and manage to save about 14,000KHR each day for future needs.\r\n\r\nSreypheap\u2019s group is with VisionFund for this cycle. Now she is leading her group to ask for a loan. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy fertilizer and seeds for her farmland. With this loan, she hopes to grow her rice fruitfully and healthily and also hopes to make more income to improve her standard of living and keep her children in school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1403415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and seeds for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Cheung Prey district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-08-10T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-09T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sreypheap","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Souy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1525130.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504420773}],"funded_date":"2013-08-13T19:31:38Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T18:57:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Cipolla","image":418546}},{"id":591522,"name":"Manora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manora is a young, smart, 18-year-old woman.

It is here we find Jonni, who is 46 years old and has four children, ages 17, 15, 13 and 12, with his common-law wife. The eldest is in college, and the youngest three are in school. His wife works at a tuna factory. Jonni is a hardworking man who thanks to his efforts and his wife's help is able to make headway. He works at a local gas station but he also runs a small business out of his home. He has some pool tables, and at night many people come to play. He also sells water, sodas, juices and different sandwiches to earn extra income, since what he and his wife make on their own isn't enough to pay the bills or even cover their children's education expenses, which are costly. With the loan, he plans to purchase water, sodas, juices, snacks and other items to sell. He has been with the community bank for five years and likes the loans so he can better stock his business.

So, Shota decided to start his own business with a loan.  Unfortunately, the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  As a result of not satisfying these requirements, his credit requests were rejected several times.  \r\n\r\nShota received the credit in the framework of a start-up program, which is a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  This program enables the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  With a credit of $3,500, Shota will purchase tires for his truck.  Once tires are purchased, he will be able to work in transportation and generate income.  It is obvious that the job is hard, as he will sometimes need to drive long distances.

John began his business to acquire some income to support his family.\r\n\r\nWith his portion of the loan, John would like to buy more passionfruit. He will buy mulch for the passionfruit and also restock some of the passionfruit plants to increase his sales. It is the hot season so the mulch will help to maintain the moisture in the soil. He hopes that the loan will help him to take his business to another level.\r\n\r\nJohn's main challenges are diseases and poor transport. He is hard working, resilient, honest and dependable.\r\n\r\nThe tenth person, pictured on the extreme right, is the group chairperson who signed the waiver form and is not listed on this group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5550,"image":{"id":1403447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to buy mulch and more passionfruit plants to increase his stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mpigi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.083333 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:01Z","loan_amount":5550,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sulaiman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Twahiri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mulinde","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abasi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abasi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yasin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muhamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":14300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":5550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1787500},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1787500},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1787500},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1787500},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1787500},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1787500},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1787500},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1787500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":693.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":1787500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1791245.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480957},{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":1787500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1791245.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880114},{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":1787500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1791245.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983778},{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":1787500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1791245.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635871},{"amount":654.94,"local_amount":1687500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1691036.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863311},{"amount":654.94,"local_amount":1687500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1691036.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752391},{"amount":746.03,"local_amount":1922201,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1926228.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233387},{"amount":719.09,"local_amount":1852799,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1856681.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468058900}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T17:06:19Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T17:10:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Revie","image":692978}},{"id":591546,"name":"Goderdzi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Goderdzi is 34 years old.

For this reason, Goderdzi decided to start a dairy farm. Goderdzi's loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with reasonable terms to start-up businesses. These loans are provided to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low incomes. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase a milking cow. Goderdzi will house the cow in the cattle shed located in his yard, and he will sell the milk at the local market. He estimates that the family's income will increase by 150 to 200 GEL, which is a 40 to 50 percent increase. The family's living conditions will significantly improve, enabling them to access regular credit products that are currently

He lives in the Khashuri District with his mother, wife and an infant child. Datuna\u2019s mother is retired and gets a monthly pension. Datuna runs a small scale agricultural business and grows grapes, maize and beans on his own plot of land. The harvest is sold at the local open market. In addition, Datuna is a builder and works on orders from time to time. However, his income is not enough for the family and they live in poverty. They receive a small social assistance benefit from the government. \r\n\r\nDatuna has requested a loan to start a dairy farm. His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with reasonable terms to start-up businesses. These loans are provided to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low incomes. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used for purchasing a milking cow. Datuna will house the cow in the cattle shed located in his yard, and will start selling the milk at the local market. The family's income will increase by 150\u2013200 GEL (Georgian Lari), which is a 40 to 50 percent increase. The family's living conditions will significantly improve and the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1403457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

She provides her services at a very reasonable price and that's why her work is increasing day by day.\r\n\r\nSajda,as a member of a three-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. She wants to expand her business by purchasing one more sewing machine. She would be able to stitch dresses more appropriately and efficiently in less time with a new sewing machine. This would increase her net income and savings. She would spend the profit amount on the education of her children.

She is pictured with her hand raised, on the extreme left. Twelve women members from the village joined hands and formed the group to support and assist each other financially and morally in times of need. The presence of Dorcas SHG and Sarah SHG in the village gives awareness about the advantage and benefit of a Self Help Group and its existence. All group members reside in a village which is about 35 kms away from the capital town of Imphal, which is one of the North-Eastern States in India.\r\n\r\nDimngai is a hard-working woman and believes in sheer effort to make a living. She raises cattle to generate an income for the family. Her husband earns his living as a farmer and she supplements the family income by raising cattle and weaving traditional women's wrap-around skirts. At present she has two female cows which produce milk. The milk is then sold every day in the neighbourhood. Her daily expenses are managed with her income from selling cow's milk. The cattle are also used on rental for ploughing paddy fields where tractors are not available and the payment is made based on the acres of land that are ploughed. \r\n\r\nDimngai usually gets the nutritional diet for cattle from the city market to keep the cattle healthy and strong. The cattle are also fed grass and refined dry grass. They are taken to the nearby fields to graze all day and feed on grass. Medical needs are provided on a regular basis whereas cattle are made to work at heavy labour and little care is granted by others. Most of the earnings are generally used to care for the cattle and cover household expenses. \r\n\r\nDimngai also weaves and sells finished woven wrap-around skirts to those who place an order. Despite working as a weaver and a cattle raiser she finds it hard to manage any monthly savings and she needs to renovate the cattle cow shed which leaked during the rainy season. The cattle are moved from the cow shed to a nearby shelter during rain.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Dimngai will purchase tin roofing, bricks and cement to re-construct the cow shed. She is delighted as the cattle will be kept in a protected shelter and she loves her cattle. She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful gift of a loan and says that she will repay the loan on time and will continue building good relationships with the organisation. She says \u201cThank you so much, Kiva!\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, piggery, vegetable selling, and the rice selling business, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1402956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase tin roofing, bricks and cement to reconstruct the cow shed for the cattle that she raises to generate an income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-10T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-09T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dimngai`","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimhoirei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhochin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neijahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nempi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thangkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikhokip","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T23:05:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":591596,"name":"Johnson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Johnson lives in Mombasa where he operates his own carpentry shop.

yeas old, married, and has two children.  She has a higher education, and for a long time she worked as a high school teacher.  Today, she and her husband are retired, but they don't just sit around the house, rather they run their own small farm.  This is a business that Ainagul started in 1985 to be a source of income for her family.  She started the business with 2,000 som (KGS), but the good relationships that the family members have among themselves have allowed them to be successful.  Today her farm brings in a monthly profit of 10,000 som (KGS).  Ainagul has one milk cow and ten sheep.  She also has 1.2 hectares of land where she mainly grows beans and peppers.\r\n\r\nTo further develop her business, Ainagul applied to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy cows.  Ainagul plans to use the profits from the loan to increase the size of her herd of cattle and she intends to spend some money on repairing her

She has her own grocery shop and works there. In addition, she is involved in agricultural activities. Specifically, she has a plot of land where nut trees are grown. She sells the harvested nuts at local markets at a good price. \r\n\r\nTamar decided to start a dairy business with the loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  Tamar\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received the credit in the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo - the Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of 4,000 Gel, she will purchase a milk cow and a stock of groceries for her shop. \r\n\r\nWhen the milk cow is purchased, she will be able to produce dairy products and sell them at her shop. She will also purchase a wide range of products to satisfy her customer\u2019s requirements. With this financial support Tamar will expand her grocery store, attract more customers, and expand the dairy farm. \r\n\r\nShe promises to make her repayments on

Los clientes que ella tiene son bodegas que exclusivamente se dedican a la compra-venta de caf\u00e9 en otras localidades cercanas de donde ella vive.\n\nElla ha solicitado un financiamiento a la cooperativa COMIXMUL que permitir\u00e1 adquirir suministros agr\u00edcolas, como chapola (plantitas de caf\u00e9), tambi\u00e9n comprara abono y otra parte la destinara para la preparaci\u00f3n de una manzana de tierra que ser\u00e1 donde siembre la chapola que comprara y as\u00ed al final del proceso obtener una excelente producci\u00f3n. \n\nSu mayor anhelo y m\u00e1s grande sue\u00f1o es poder graduar a sus 4 hijos de la universidad para que en el futuro puedan valerse por s\u00ed mismos ya que con lo que ellos ganan no les alcanza para dejarles un patrimonio digno y puedan enfrentar de manera favorable los problemas econ\u00f3micos.\n","en":"Cidian is a 28-year-old young lady who is of farming age and is a housewife. She is the mother of four children. The oldest is 15 and is in her first year of high school away from home, studying business administration. Her second child is 13 and is studying her second year of the basic core curriculum. Her third child is eight and is in her second year of school, and the youngest of her children is five and is in preschool. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband make a living cultivating coffee, performing tasks such as cleaning, composting, cutting, collecting, and other things. She learned how to do this alongside her parents when she was a child, since they are farmers by family tradition and the land they work together is their own thanks to a family inheritance. It is located close to their home. The clients she has are warehouses that are exclusively dedicated to the buying and selling of coffee in other locations near where she lives.\r\n\r\nShe has requested financing from the Comixmul cooperative in order to be able to acquire agricultural supplies such as coffee seedlings, as well as to buy compost. The rest will be used in the preparation of a 7000 square meter parcel of land that will be where she sows the coffee seedlings that she will buy, and that way at the end of this process she will have excellent production.\r\n\r\nHer greatest desire and biggest dream is to be able to have her four children graduate from universities so that in the future they can fend for themselves, since with what she and her husband earn, they will not have enough to leave them a worthy inheritance. This way, they will be able to take on their economic problems in a favorable way."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1407255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies and coffee seedlings to plant, and to maintain her coffee crops.

El titular es un joven activo, din\u00e1mico, emprendedor y dedicado a su familia y a sus labores. Se decide a solicitar el cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas (abonos, fungicidas, larvicidas, fertilizantes) y adem\u00e1s pagar\u00e1 30 horas de alquiler de tractor (valor de cada hora $38.000) con el fin de darle continuidad al cuidado de sus cultivos y tener una cosecha con productos de muy buena calidad, para venderlos a mejor precio en el mercado, lo que le permitir\u00e1 aumentar sus ingresos para darle el sustento diario a su familia.

","en":"Luis, 22, is father to a 1-year-old baby and lives in a common-law marriage with his partner. Eight years ago, he learned to work in the fields, since he worked with his father. For 5 years, he has been working on a farm as a milker. His work alternates with agricultural activity, as he owns Creole potato and bean crops on a small leased plot. The loan recipient is an active, dynamic, enterprising young man and is devoted to his family and his work. \r\n\r\nLuis decided to request this loan to invest in the purchase of agricultural supplies (manure, fungicides, larvicides, and fertilizer) and to also pay to rent a tractor for 30 hours (each hour is worth $38,000 Colombian pesos) in order to give continuity to the care of his crops and have a harvest with high quality products. This way, he can sell them at a better price in the market, which will allow him to increase his revenue in order to give daily livelihood to his family.\r\n\r\nLuis dreams of owning a plot where he could have his crops, thus saving the money that he pays to lease land. That will be reflected in higher profitability and will allow him to have economic stability so that his child grows and develops in a healthy environment with better living conditions and well-being."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1407289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies (manure, fungicides, larvicides, and fertilizer) and to also pay to rent a tractor for 30 hours.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-10T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-09T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alfredo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":119994},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":123284},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":126665},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":130138},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":133706},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":137372},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":141139},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145009},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":148985},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":153071},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":157268},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":161580},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166011},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":170563},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175239},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":180044},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":184981},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":190053},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":195265},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200619},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":206120},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":211772},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":217578},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":223544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Eddy","image":1377564}},{"id":593940,"name":"Nolvia Aracely","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nolvia, tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene tres hijos y vive con su esposo en una aldea del municipio de Macuelizo, Santa B\u00e1rbara.

two kids who are in school. Currently, her main source of income relies on her one hectare cassava farming area and on working for others for a fee for extra income. Vannak is not new to VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

successful business. For at least five years, Donna worked in the party supply industry and recently decided to take the challenge of working for herself.\r\n\r\nBefore she could open her newly-rented storefront, Donna needed working capital to purchase moonwalks to rent out, and pi\u00f1atas, candy, decorations, balloons and other party supplies to sell in her town of Nixon, Texas, serving the San Antonio area.

She also sells herbal products and gulaman con sago (gelatin and pearls) for additional income. She and her husband, who works in an office, are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 10,000 PHP loan for her to buy more herbal medicines and food supplements that she will sell to her customers. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and educational expenses of her child. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJane hopes to have her own stall for her business and dreams to give her family a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

He is an irresponsible person and does not care about his children. She has to prove herself a responsible and brave mother. During the six years she has attained a regular list of customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income.\r\n\r\nTo cope with the increasing demand of her customers, Samina requested a loan of 30,000 PKR from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, to purchase thread, fancy cloth, sequins, and pearls of various colors. She is representing herself as the group leader and is taking the responsibility for her group members.\r\n\r\nShe does not want to lose heart and wants to afford all household expenses with courage. She hopes that this loan will prove beneficial for her and for her family. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nNote: Samina is raising her hand in the given picture.

Due to a lack of work opportunities, he decided to start his own business and find resources on his own. He put together the pizzeria two years ago, taking advantage of the opportunity of not having nearby competition, achieving excellent results that are now reflected in the opening of two other pizzerias, which are located in other municipalities of Antioquia. Edwin is an organized, enterprising, sensible, and active man. He is always looking for opportunities to move toward completing his goals. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, he is requesting a loan, which he wants to invest in improving his locations (change the cement floor to ceramic) and buy fixed assets (refrigerator) for one of his locations.

In addition, he runs a small dairy farm, milking a cow and producing cheese, which is sold locally. In addition to his agricultural activities, Ilia works as a senior mechanic on marine ships and gets a small monthly salary (approximately 150 USD). \r\n\r\nAs the family's income is not enough for food and everyday expenses, Ilia decided to start a business breeding fish, for which we sought credit from local financial institutions, however his attempts was unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

Her son owns an enterprise of stitching and selling embroidery by machine in his nearby town. He has had this business since 2005. He has been recruiting workers for embroidery work on daily wages; he also brings some material to home for his sister because his sister helps him with embroidery work. He is an expert in his profession, and he is especially famous for bridal dresses; people like him for his arts and appreciate his efforts.\r\n \r\nNow, the marriage season is going to start, and there is a lot of demand for his art. He wants to cope with the demand for bridal dresses, which is why he wants to buy stocks of threads, fancy cloths, sequins, and pearls of various colors in advance.\r\n\r\nRazia requires some capital to buy the desired items for her son but she does not have a sufficient amount. So she humbly requested a loan of 35,000 PKR from BRAC Pakistan. With this loan, her son will be able to buy stocks of threads, fancy cloths, sequins, and pearls of various colors.\r\n\r\nRazia is very glad and thankful to BRAC

Along with her husband, she works every day in the planting, cleaning, harvesting, fertilizing, and irrigation of vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, tomatoes, sweet chiles, etc., since some time ago, on her own initiative, she decided to learn to work the land. Her products are commercialized and sold in the local shops, through intermediaries, and principally in the market of her zone.\r\n\r\nShe has applied to the COMIXMUL cooperative for a loan with which she will maintain her vegetable plantings through the purchase of fertilizers, compost, and insecticides, among other products that will keep her plantings free of pests in general.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to construct her house someday, believing in God that it will be, since the economy of the country is not in the best condition, and construction materials are not cheap. As a mother, her desire is to be able to give her children a quality education so that they can excel in the future, decide to form their own households, have jobs, and manage their own dealings with humility. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1407373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies for her vegetable crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Siguatepeque, Comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-11T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-10T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":0.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710539},{"amount":499.97,"local_amount":9999.5,"processed_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10203.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082553}],"funded_date":"2013-08-12T02:48:17Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:09:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":593976,"name":"Ofelia Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ofelia, a sus 64 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica a la fabricaci\u00f3n y venta de arepas de ma\u00edz, actividad que realiza desde hace aproximadamente 12 a\u00f1os y que inici\u00f3 gracias a cr\u00e9ditos anteriores, con esto ha logrado apoyar al sostenimiento de su hogar. \u201cMi edad no me impide que trabaje, pues me gusta sentirme \u00fatil y todav\u00eda puedo hacer muchas cosas, me gusta que la gente compre mis productos diariamente y eso me anima para seguir luchando\u201d; con estas palabras Ofelia expresa su motivaci\u00f3n para seguir siempre adelante, por esta raz\u00f3n solicita otro cr\u00e9dito, para invertirlo  en la compra de materia prima al por mayor (ma\u00edz) con lo que podr\u00e1 tener disponibilidad de producto para cumplir con la producci\u00f3n diaria y entregar los pedidos a tiempo, as\u00ed podr\u00e1 incrementar sus ventas y fidelizar los clientes actuales, adem\u00e1s tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de  generar m\u00e1s ingresos para llegar a cumplir el sue\u00f1o de montar otro negocio de comidas, que le permita seguir aportando a la econom\u00eda de su hogar y mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia.","en":"Ofelia is 64 years old.

He obtains his agricultural supplies from various agricultural service centers in the city, and he transports them by car to the entrance of the village, and from there he has to carry them through the mountains to his house, a walk of approximately 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nThe loan will help this borrower so that he can buy his agricultural supplies for planting beans. With the loan, he states that he will buy 200 lbs of urea and 1800 lbs of compost to fertilizer the beans. With this method, he will be able to give good management to the crop, improving his production and thus being able to have more income and also being able to take out his basic grains to feed his children well.\r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to build a new house, so that his children can have a healthier place to play and his future generations can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1407389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 200 lbs of urea and 1800 lbs of compost to fertilize his planting of beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-11T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-10T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":36.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":37.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":42.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":33.2,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":33.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090855},{"amount":41.2,"local_amount":41.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":41.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856852},{"amount":39.38,"local_amount":39.38,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":39.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505123},{"amount":28.86,"local_amount":28.86,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":28.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716203},{"amount":34.77,"local_amount":34.77,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":34.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449621838},{"amount":40.44,"local_amount":40.44,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":40.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088077},{"amount":40.29,"local_amount":40.29,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902343},{"amount":41.86,"local_amount":41.86,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":41.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215542}],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T03:31:30Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:12:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":593980,"name":"Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Antonio es un hombre soltero de 24  a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a sus padres y hermanos en el Caser\u00edo Xolb\u00e9, El Tabl\u00f3n Solol\u00e1, Solol\u00e1.\nEl es un hombre agricultor que trabaja fuerte para mantener  a su familia.

With this loan of 2000 GEL (Georgia Lari) she will purchase clothing and household items at wholesale prices in Turkey and resell them in her community door-to-door. She plans to sell a wide assortment of well-priced clothing for men, women and children and bedclothes as well. It is obvious that the job is hard for Tinatin, but she is ready to deal with the vital difficulties and develop her business gradually.

He has a lot of customers who like to buy fabrics from him; sometimes he purchases fabrics from out of the city at low cost and sells them to the retailers. He has a good reputation in the market and his current customers refer his fabrics to the other retailers, which becomes the cause of his advertisement. One of her sons also helps her husband in the clothing business; both are partially giving their time to the shop. \r\n\r\nFazilat requested a loan of PKR 45,000 from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband would be able to buy more fabrics to fulfill the demand. She is in her seventh loan cycle and has shown excellent repayment behavior. She has already been taking a loan from BRAC and investing in the business.

The source of income for the family is the monthly salary earned by Arut\u2019s wife, working as a teacher at the public school. Unfortunately, a teacher\u2019s salary is not enough to make ends meet for a family of three. \r\n\r\nArut purchased a car a month ago, but the family savings was not enough to pay the toll and change the fuel system. He plans to serve the locals as a taxi driver but he would have to charge higher prices for his service because the price of benzene is high. Not many citizens could afford to use the taxi service at a higher price. Because of the above mentioned problem, Arut will change his car's fuel system from benzene to gas, which is cheaper than benzene and will reduce the cost of transportation by 40 to 45 percent. It will allow Arut to offer cheap service to his customers. \r\n\r\nWith this startup loan, he will pay the toll and a local auto service center to change the fuel system. Arut will start his taxi business and help the family in covering food and everyday expenses. The increased income will be used for the family's well being.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1404374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

Her husband owns a paint workshop in which he provides the services to paint the bodies of auto rickshaws. He paints old and damaged bodies using paint spray guns.  The paint gun works through the air pressure. He has been providing these services for many years and has a good reputation in the market.  A few days ago, his spray gun broke and he is low on his stock of paint. He does not have money to buy spray guns and paint because he already spent his savings on the maintenance of his workshop.  Therefore, Rukhsana requested a loan for her husband so that her husband would be able to buy a new spray gun and paint to carry on his business.\r\n\r\nRukhsana says thank you to all of our field

He has no children and has been doing dairy work for 5 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs and crops.\r\n\r\nHe stated what he finds most enjoyable about farming is getting profits. His biggest challenge is the lack of finances. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Keroi and Lelkina.\r\n\r\nStanley was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied, \"Because of the dairy insurance.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"They assist smallholder farmers.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs.

The animals on his farm have been given the names of 'Murgut'  and 'Chenwach.' Kibii was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'They give a 2 months grace period.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: Juhudi Kilimo assists smallholder farmers.' Kibii's highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Kibii replied 'It will assist in paying school fees.' As part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Kibii owns the following: 'cow and poultry' but does not own 'a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

Celestina tells us that she joined Pro Mujer two years ago, following an invitation from one of the organisation's representatives who went to visit her in her home.  Celestina currently has a business making knitting products and selling beds.  She says that she learned this trade some years ago from a woman who helped her.

She has two years of experience running her tortilla business, as she worked as an employee in one for 5 years. They paid her $3.00 a day, but seeing that what she earned was not enough to support her family, she decided to set up her own business. Her two children study in the sixth grade and her partner works as a labourer in sugar cane plantations earning $4.00 a day.  \r\n\r\nHer business is in her home and she starts work at 7:00 in the morning, cooking corn. She then takes it to be ground up and and 9:00 she starts making the tortillas, finishing at 13:00 in the afternoon. She then begins the whole process again at 15:00 and finishes at 18:30. She works alone and invests her earnings in buying household goods and her children's education. She buys the corn to make her tortillas from a nearby shop, and she buys firewood from people who go around the town selling it from their pick-up. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 5 bags of corn for $40.00 each. Buying this a large amount at once means she can get it for a lower price, and avoid wasting time having to buy more corn every time. Being able to store the corn in her home also means that she can always be sure of having enough for her customers, since when there is a shortage of corn in the shops this creates delays in her business.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to save up so that her children can study to become professionals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1407412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy 5 bags of corn, worth $40.00 each.\r\n.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-11T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-10T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatr\u00edz Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":17.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":17.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":18.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":19.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":19.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":21.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":22.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":23.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.07,"local_amount":19.07,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":19.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090856},{"amount":180.93,"local_amount":180.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":180.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856853}],"funded_date":"2013-08-11T15:17:28Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":593999,"name":"Barrio Municipal Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cBARRIO MUNICIPAL\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el cuarto ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Collpani, est\u00e1 compuesta por nueve integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Micaela es la Presidenta.

Lahore, Pakistan. Her 4 sons are doing different jobs in different firms.\r\n\r\nHer husband makes saws at home and sells into the market. A saw is a hand tool with a toothed blade used to cut hard materials such as wood or bone. It is among the oldest known tools. Innovations made over thousands of years ago are still present in modern day. He has been making saws for many years and feeding his family.\r\n\r\nAs with the increase in the needs of his family, her husband wants to grow his business also. Therefore, Zarina asked for a loan of 35,000 PKR from Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband could grow his business.  She hopes that this loan will prove a productive and beneficial one for the business and for her family also.\r\n\r\nZarina is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC

He says this loan will help him increase his income base and thus be able to educate his children and also improve their standard of living.

Her primary activity is making buttons made from the ivory nut. She has a lathe for this purpose, a machine that will cut the ivory nut, and she uses it to make raw buttons. She then delivers these to wholesalers that come to her hometown to purchase them, then later take them to Manta where they will be sent abroad for finishing. She has seven years of experience in this line of work, and it provides her the means to send her children to school, which is the most important thing for her.\r\n\r\nKetty will use this loan to purchase ivory nut so she can make her buttons. She has been part of the communal bank from the start - in fact, she is the secretary - and she appreciates the help it gives. Her dream is to give her children the best."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1407439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"purchase ivory nut.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-08-11T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-10T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ketty Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400.87,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":116.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":116.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":116.74,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":118.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815899},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":233.48,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410966110},{"amount":356.26,"local_amount":350.22,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":356.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857846},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":233.48,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506215},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":233.48,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439729982},{"amount":237.49,"local_amount":233.47,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":237.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636110}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T03:40:53Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T11:24:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":594005,"name":"Rosa Del Pilar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Virgen Del Rosario se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en Colorado del Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

She spent 4 years at elementary school. Her husband also works on a rotating schedule as a security guard so their children help with the farming tasks when their parents can't be there. Some of the land that she owns she inherited from her parents and some of it was bought. \r\nCurrently, the additives that she uses to maintain her coffee crop are expensive and come with an additional transportation expense so she has requested a loan from the Comixmul cooperative to buy and transport agricultural supplies to boost her coffee crops. \r\nHer goal is to improve her crops by buying additives that will give them better foliage and better berries and protect them from vermin. This will help her because her crops will be strengthened and attractive to her customers and so she will generate greater income for her family and improve their living conditions by investing in her crops and working with honesty.

Due to unemployment and lack of work opportunities, his family has gone through very difficult financial times. But with an entrepreneurial attitude and dreams of moving ahead, he continued looking for options that would allow him to get ahead. Six months ago, an opportunity presented itself to rent some space that has synthetic soccer field turf, which he rents out by the hour. He also has a store next to the field where he sells cakes, hydrating drinks, sodas, and liquor. With this, he has generated income to continue supporting his household. The borrower is requesting the loan to purchase fixed assets (tables and chairs) and stock up on wholesale items (cakes, beer, sodas, hydrating drinks, and candies). With this he will be able to improve his business' image so his customers will be more comfortable and be able to enjoy the space, as well as so he can offer a better variety of products to satisfy the different tastes of the people who patronize his business. The will augment his sales, and, ultimately, his revenues.

For three years, she worked at a fast food business as an employee, but in light of her pregnancy being so high risk, she had to resign. Now she finds herself unemployed and, due to financial needs that her family has as well as the expenses that came along with her baby, she wants to start her own business and take advantage of the opportunity that presented itself to acquire a hot dog stand located at a well-known spot in the area where she lives. There, she will sell hamburgers, hot dogs, salchipapas (hot dogs and fries), meat kabobs, and other items. She will do this work thanks to the experience and know-how she gained at her last job. With this, she will be able to earn the income needed to support her household. \r\n\r\nLina is an enterprising, fighting, active, and sensible woman with hopes of getting ahead. She is requesting the loan to purchase the hot dog stand, tables, seats, and stock (cold meats, bread, potatoes, oil) with the goal of being able to start her work and get just a little closer to reaching her goals, which are to grow her business, become well known in the area, and survive the time to be able to generate good revenues and have financial stability that will allow her to have a better quality of life with her husband and baby."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1407770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
