education to impoverished women so that with their own efforts, the women can lift themselves, their families, and communities out of poverty. The ladies are organized into Trust Banks and meet with a Trust Bank Loan Officer from Friendship Bridge once a month. It is a win-win situation and there are numerous success stories.\r\n\r\nOne year ago, the Celestial Trust Bank, located in Pasach First Village in Cantel Quetzaltenango, received its first loan, funded by Kiva investors. The loans were of great value to the nine members and their businesses benefitted. Currently, the women are applying for an additional loan and are requesting the support of Kiva investors throughout the world who can help them with this request. The Trust Bank has grown to 14 members whose average age is 32 years. The women are engaged in various types of businesses including retail sales (items for daily consumption, bakery items, livestock, and meat) as well as embroidery and textile production.\r\n\r\nCristina is a 25-year-old married woman who is a new member of the Trust Bank. She has two young children and one is already attending primary school. Her other child is still too young. Cristina\u2019s husband is a hard-working mason who lacks work at the present time. Cristina began her business of selling pork one year ago. The business is doing quite well, but she would like to expand. She joined the Celestial Trust Bank in order to secure a loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to purchase four pigs to meet current demand. As the construction business is quite slow in the current economic climate in Guatemala, Christina holds the vision that her business will grow and she will become the main breadwinner of the family.\r\n\r\nThe Celestrial Trust Bank expresses gratitude to all Kiva investors. They are so pleased to be able to secure these loans, expand their businesses, and provide additional income for their families. They value the supportive relationships that they have with their fellow Trust Bank members. They all look forward to a brighter future, one in which they have the necessary tools for success!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":1403757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

She has been practicing animal husbandry since 2005. The business began with 6,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her incredibly hard and productive work Gulmira has achieved some successes in development of her business. She now earns a monthly profit of 6,000 som (KGS), and today owns three dairy cows, 15 sheep, and a horse. Her husband and children help with the business. Her husband also works as a shepherd. In order to further develop her business, Gulmira came to the microfinance group Bai Tushum and Partners for a 20,000 som (KGS) loan to buy sheep. She plans to use the profit from use of the loan to invest into further expanding her livestock herd.

city in Guatemala called Quetzaltenango, in the western highlands. The Trust Bank is composed of eight women who average 43 years of age. Each has an average of four children. These women work in various businesses like animal husbandry, production and sales of tiles, manufacture and sale of shoes, as well as textile sales.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Cecilia, better known as Do\u00f1a Ceci, who is a cheerful, enthusiastic and collaborative lady who is the secretary for the Lila Trust Bank. She enjoys this job very much. She has taken out several loans with Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\n Do\u00f1a Ceci is a 46-year-old married woman with ten children who range in age from 5 to 27. Five of the children are in school. Do\u00f1a Ceci is committed to seeing each of them complete their education and start their careers. With this goal in mind, she created a business from her first loan with Friendship Bridge and began raising animals such as chickens and ducks. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Do\u00f1a Ceci wants to add more animals to her business, so she is requesting a loan to purchase six turkeys, several chickens and two pigs. In addition, she has budgeted some funds from her loan to buy food for the animals in order to fatten them for market. Do\u00f1a Ceci\u2019s dream is to enlarge her business and have as many animals as possible. She is aware that some take a longer time to fatten and sell. In the future, she hopes to sell eggs as well.\r\n\r\nThe earnings that Do\u00f1a Ceci has generated have allowed her to move forward, and she feels empowered! In her own words: \u201cMy group and I appreciate the financial support through Friendship Bridge. It is incredible to know that people from around the world (Kiva investors) are helping us through the Internet.\u201d She giggles about the Internet and adds, \u201cI'm not sure how that works.\u201d She adds, \u201cGod bless them and all their generosity because it really is so important to us to have this opportunity.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":1403763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase turkeys, pigs and chickens.

","en":"Yusupjon lives in the J. Rumy district. He is 46 years old, married and has eight children. As the children grow, so do the family's expenses. Right now the family's only source of income is what the oldest son sends home from his work abroad. Those funds don't cover the family's expenses though. Yusupjon decided to start an income generating family business, and he chose animal husbandry. He intends to buy and sell cattle. His wife and children will help. Yusupjon knows how to raise livestock because they already have a family milk cow. Yusupjon's starting capital will be 125 USD, and they also have a 10x4 meter shed in the yard and 100 bundles of hay. With the goal of beginning the business, Yusupjon is asking for a loan to buy 4 bull calves and their feed. He wants to use the income earned to pay for his son's wedding.

He transports organic salt (made from Uvs lake in Uvs province) to Ulaanbatar, where he offers it for sale. He then brings a variety of goods for other local customers back to Uvs province. He is known as a hard-working, modest, and courteous person. \r\n\r\nSince both his daughters attend university, Nyamgalya needs to increase the family income so that he can cover their educational expenses. He is therefore requesting a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 MNT, which he will use to purchase a large amount of organic salt produced from Uvs lake, which he will transport to the capital city to offer for sale. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1404827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase a large amount of organic salt (produced from Uvs lake) to transport to the capital city to offer for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Uvs","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2013-08-11T23:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-10T23:50:01Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":75.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nyamgalya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":649.84,"local_amount":1000073.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-02T09:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1005480.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.21,"payment_id":399947716},{"amount":668.58,"local_amount":1000195.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1005602.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.55,"payment_id":410230754},{"amount":643.76,"local_amount":999772.43,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T22:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1005178.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":31.06,"payment_id":419994541},{"amount":662.24,"local_amount":999959.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1005365.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.76,"payment_id":429647098}],"funded_date":"2013-08-13T11:15:13Z","paid_date":"2013-12-18T00:48:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":592253,"name":"Carly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of seven children, three of whom are in school, Carly works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a food vending business in the Philippines and also earns additional income from farming vegetables.

","en":"Jose, 41 years old, is married and has three children. He works in the commercial sector, and he has had his own businesses such as a vegetable shop and a distillery. However, due to various external factors, he had to close them. Currently, he works as a public service taxi driver. He has to pay a percentage of the money he earns to the owner of the vehicle, which causes economic instability in his home. But Jose, with his enterprising attitude, drive, determination, and effort, took the initiative to sell Amway products to complement his income. He alternates this work as he works in the taxi, and a number of his passengers become potential customers of his products, increasing his sales and, in turn, his income. \r\n\r\nJose is requesting a loan to invest in buying wholesale merchandise (shampoo, dietary supplements, natural products, personal hygiene products) to take advantage of the discounts for buying in quantity and to have a variety of products to offer that satisfy his customers' needs and preferences. This will allow Jose to continue growing his business, working independently to have solvency in his household's economy.

After getting married at the age of 21, she decided to start her own business, in order to generate income and contribute to the household expenses. So she learned the art of dressmaking and with that knowledge opened her own shop in her home. Initially she sewed for third parties, but three years later started with her own line of articles for the home like sheets, bed clothing, quilts, towels, pillow-cases, etc. Doing this she was able to pay the household expenses and get her children ahead. Working independently she could be flexible and choose her own hours. \r\n\r\nCelina is an enterprising and active woman, dedicated to her family and to her work. For these reasons she is requesting this loan in order to buy supplies at wholesale prices (fabric, thread, needles and synthetic cotton) and pay off an existing loan. By doing this she can continue with her business, having the raw materials at hand to make her products. And offer a variety of colors and fabrics to her clients, increasing her sales and revenue. \r\n\r\nCelina dreams of expanding her business and offering employment to mothers who are also the head of their family.

She is currently separated.  Due to a lack of work opportunities and the financial difficulties she went through after her partner left her, Martha decided to start her own business to get the resources she needed on her own.  All of the financial responsibility fell to her, as the head of her household.  She opened a sales stall selling food, sodas and pastries in the neighborhood she lives in.  Since she started the business, it has been going well as there are a lot of people who pass through the area.  Martha has the help of one direct employee, which allows her to stay on top of her daughter's education.  Martha is an enterprising, sensible and active woman, and she is constantly looking for ways to get ahead.  That is why she is requesting a second loan cycle.  She plans to invest it in the purchase of fixed assets (a refrigerator\/freezer) and wholesale stock (pastries, cookies, candies, ice cream, sodas, beer) to offer a greater variety of products and a better service to her customers to satisfy their wants and needs.  Then she will be able to increase her clientele and consequently her income.  And she will be able to keep moving toward making her dream come true- to open a large and comfortable restaurant for her customers.  That would allow Martha to have a favorable financial stability and to give her daughter a better education and a better quality of life.

She now sews for other people and she also has her own line of household items, such as bedcovers and bath sets. She has the help of one employee and she works Monday through Saturday. Thinking of her son\u2019s future and with the desire to grow her business, Norma is requesting a second loan, to invest in a coverstitch sewing machine, which she needs in order to get more weekly contracts because the companies that she sews for are demanding new sewing batches. In this way, she could turn in the products on time and with high quality finishing so that she could increase her income and provide a good education to her son. Norma also dreams of growing her business, so that she could generate more job opportunities and improve her finances. Her goal is to save so she can buy her own house. This would notably improve her family\u2019s wellbeing and quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1407945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Actualmente se dedica a laborar como empleado en un cultivo de flores, actividad que alterna con la agricultura de manera independiente, pues posee cultivos de papa y fr\u00edjol y recibe el apoyo de su padre; los productos que cosechan son vendidos en la plaza de mercado del pueblo donde reside y es as\u00ed como ha logrado obtener recursos para aportar a la econom\u00eda de su hogar.

He is currently working as an employee, raising flowers, and also raises his own potatoes and beans and receives his father\u2019s support.  He sells his harvest in the plaza market where he lives and he has been able to obtain resources to support the finances in his home.  Carlos is a dynamic, active, enthusiastic young man with many plans.  He is always searching for opportunities that will allow him to get ahead, but he decided to ask for this loan so he can buy farming supplies in quantity (fertilizers, irrigation, fungicide) so he can take advantage of the discounts he gets for paying in cash, allowing him to continue caring for his crops and have a good quality harvest that he can sell at a better price.  This way he can increase his profit margin, continue supporting his household finances, and continue investing in his business.  He will be able to grow his business and have the chance to provide employment to other farm workers in his sector, so he can not only improve his own family\u2019s quality of life, but also others\u2019."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1407743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farming supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-12T03:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-11T03:40:01Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Mario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":65568},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":67366},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":69213},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":71111},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":73061},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":75064},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":77122},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":79237},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81410},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83642},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":85935},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":88292},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90713},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":93200},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":95756},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":98381},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":101079},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":103850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.26},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.06,"local_amount":65569,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T09:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":67513.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822357},{"amount":37.05,"local_amount":67339,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":69335.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807343},{"amount":37.99,"local_amount":69079,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":71127.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095435},{"amount":39.05,"local_amount":70999,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":73104.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074497},{"amount":40.17,"local_amount":73039,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":75204.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009690},{"amount":83.86,"local_amount":152480,"processed_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":157001.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523282},{"amount":550.82,"local_amount":1001495,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1031194.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227048}],"funded_date":"2013-08-27T11:59:53Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T09:57:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

He is the father of 3 children and is in a common-law marriage with his spouse. \r\n\r\nHis working life is spent as a construction worker, but seeing as that is a very unstable and uncertain field, he decided to start his own business, a fast food stall. This is an activity that he alternates with his work in construction.\r\n\r\n He initially started out selling products like hot dogs, hamburgers, and French fries, among others, from a street corner. As every day he had more customers, he decided to rent a small shop where his customers would be more comfortable. In this way, he has been able to obtain enough resources to get his family ahead.  \r\n\r\nGildardo is an enterprising, vigorous, and very hardworking man. His business opens from Wednesday to Sunday at 5 p.m., as this is when he finishes his daily work at his job. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting support from the loan in order to invest in the purchase of supplies (bread, potatoes, cold meat, soft drinks, sauces) and make improvements to his business, as it\u2019s somewhat deteriorated. This will help him to improve his business\u2019s image in order to attract more customers, and to have basic supplies available to fill demand and satisfy his guests\u2019 wishes. \r\n\r\nGildardo hopes to be able to save some money and purchase his building in order to improve his creditworthiness and offer better general welfare, education, and quality of life to his children and his spouse.

Monica plans to use the loan to cover the cost of her graduation fees. Often there are fees for earning your title in business before graduating. In addition to her responsibilities at school, Monica currently works 40 hours a week and earns $15 a day. With a degree in business, she expects to earn $25 a day. Unfortunately, Monica's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, her parents never had the chance to move up. Growing up, finances have always been tight. With two older siblings attending college already, Monica is unsure how she will be able to finance her education on her own without the assistance of a Vittana Loan.

To achieve his goal, Nelson has enrolled in the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Juan Misael Saracho. He plans to graduate in June 2014 but without a loan from Vittana, he fears that he will need to defer his graduation. Nelson plans to use his loan to buy his school books. Up until now, he has been managing to get by without them but it has become a challenge. With books and school supplies, he feels he will be able to get better grades. One of his biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. Unfortunately, Nelson's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, his parents never had the chance to move up. Growing up, finances have always been tight. Nelson currently works 25 hours a week as a security guard to help afford his school and living expenses.\r\n\r\nThis loan is administered by Vittana's partner

He sells his crops in the central bazaar to make profits, in order to support his family. Sirac\u2019s income from business is 130 AZN. In order to improve the living conditions of his family, he plans to expand his business. This will require a lot of dedication and effort. He believes that, in the near future, his sons will help him to grow the business. Since the vegetable and fruit business is profitable and fun, he wants the business to continue and prosper. He has applied to Aqroinvest for a loan of 2,000 AZN. This loan is for the purpose of buying new fertilizer and seeds. It will help him to grow more vegetables and fruits in order to obtain more revenue in the coming summer, which will help him to meet his family\u2019s needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1404896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She produces cheese products to sell at the local markets.  In addition, she has a plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of fruits and vegetables are grown.  As the existing income is not enough for her family, Marina decided to request a loan for a new business.  All of the financial institutions rejected her loan due to unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  \n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, Marina applied for credit to MFO Credo.  Her request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva.  This program permits the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  A loan of $5,000 will help Marina to purchase a minibus.  Once purchased, her son will be able to work on the minibus line and receive a stable income.

Gulnara is a teacher at the local public school.  Edvard is actively involved in agricultural activities.  In particular, he has a plot of agricultural land where nut trees and mandarin trees are grown.  He sells the harvested products at the local markets. \n\nAs the existing income is seasonal and not enough for a four-member family, Edvard decided to start his own business.  All of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Edvard applied for the credit to MFO Credo.  His request was approved in the framework of a Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva.  This program enables the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  \n\nA loan of $3,000 will help him to purchase a minibus.  Once the minibus is purchased, he will work on the minibus line and increase the family income.  With the increased income, he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family members.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1402101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

After completing high school, he started working as a construction assistant, but since he wanted to have a more stable income, he decided to start his own business; a grocery store where he sells groceries, cookies, cold cuts, and other things.  He learned this business from a friend and works Monday through Sunday in order to earn enough income for his family.  He has help from another person who works sporadically, especially on days when he has construction contracts.  John is a young, dynamic, vigorous, enterprising man whose main motivation is to get ahead with his parents.

Taking care of animals is a continuous effort, but his wife is helping him to raise the cattle, fatten them, and sell them in the market.\r\n\r\nIzzat usually buys cattle, takes care of them by fattening them, and finally sells them in the market. His monthly income is 150 AZN. This financial income is the only source for the family. He plans to expand the business in order to bring more funds into the family. Selling meat is a very profitable business in Azerbaijan due its common use in everyday meals. \r\n\r\nIzzat is applying for a loan of 2,000 AZN in order to buy more calves. This is going to be his fourth loan with Aqroinvest. He believes this loan will have a positive impact on the expansion of his

agriculture production located at the slopes of Mt. Kenya. She has four children, three of whom are of school going age. She has been practicing farming for twenty years. Her source of income is horticultural crops and milk.

Following  a very difficult emotional situation when her husband left her and having all the financial responsibilities fall on her, she looked for income opportunities to be able to pay her household expenses and has been selling pastries, sweets, cigarettes, and cell phone cards on foot for the past six years.  This has allowed her to provide her family with their basic needs.  She is a very enterprising, friendly, dynamic, and hard working woman who works long shifts Monday  through Sunday so she can take maximum advantage of her stall, since it\u2019s located on a well-travelled main street in the city where she lives.  She is asking for this seventh loan which she will use to fix up her stall, buy stock (pastries, cookies, candy, cigarettes) and pay off the other loan she has.  This will allow her to improve her business\u2019 image to the passersby and also to have enough inventory to satisfy her customers\u2019 desires.  This will increase her sales and income.

She has a higher education and works at a village office.  Her husband helps her with the business.  To provide additional income, Aygul has been involved in an agricultural business - animal husbandry and farming - for many years.  Thanks to Atyrkul's patience and hard work, today she has one dairy cow and twenty-five sheep on her farm.  She also has 1.72 hectares of irrigated land, where she annually plants potatoes, beans and perennial herbs.  Aygul receives an additional income of 4550 som (KGS) from selling milk.  In order to further develop her business, Aygul requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy two cows.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing livestock quantities and also intends to prepare a dowry for her

is 51 years old, married and has one son.  She has a higher education and works as a post office worker at a village office.  Her husband works at a construction company.  To provide additional income, Atyrkul has been involved in an agricultural business - animal husbandry and farming - for many years.  Thanks to Atyrkul's hard work, today she has three dairy cows, one calf and ten sheep on her farm.  She also has 2.58 hectares of irrigated land, where she annually plants peppers and beans.  Atyrkul receives an additional income of 5400 som (KGS) from selling milk.  In order to further develop her business, Atyrkul requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy two cows.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing livestock quantities and also intends to purchase a tractor for treating the land in the

The start-up loan program provides informal businesses that do not have access to credit products with start-up loans with soft conditions. This new initiative will significantly improve Gayane's teaching conditions, as she will be able to purchase technical supplies for kids (computer, clipboard).\r\n\r\nGayane will be very grateful to Kiva lenders for their support.

Today Maripa's farm contains one dairy cow and twenty sheep.  She also has 2.58 hectares of land for planting beans and potatoes.  Her husband and children help with the business.  In order to further develop her business, Maripa requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows.

There are also some tiny stores, food vendors and a business selling bubbles. The average age of this group of hard working women is 38 and they have had an average of four years of school. These women are excited to be part of this group since Namaste Guatemaya is the first organization to give them the opportunity to learn how to manage their business and their money in addition to offering microcredit.  \n\nIngrid Yolanda (third from right) is a 37-year-old widow with four children - 3 sons aged 18, 17 and 16 and a daughter aged 12.  Her husband died in an automobile accident when she was pregnant with her daughter.  Her business is selling small bottles of bubble-making solution with wands for blowing bubbles.  She mixes shampoo, a natural glue and water, and bottles it in small bottles.  She also makes the wands out of wire.  She sells these at fairs and fiestas throughout her part of the country.  Bubbles are popular at Guatemalan fairs.  She started this business when she was seven, to bring additional income to her parents.  She continued the business when she was married and now she supports herself and her children with a little help from her oldest son who works as a construction helper.  Her other children help her in her business.  Only her youngest child is still in school.\n\nHer monthly income is 2000 Quetzales (US $256) with a profit of Q1200 (US $153).  With her loan she plans to travel to Guatemala City to buy solutions, bottles and wire in bulk.  Her projected profit with her new business plan and buying in bulk is Q1876 (US $240) which is an increase of 56% and will allow her to better feed her family and perhaps allow one or two of the boys to return to school. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1407247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy in bulk the supplies she needs for her business selling bubbles at fairs and fiestas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Miguel Due\u00f1as, Sacatep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-08-12T23:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-11T23:20:01Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria De La Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Nohemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lesbia Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":11100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1233.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":319.04,"local_amount":2485.16,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410095147},{"amount":158.72,"local_amount":1236.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419860866},{"amount":159.58,"local_amount":1243.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1252.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509403},{"amount":136.98,"local_amount":1067.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1075.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733255},{"amount":182.59,"local_amount":1422.27,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1433.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449639176},{"amount":152.29,"local_amount":1186.28,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459105530},{"amount":158.45,"local_amount":1234.27,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467920406},{"amount":157.35,"local_amount":1225.66,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1235.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479141177}],"funded_date":"2013-08-31T19:05:46Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:29:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":594424,"name":"Elwin Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elwin, est\u00e1 casado vive con su esposa y su hija.

Previously she sold juices, and later decided to make lunches, at the request of her clientele. \r\n \r\nThe loan that she is taking out will increase her capital (to purchase rice, potatoes and chicken) that she acquires in the markets in El Alto and later to make and sell the food from her sales stall.  This type of work allows her to generate income for her family, as she is married and has two children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Se\u00f1ora Rosmery says that she likes the orientations from the loan counselors.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1408424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, potatoes and chicken.

Omar spends the whole day at his work but unfortunately only makes around $350 USD a month and that only if he manages to sell everything. Because he has low income informal job, he does not have access to credit from other organizations. \n\nOmar is requesting this loan to finish paying for the materials he needs to build a proper roof and room for his girls.

Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Karina.'\r\n\r\nPeninah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied \"because of farming.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"Saving culture.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.
