She is from Buchanan, which is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea.  It is well-known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city speak Bassa, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.  Unfortunately, Janet was not able to attend school. She is married with six children between the ages of four and 23. Three of her children live at home and attend school. Janet describes herself as a hardworking woman.  For the past seven years, she has run a shop where she sells fashionable clothes. She started her business with money from her mother and transports her goods by taxi. Janet works five hours a day seven days a week and her major business challenge is to increase her sales. \r\n\r\nJanet is requesting a loan to buy fashion clothes to sell.  She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. In the future, Janet plans to educate all her children.

is Ibrahim from Waterloo, an eastern area in Freetown, He is in his late forties. He is married with two children, ages 14 years and 19 years. He began this business because he lost his parent and he could not go to school, so this business is his profession.  \r\n\r\nIbrahim runs a general store; he sells drinks, cigarettes, biscuits, and soap. He has been running this business for over 20 years. He works at the business every day, 12 hours per day.

He is married with two children who are 1 and 4. In 2009, Sheriff established his clothing business. He began his business because he wanted to create his own permanent source of income. Before then, Sheriff was a shopkeeper. He works seven days a week from eight in the morning through seven at night.

She lives with her common law partner. For the past 13 years she has run a business, that her father-in-law left her as an inheritance, a bar that offers soft drinks, beer, coffee, pastries and other products. The business has been in existence for 50 years, so it is well known in the area it is located in. \r\n\r\nOlga learned this business by working in it and with the help of her husband and an employee has been able to maintain it. But due to financial difficulties she has not been able to invest money to make the business grow, since up to now she has only made enough to support her household. So she is requesting this loan to expand and fix-up the business and to buy stock (soft drinks, coffee, beer, pastries).

All of the children live with their mother.  After the death of her husband, the family's provider, Sozul became involved in farming and animal husbandry in 1986 in order to find income for her family.  She started the business with 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard labor and diligent work, Sozul achieved some successes in developing her business and started to earn a monthly profit in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS).  Today Sozul's farm contains three dairy cows, one calf, one horse and fifty sheep.  Her family is very friendly, and all of the children help the mother with the business.  In order to further develop her business, Sozul requested a loan in the amount of 75,000 som (KGS) from \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy purebred livestock.  Sozul hopes that she will earn a good income from purebred livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further growing her small business and also plans to buy a car for her son in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1405521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy purebred livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Avletim village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-13T20:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-12T20:10:07Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sozul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":620},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":930}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":620,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":30353.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942550},{"amount":930,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":45530.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462749}],"funded_date":"2013-08-23T15:23:41Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":594895,"name":"F\u00e1tima Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"F\u00e1tima es una se\u00f1ora, ejemplar,  por vocaci\u00f3n eligi\u00f3 la profesi\u00f3n  del  Magisterio, ya que el anhelo m\u00e1s grande,  es relacionarse con los ni\u00f1os.\nEsta  se\u00f1ora trabaja en un instituto de la localidad donde vive, desempe\u00f1\u00e1ndose como maestra de Educaci\u00f3n secundaria con 3 a\u00f1os de ejercer dicha actividad, madre soltera con un hijo a su cargo.\n\n Actualmente  est\u00e1  presentando una necesidad de mejorar su vivienda y por eso se presento a las oficinas de ceprodel para solicitar un peque\u00f1o financiamiento para la compra de materiales de construcci\u00f3n tales como zinc, ladrillo, cemento.

","en":"Zarakhan is 54 years old, married, and has two children (one son and one daughter). Zarakhan has secondary education. As a person she is hard working, and has an optimistic view on life. \r\n\r\nAs a main income for her family, Zarakhan has been working with selling men's and women's clothing since 1995, after having started this business with 3,000 som (KGS). She has a rented retail space at the central market. Her husband helps with the business. He brings goods from wholesale markets, while Zarakhan sells them as retail goods. \r\n\r\nThanks to Zarakhan and her husband's persistent and coordinated work, they have been able to develop and broaden their assortment of goods. Zarakhan's business brings in around 10,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as the basis to cover the family's food expenses and household needs. The income from the business allowed Zarakhan to increase her turnover. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zarakhan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase men's and women's clothing for reselling. The income from the loan will help Zarakhan increase her turnover and the income received also helps her pay for her son's tuition for education under good conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1405679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Raikhan has a higher education and is well respected by her neighbors.  They say that she is a kind and hardworking woman.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, Raikhan has been involved in selling food products since 2004, having started this business with 20,000 som (KGS).  She leases her store and sells food products there.  Thanks to her hard work, Raikhan was able to grow her business and expand the merchandise selection.  Her business yields about 40,000 som (KGS) per month, serving as a base for covering family expenses for food and needs.  The income from the business allowed Raikhan to increase her product turnover.  In order to further develop her business, Raikhan requested a loan in the amount of 122,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy food products wholesale for future resale.  The earnings from the loan will help Raikhan to increase product turnover at the food market, and the resulting profit will help her to raise and educate her children in good conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1405532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Village of Kaduna.  He is excited about the opportunities Babban Gona provides him to grow his farm and looks forward to when his family members are all so happy to have enough healthy food to eat, with the support provided by Babban Gona.  Like all Babban Gona members, Ishaku has the opportunity to double his income and yield this season; he can expect to earn $1,350\/ha, twice the average Nigerian farmer's yearly income.  With this increase in earnings, he hopes to continue using his profits to reach greater heights for himself and his family.  With this loan, he is on his way to achieving these dreams.  His most recent loan from Babban Gona provided him with enough fertilizer to optimize his yields and access to a product that eliminates a food toxin in his maize, enabling his family to eat healthier maize and for him to get a premium price for the maize he sells.

Chynara has secondary education. As a person, she is quiet and hard working. Chynara has long experience with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. In this regard, she has worked with fattening cattle since year 2000. She started this business with 4,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to Chynara's persistent work, she currently has three dairy cows and eight sheep on her farm. Her business brings in around 5,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as a basis for covering the family's food expenses and household needs. The income from the business allowed Chynara to increase the number of livestock at the farm. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Chynara turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) for the purchase cows. Chynara plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her farm.

Her daughter is a student, one son works in Russia, and the other son is a school student.  Elmira has a secondary-specialized education.  She is calm, responsible, happy and hardworking.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, Elmira has been involved in an agricultural business - fattening up livestock and growing agricultural crops - since 1987.  She grows strawberries.  She started this business with 800 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, Elmira's business contains two dairy cows, one bull, three sheep, and also has a land plot of 1.16 hectares, where she grows sainfoin and wheat.  Her business yields about 8,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk, strawberries, which serves as a base for covering her family's expenses for food and needs.  Money transfers from Russia, where Elmira's son works, comprise additional income.  The income from the business allowed Elmira to educate her daughter at a university.  In order to further develop her business, Elmira requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls for subsequent fattening up and resale.  The earnings from the loan will help Elmira to grow her business and also to update furniture at home in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":1405546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bulls for subsequent fattening up and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Suu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-13T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-12T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":117.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":65000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1337.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1337.5,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":65480.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462751},{"amount":384.77,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":20147.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.77,"payment_id":561577984},{"amount":834.85,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":45332.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":91.11,"payment_id":664995278}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T23:21:13Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":593524,"name":"Ishaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ishaya is a devoted father, a maize farmer and a Babban Gona member in the Tsirya Village of Kaduna.

Presently he needs additional capital for the growth of his business. So Tahira, as a member of a two person lending group, has requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of clothes to sell, so he can respond quickly to customer needs. \r\n\r\nWith the help of profit, he will put aside some savings to pay the electricity and gas bills. Tahira hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

She has a secondary education.  She has been involved in an agricultural business - animal husbandry and farming - since 2007, having started this business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Her youngest son helps her with the business.  Thanks to Darikha's hard work, today she has a good buisness, containing one dairy cow, two calves, eighteen sheep and elevel goats.  She also has a land plot of 1.40 hectares, where she grows hay and feed for the livestock.  The profits allowed Darikha to increase livestock on her farm and, thus, improve her family's welfare.  In order to further develop her business, Darikha requested a loan in the amount of 75,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy livestock for subsequent fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan in further increasing the livestock quantities and also plans to marry off her youngest son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1405563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock for subsequent fattening up and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tendik village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-13T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-12T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":85.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darikha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":516.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":25294.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462752},{"amount":483.04,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25294.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.62,"payment_id":579488603},{"amount":464.54,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25294.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":52.13,"payment_id":595435843}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T20:04:11Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":592752,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a general store business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 25000 through NWTF to buy items to sell like soap, milk, sugar, canned goods, eggs, noodles, etc. for her general store business.\r\n\r\nSusan has been in this business for 6 years.

Guljamal became involved in selling children's clothing in 1998, having started with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  Guljamal was able to grow her business to have a monthly income of about 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to expand her merchandise selection, especially for the upcoming school season, Guljamal requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy school children's clothing.

She is living with her partner, Sonny, who works as a seaman. She and her children manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices, and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 8,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nNida hopes that her business will be successful, and dreams that her family will always be in good condition.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1405613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-08-14T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-13T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2898.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784524},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2318.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771510},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2318.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824552},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1159.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478383}],"funded_date":"2013-08-14T02:52:35Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:50:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":592796,"name":"Maricel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of six children, Maricel works hard to support her family.

He will use his loan to purchase pigs to start an animal husbandry business. He will put the pigs in a shed in the yard and raise and sell them for a higher price. Ivane's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country vulnerable poor who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income.

Due to a lack of employment opportunities and the difficult economic situation the family was in, she decided to look for ways to generate her own income.  A year and a half ago she started her own business and set up a store at home.  She sells family basket items such as cookies, eggs, coffee, sugar, bread, etc.  The work has given her enough money to support her husband in taking care of household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the business is that the store is located in a residential area where the purchase of daily consumption items is very common.  Ana is requesting a loan to buy a variety of wholesale products (coffee, pasta, grains, sugar, sauces, cookies, personal care and others).  She also wants to renovate the store (painting and electrical wiring) to give it a better appearance and offer more product variety to satisfy customer preference and needs.  This will help increase sales income.  \r\n\r\nAna wants to grow her business and keep it well-stocked so that in the medium term she can turn it into a well-known supermarket.  This will give her more economic stability to improve the family's living

He purchases a variety of unstitched clothes, stitches them, and sells them in the main market. Currently, he needs funds to purchase clothing to continue his work. However, he does not have enough savings to purchase material for his business, and, because of this, he remains worried.\r\n<p>\r\nNajma does not like to see her husband worried, and she wants to help him. Therefore, she is requesting a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of clothes to sell. This loan will not only help him to continue his business, but it will also help him to increase his net income and savings as well. With the help of profits, Najma will purchase a washing machine for her personal use.

She works by herself, but sometimes her sister helps her out. Magdalena is very talented. She writes poems and songs, and composes scripts for her performances. She is also a book author. It was difficult for Magdalena to get started. But thanks to her resilience she was able to promote herself. Magdalena has saved 5000 hriven to buy musical instruments (traditional Ukrainian flutes, psalteries, maracas, etc.), and children's toys. To perform her concerts she needs more materials and instruments; the more varied the concerts, the more often she will be invited to perform. WIth time, she hopes to perform abroad. Magdalena has long dreamed of investing her earnings into recording CDs with her songs; this is something she has wanted to do for several years."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1407011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical

He wants to welcome the new year with his family in a new comfortable and warm house full of joy and happiness. \r\n\r\nMore importantly, the new house will stop losing its heat and preserve energy and enable the family to burn less coal for heating, thus releasing less pollutants into air, contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

This is 32-year-old Maffenda from Tombo in the western rural area in Freetown. She is married and blessed with four children between the ages 4 years and 15 years.  \r\n\r\nMaffenda runs a cookery business at home; she sells cooked food at her house. She has been running this business since 2009. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Maffenda says that the main challenge to her business is that sometimes sales are very slow. \r\n\r\nMaffenda has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items like rice, palm oil and cooking seasonings. The extra income from this loan will allow her to take care of her children's welfare and increase her business. In the future, she plans to open a restaurant. She thanks you for your

She will buy noodles, rice and oil at nearby street markets and after manufacturing will sell in her sales space.  This way of working allows her to support her home as best possible because she\u2019s single and has two children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the training, the loans and the health services.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1408445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy noodles, rice and oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-08-14T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-13T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eddy\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Irene\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gelcina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1825.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1996.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2051.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2105.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2164.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2356.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":299.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":307.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":344.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":266.49,"local_amount":1825.3,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1841.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197898},{"amount":591.04,"local_amount":4048.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4083.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153645},{"amount":307.45,"local_amount":2105.84,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615218},{"amount":315.99,"local_amount":2164.36,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2183.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736157},{"amount":344.03,"local_amount":2356.34,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2377.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641674}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T14:22:39Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T11:29:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":594444,"name":"Teofila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teofila de 56 a\u00f1os es una mujer casada, tiene 7 hijos pero solo vive con tres de ellos en su casa propia.

They all live in the same village of Temou, in the region of Segou (the fourth largest administrative region in Mali). They met through their winter agricultural activities, neighborhood ties, marriage, and kinship in the village. They are in the business of cultivating groundnuts, millet, and rice. In order to buy small equipment, stock up on agricultural inputs, and pay labor for weeding fields, the members of this group contacted Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first loan.  Ms. Hawa, the second woman at the right of the photo, plans to use her loan to buy seeds and agricultural inputs in Markala and Segou, small equipment from local blacksmiths, and to pay youth to weed her field.  The sale of her agricultural products is made in cash at the end of the rainy season to pay her loan and in order to have income to take care of her children as well as part of the needs of the family.

The house the family lives in has been deteriorating over the years and it needs some serious repair. So she is requesting a loan of 7000000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, fiberglass, cements, foam and planks. Using those materials, She and her sons can repair and insulate their house, thereby creating a comfortable and warm place to live. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal and release less pollutants therefore contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

She needed to make money to help support her family, so she started this venture after some training in running a business. She works ten hours a day, seven days a week. She says that her main challenge is the lack of enough money to run her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAdama is applying for a 500,000 SLL loan through BRAC Sierra Leone in order to buy extra palm oil to sell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to grow her business and improve her living standards. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Adama plans to continue expanding her business.
