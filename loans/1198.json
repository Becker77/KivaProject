Isatu started a business after her wedding, when she began selling groundnuts (peanuts) alongside the village road. She began her business, because she wanted to create a source of income to take care of her needs.  She says that the main challenge to her business is her lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan, in order to buy more bags of groundnuts to resell at the roadside. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business, and improve her standard of living. In the future, Isatu plans to expand the business even more.

five-year-old son.  He makes a living selling bananas and farming.  His principal crop is corn, which he has been growing for seven years.  When the harvest is ready, he stores the corn in sacks, as shown in the photo.

meet Victoria, aged 48, from St. Paul in Liberia. St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for its fish, due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past Freeport.  It is one of the poorer areas, and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. Victoria completed 9th grade, and she is married.   She has seven children between the ages of 9 and 33 years.  Only five of her children are in school, and they all live at home.\r\n \r\nVictoria has owned a table business for the past four years, selling foods including chickens' feet and pigs' feet.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more of these foods to sell.\r\n  \r\nOn average, she works 9 hours per day at her business.  She started her business with money she got from her husband. She transports her goods by taxi.  She cites as her biggest business challenge, \"too few goods.\"  Her favorite part of her business is the profit.  In the future, she would like to build a shop. She thanks you, in advance, for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1405805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Using her previous loan, she purchased a new automobile for her husband as the old one had become obsolete.

She had completed fifth grade before starting her business. She describes herself as a working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in St. Paul. St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for its fish, due to its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Freeport. It is one of the poorer areas, and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nPatience has a cook shop (restaurant) which has been selling rice and soup for the past three years now. She works ten hours at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is that sometimes customers complain about the high price of food. \r\n\r\nShe intends to use the loan to buy more food ingredients, such as dried bush-meat, fish, pepper, onions, Vita (juice drink), salt, etc. She started her business by selling for her mother. She likes her business because she makes more profit. She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

He lives in the village of Naghobilevi, West Georgia, with his wife, two children and parents. Several times, he has asked for loans from local financial institutions to start up a new business, without success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and lack of experience in his job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. The income source for the family is the agricultural business run by Dato. He owns a citrus garden, grows kiwi fruits, nuts and maize, and sells the harvest at the local market. Besides that, the family breeds two calves and takes good care of them. Dato\u2019s father is a truck driver and gets a transportation service fee per month.\r\n\r\nDato has requested a loan from Credo to start trading in fruit and vegetables. His loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions to the vulnerable poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Dato will purchase fruits and vegetables in East Georgia, where prices are low, and sell the products in his district with a price mark-up. He will use his own van to make deliveries. Dato plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually. With this loan, the family will generate enough income to access regularly available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event they need it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1405852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start trading in fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Naghobilevi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-15T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-14T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dato","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":165.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":169.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":179.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":93.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.24},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.6,"local_amount":232.87,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":238.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134317},{"amount":102.32,"local_amount":165.92,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":170.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107898},{"amount":104.57,"local_amount":169.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":173.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255432},{"amount":108.17,"local_amount":175.41,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":179.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019562},{"amount":466.34,"local_amount":756.22,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":775.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670669}],"funded_date":"2013-09-12T01:42:06Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:10:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":593012,"name":"Irma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irma is a 45-year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband and two children.

She is on her third individual loan with which she is planning to buy 15 \"pagnes wax\", 10 pairs of shoes of varying quality, five sets of embroidered fabric and brooms. She buys her goods locally and in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso) before reselling them door-to-door on a retail basis, for cash and on credit, to a customer base made up principally of women. The previous loans she has had have been fully repaid.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan she is expecting to make a monthly profit of 90,000FCFA, which will be used to increase her business, contribute to the family expenses and repay the interest on her loan.

","en":"Zuhro is 50 years old. She is married and has 4 children in her care. For over 17 years, she has worked as a controller in a government office. She likes her job and conscientiously performs her duties.\r\n\r\nZuhro and her husband can barely make ends meet due to their small salaries.

He lives with his wife and their children in a large traditional family in Hamdallaye, one of the popular districts of Sikasso town (third administrative region of the republic of Mali). Having had several failed businesses, he started buying and selling charcoal and firewood about 4 years ago. He gets his supplies from the surrounding villages and has his own tractor with which to transport them. He is much in demand by his customers because of the quality of his products. He decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution about 2 years ago in order to be able to better satisfy his growing client\u00e8le and is on his 6th individual loan. The 5 previous loans have been correctly repaid. He plans to use this 6th loan to buy 10 loads of firewood and some spare parts for his tractor, and to pay for maintenance on it. Thanks to this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 200 000 francs which he will use to build up his working capital, contribute to the family expenses and repay the interest on his loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1408849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy 10 loads of firewood, tractor spare parts and maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-08-15T09:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-14T09:30:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Siaka ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":126304.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972299},{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":126304.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740553},{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":126304.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263040},{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:58:24Z","rounded_local_amount":126304.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676385}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T20:26:21Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T16:58:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":593022,"name":"Taghrid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taghrid is a 23-year-old Lebanese single woman.

He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products.

Currently Erik's car is out of order and needs to be renovated. Erik requested a loan from local financial institutions several times, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because his business isn't registered as a formal business. Erik has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nThe loan is very important for Erik to

She completed grade 7 before establishing her business twelve years ago selling fish, chicken feet, pig feet, palm nuts, etc in the local market. She started this business with a little amount of help from her mother, and she learned this business from her sister. She is happy with the business.  She earns more money to help her fiancee with the children's schooling, and she also enjoys the interaction with her customers. She spends 8 hours at her business six days a week.  She is requesting a loan to purchase more fish, chicken feet, pig feet; palm nuts, etc for her business. Her prayer is to become an owner of houses. She hopes the supporters of BRAC Liberia will keep helping

She describes herself as a hardworking woman.\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, the capital City of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, cassava based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia. \r\nOretha has a stable business where she sells freezer fish, chicken and pig feet for the past three years.  She works from 8am to 4pm everyday at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is less income. She intends to use the loan to buy more freezer fish, chicken and pig feet. She started her business by selling for her mother. She likes her business because it helps to support her home. She hopes to one day own a house. She wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for their help.

Before this business, he had worked as distribution manager at an ice cream factory. Currently his wife is unemployed and stays at home looking after the children. \r\n\r\nThe house Gankhuyag built two years ago is losing its heat through door parts, so he is planning to make an extension to the house by building a barn. For this, he is requesting a loan of 3,500,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, bricks and cement. By doing so, he will effectively stop the heat loss from the house. As a result, his family will reduce its coal consumption, release fewer pollutants and contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nJenalyn hopes that her variety store will be a grocery store and dreams that her children will finish their studies.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

called Ty\u2019s Spices, Smoked Meats & Catering.  He is a popular chef who often caters special events and recently has seen an increase in business since his return from culinary training in Italy.\r\n\r\nHis original and zesty mixes are low in salt, his plum and lemon flavors have zero salt, and all spice mixes are free of MSG, gluten, preservatives, additives and dyes.  In addition to offering these seasonings for sale, he uses them to liven up his catered offerings of baked, grilled, saut\u00e9ed and smoked meats, as well as stir-fried and steamed vegetables.  \r\n\r\nLawrence\u2019s main goal is to create seasonings that are both delicious and healthful, offering everybody tasty options \u2013 even people who must follow restricted diets.  \r\n\r\nSince 2000, Lawrence has sold his products at Williams-Sonoma in Sugar Land, Texas, where he resides, and he regularly sells at the Farmer\u2019s Market at Imperial, also in Sugar Land.  His next goal is to attract the interest of a major grocery chain.  In order to reach that goal, he needed financial assistance to purchase more ingredients to produce more inventory.  His Accion Texas loan enabled him to do this and now he is seeking a major contract.  He says that by partnering with a major chain, he could increase his business by as much as 30 percent.\r\n\r\nDiscover more on his Facebook page: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tysspice\/photos#!\/tysspice\/ or his website at: http:\/\/tysspice.com.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1406129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more ingredients to produce more inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Sugar Land, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-08-15T14:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-14T14:00:28Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lawrence ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":593266,"name":"Katsaka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Katsaka is widowed and blessed with five children and only one attends school.

She is the featured borrower member for Gamthum Group. At 30 years old, Lhingneikim is married with six kids and lives in a village with her husband. The rest of the group members also live in the same village close to one another. The village is about 40 km away from the city capital of Imphal, which is also one of the state capitals for the north-eastern states of India. Her husband and she work side by side to meet the needs of the family. Her husband rears cattle, feeds them, and does businesses to generate income. She grows vegetables on the hill-slopes in the village and sells them to women selling vegetables at the town market. \r\n\r\nLhingneikim is a farmer who supplements the family income by selling vegetables, grown by her on the distant hill-slopes in the village. She grows beans, cabbage, cauliflower, ladyfingers, pumpkins, yams, chives, potatoes, and spring onions. She also grows local vegetables found only in the states and eaten only by the local people. Although her main business is growing vegetables and supplying vegetables to the women vendors, most of the time she is busy raising cows. She feeds them, cut their fodder, bathes them, vaccinates them, and milks them. The investment in raising cattle is more profitable than selling vegetables, shares Lhingneikim. Therefore, she decided to spend more time raising cattle in addition to growing vegetables. She will be engaged in both activities now.\r\n\r\nShe wants loan from Kiva to purchase a calf and raise it. Luck favors them both, Lhingneikim and her husband, when raising cattle. The cattle are taken to the nearby field to eat grass and, when they are fully grown, they are sold in the village as well as in the neighbouring villages. She also sells the milk and generates income. \r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS for the support and will remain obliged for the kind gesture. She will also repay the loan on time and try hard to be financially independent. Last but not least, she says, \u201cThank you, Kiva\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in piggery, weaving, and selling

For this reason, Iamze decided to ask for this loan. Iamze's loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans with reasonable terms to start-up businesses. These loans are provided to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low incomes. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase a milk cow. Iamze will place the cow in the cattle shed located in her yard and with the milk she will produce cheese which will be sold at the local market. She estimates that her income will increase by 150 to 200 GEL, which is a great support for a solitary pensioner. \r\nIamze awaits Kiva lenders'

While he is an experienced farmer, he also runs a grocery shop and has been looking for new business opportunities. He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine so that he can provide a milling service to over 300 households in his community.\n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (white corn) and creates a maize flour which is used to make the staple food in Zambia. Most families in Chrispin\u2019s community grow maize on their small farm, drying and storing it to be used as their source of food throughout the year. After the maize kernels are removed from the cob, they have to be milled to create flour. The flour is then boiled in water to make what is locally called Nshima.\n\nRent-to-Own has worked with Chrispin to thoroughly understand the market potential for a maize milling service in his community. Chrispin\u2019s proposed location for the maize mill is ideal, as the closest competitor is 14km away, and since most members of the community, and others that are nearby, walk or take their maize to the mill by bicycle, it is certain they will prefer to use Chrispin\u2019s mill rather than traveling a longer distance.\n\nEquipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost, not only for rural business owners such as Chrispin, but also for the community as a whole. Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill can be very prohibitive. Once Chrispin secures a loan he will be able to get a maize mill from Rent-to-Own. Rent-to-Own will deliver the mill to his place of business, install it, and provide training on how to use and maintain it. With a maize mill, Chrispin will be able to diversify his business and better serve his community.\n\nThis loan will help Chrispin establish a profitable service in his community that will support his family and the members of his community throughout the year. It is for this reason Chrispin is asking Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure a maize mill as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":1410648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She has three children, whom she raised and educated. For more than 25 years, Manzura has been engaged in producing flatbreads for subsequent sale. After she got married, she needed to help her husband to earn money. As we all know, the 90s were a very complex time and it was impossible to survive on her husband's small income. \r\n\r\nIn Manzura's words, that time began a streak in her life -- her husband was seriously ill. In parallel, she was working in bakery shops while nursing her husband and raising the children. After a long period of illness, Manzura's husband passed away. Manzura had to work around the clock without food and without sleep because she had debts to suppliers for flour and pressing needs. But a mother's love for her children gave her extra strength. Her work has not gone in vain; she was able to collect savings, pay off debts, and offer her two daughters in marriage. \r\n\r\nNow the time has come to think about putting on a wedding for her son.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to expand her business and working capital, so she is requesting a loan of 12,000 somoni to buy flour for working capital. She is applying for a loan for the first time and plans to repay it with the proceeds from the bakery shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1407076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

In particular, they cultivate land where maize is grown. Beka also produces hay which is used for feeding his livestock: a cow and a pig.  Beka works hard all day long and wishes to get ahead.\r\nSeveral times, he has requested loans from local financial institutions in order to start up trading business, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected because of lack of experience in the business, which is usually demanded by local financial institutions. His loan request has now been approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit, with soft conditions to country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high-risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\nWith the received credit, Beka plans to purchase clothing and household items from wholesalers in the capital city open market and then sell these items from his house. After investing the funds in his business, Beka hopes to generate additional revenue and invest the profits to further develop his business. Beka\u2019s grandmother will assist him for running the business.

Since 1997, she has been involved in agriculture - raising animals and crops - starting with a sum of 15,000 som KGS. Jyparkul's husband helps her around the farm. \r\n\r\nThanks to the hard work and patient nature of Jyparkul, she today has a good farm: three dairy cows and ten sheep. She also has available 3.0 hectares of irrigated land, on which she grows beans annually. Profits allowed Jyparkul to propagate livestock on her homestead and thus to improve the family's well-being. In order to further develop her homestead, Jyparkul turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nJyparkul plans to invest income from the loan to further increase the number of livestock, and also intends to do repairs on the home in which she lives with her

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', James replied 'Will be able to take children to school from my income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. James owns the following: 'cow, poultry, pump, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'solar power, TV, DVD' but does not have 'mosquito net, electricity, running water, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

A recent loan by Babban Gona provided him with enough fertilizer to boost the yield from his maize farm and a product called Aflasafe to remove toxins from his maize.  This season, he can earn up to $1,350\/ha, or twice the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s income.  With the opportunities provided by Babban Gona, Maje plans to expand his farming business in order to provide a better life for his family.

She has a college degree and works as an accountant in telecommunications.  By character, Burulkan is calm, balanced, and hard-working.  Her spouse and children help her with her business.  As a source of extra income for the family, for many years Burulkan has worked with livestock.  She started the business with 15,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work and care, today she has one dairy cow and 15 sheep.  She also has a plot of land where she grows clover, beans and corn.  This business brings in around 9,000 KGS a month from the sale of milk and dairy products, as well as vegetables which cover most of the family's food costs.  This income allowed Burulkan to give her children a good education.

It became very difficult for her to cope with her family's expenses as her husband left them nothing.  She is the main breadwinner for her family which includes her three children.  She is the light in the lives of her kids and their only hope.  Twenty years ago, she started her own business selling women's and men's footwear at a local market.  She has her own space where she sells her goods.  She mostly sells to women since the demand is higher than it is for men's and children's shoes. She needs to update her selection for the new season to attract more clients since she needs to earn more money for her orphaned children.  She's asking for a loan of 2,000 KGS to buy the new season's styles.  She awaits your kindness and relies on your mercy.

Her spouse works as a taxi driver in their village.  She herself is a homemaker.  However, lifestock is their main source of income.  Since 2002, they have worked with animals, having started the business with 10,000 KGS.  Suyunduk is hardworking and friendly.  Today she has one dairy cow, two bulls and one horse.  Her business brings in around 12,000 KGS a month from the sale of milk and, with the income from her husband, it covers most of the family's food costs.  With the goal of further expanding their farming efforts, Suyunduk turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 KGS to buy a bull.  She plans to us the income from the loan to further invest in the farm and also, in the future, to provide her children with a worthy education.

Her dream is to one day build her house so she can give a roof to her children and their family in general in her own way."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1410327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to buy products to stock her grocery store business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-15T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-14T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fany Xiomara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.96,"local_amount":1119.26,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1141.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070237},{"amount":55.64,"local_amount":1112.86,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1134.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833677},{"amount":46.9,"local_amount":938.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":956.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710482},{"amount":64.51,"local_amount":1290.23,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082555},{"amount":443.66,"local_amount":8872.87,"processed_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":9045.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530535545},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":6666.68,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":6796.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542499086}],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T18:41:19Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Gulvin","image":null}},{"id":593378,"name":"Enhsaihan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Enhsaihan is 25 years old and lives with her brother and parents in the Bayanzurh district of Ulaanbaatar.

Ines resides in the town of Puerto Colombia in the Department of Atl\u00e1ntico, which is 13 kilometers from the city of Barranquilla and considered to be part of its metropolitan area.  The Caribbean Sea is located to the north, so the primary industry in the area is tourism.  \r\n<p>\r\nInes has a business of selling imported clothing from the United States, which she offers on credit.  She started in this line of work three years when one of her sisters-in-law, who travels frequently to the United States, suggested that she sell imported American clothing.  Ines agreed and now, thanks to God, her business has been well-received.  She buys the clothes from her sister-in-law with cash and then sells them on credit to her customers, most of whom are her friends.  The rest are people who have been referred to her.  \r\n<p>\r\nInes operates her business every day from 8:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M.  This is her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy blouses, skirts, dresses, shirts, and trousers imported from the United States.

Five years ago, Cielo decided to become independent and establish her own business of making all types of knitted and embroidered garments.

She will invest in repairs to her knitting machine and the purchase of a necessary spare part so that she can continue her business.  Cielo and her business are dependent on that machine since she must have a source of income to cover necessities and family expenses.
