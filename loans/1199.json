Over these years of hard and tireless work, he has already formed a group of loyal customers. \r\n\r\nFor purchasing new stock of inventory, Karen needs financial support. He requested a loan from local financial institutions several times, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because his business isn't registered as a formal business. Karen has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products.\r\n\r\nThis loan is very important for Karen to be

She lives in Kapan town of Syuniq region and due to her kind attitude toward people and hard work, Tereza has gained many loyal customers. \r\n\r\nTo tackle financial hardship and purchase a new stock of supplies, Tereza requested a loan from local financial institutions several times, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because her business isn't registered as a formal business. Tereza has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. This loan is very important for Tereza to meet her clients' needs by providing a new stock of inventory and thus gather more income for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1406565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

The Caribbean coast is nearby to the north, so her most important business is tourism. She lives with her husband and they have three children aged 30,32 and 35. \r\n\r\nEnidia runs a general store where she sells items of stationery, cosmetics, hand and body lotions, perfumes, colognes and lingerie. She has been doing this for 2 years following a suggestion from her neighbours who encouraged her to start this business up in her home. She buys her supplies in cash from wholesale stores in the city of Baranquilla. She sells on a cash basis to neighbours and people referred by them.

She hopes this loan will enable her to have another source of family\u2019s income so as to increase her income and make for a better living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1406950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-08-16T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-15T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chanthou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Men","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pheap","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2076000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":86097.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399943370},{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":86097.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410226533},{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":86097.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420333503},{"amount":271,"local_amount":1084000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1111065.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429642698},{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":86097.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440092860},{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T10:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":86097.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450135548},{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":86097.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459240265},{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":86097.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468065473},{"amount":82,"local_amount":328000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":336189.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479283282},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1024968.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490979778}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T04:41:13Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T20:09:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Serena Driver","image":null}},{"id":588605,"name":"Martha Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marta mujer emprendedora de 31 a\u00f1os de edad soltera, su negocio es la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de artesan\u00eda de bamb\u00fa desde hace 8 a\u00f1os.

He was born into a humble family and has had to work from a very young age to make money to cover the basic needs. All of his working life he has worked as a construction worker and works contractor. Now he is working independently and has been able to earn enough to cover the family's needs. He has the advantage of being well recognised for the quality of service he provides and most of the jobs he gets are through references from work he has previously carried out and customers who are satisfied with his service. This has allowed him to gradually increase his clientele. Carlos is a hard-working, determined and responsible man.\r\n\r\nHe is now asking for this loan to buy work tools (shovel, trowels, plumb line, sledgehammers, drill).

His wife works as a water distributor. He purchases all of his raw materials from a China border city and usually brings materials in large quantities. During this time of year, demand increases drastically so he is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase putty ingredients.

","en":"Zavkia is a very honest and hardworking woman. She is married and has three children; the oldest is 20, and the youngest is 12. Her father died when she was 19. She was left with her mother, younger sister, and brother. Life was very difficult for them. Despite these difficulties, Zavkia graduated from the capitol city's Teachers' College. After classes, she would work at a bread factory to earn money to support her family. After graduating from college, she started teaching at a high school. She got married and gave birth to an invalid daughter. She got divorced, and remarried. Her husband left to work in Russia, and worked there for two years. After returning home, he began working raising livestock and as an electrician. His thoughtful wife helps him run the business. She fattens the livestock so they can be sold.

She is so excited to know that there are people who will provide economic support for her to continue her work.  She promises to be a responsible and punctual member.

The Accion representative explained the many loan programs offered by the nonprofit organization. Once he applied and received his $4,375 Accion loan, Primitivo began using the loan to purchase additional inventory supplies and a shoe stretcher, and upgrade existing equipment. \n\nWithout the loan, Primitivo would not have been able to accept more customers and give them a quick turnaround on their repairs.

His loan request was rejected every time because his business isn't registered as a formal business. Tiran has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. He needs that financial support for purchasing raw materials and making furniture.

She lives with her husband in their own house and makes her living mostly by farming. She owns three hectares of land with many cacao plants. She tries to keep them in good condition so that later the cacao pods can dry in the sun, the only way to get the aroma and flavor desired by local buyers who deliver the product to processors. She works with her husband and hires local workers for more difficult chores such as weeding between the furrows, which is part of the crop maintenance.\r\n\r\nLucia thoroughly enjoys her work because she can always be with her family.

He\u2019s a person who has worked hard so that his family would have everything they need and so that his three children can have a home, health and education.  His wife does the housework and cares for the little ones seeing to their welfare and adequate nutrition.  Two of his children attend school and also earmark some of their time to help their parents with household chores.\r\n\r\nHe is a humble, hardworking man who works growing corn, beans and sorghum.  He learned this activity from his father while still very little since he\u2019s one of his parents\u2019 older children.  He remembers that his father bought him a machete to take him along and teach him how to clear the cornfield; he\u2019d rise at dawn and work every day.  His father would tell him to learn to work to earn a living and to set a good example for his younger siblings.\r\n\r\nLater, since deciding to form his own family he\u2019s worked growing basic grains.  Today, he teaches his children to farm so that in future they can develop work skills; he also gives them space so that they can study and develop skills so that in future they won\u2019t have to work in agriculture but also be able to carry out other kinds of work.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy building supplies to repair his roof at home because the wood and the metal sheeting need to be replaced because they have holes in them.  In this way he hopes to improve his and his family\u2019s quality of life so that rain water won\u2019t drop any longer on the children while they sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen this loan is paid off he\u2019ll see if he can take out another one to add another room to his house so that he can have more, better organized, space.  Thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Campo he will be able to cover the need of repairing his house\u2019s roof which for now is his greatest priority so that his belonging will no longer get wet.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1411076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

government job, and the tight financial condition of the family, Kumari is compelled to run a grocery store and manage the family expenses. \r\n\r\nKumari is pictured with her hand raised. She is the featured borrower member of \u201cMalom Maning Leikai\u201d Group. All the members live in the same region, which is about 40 kms east of the capital state of Imphal. It is one of the state capitals for the Northeastern states in India. The members joined hands and formed the group to stand for one another in times of need, and they still continue the pledge. \r\n\r\n\r\nKumari runs the grocery store in the front yard of her house. Her husband also helps her in the store by running errands for her since he left his driving job. She sells potatoes, onions, edible oil, garlic, etc. She opens the store at the break of the dawn and closes down at late evening. She manages the household chores and also runs the store. \r\n\r\nShe usually gets the supplies from the main market and sells them. The store is a success, as she has buyers thronging in round the clock, but she is incapable of supplying the demands. The generated income is used for her children\u2019s educational fees and other household expenses, which generally paralyzes her in refilling her stock for the store. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Kumari will refill the store and manage some savings. Happy and elated, Kumari shares that she has plans to purchase an auto vehicle in the future. Her husband can drive and run the vehicle for public transportation. The store is the main source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nKiva and WSDS join hands; supporting the group is a blessing, and the group members will work harder for better performance so that each of them can make a stand financially and morally. Kumari says, \u201cThank you so much, Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in sand-sieving, weaving, and vegetable-selling businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1405826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to refill the store by purchasing imported rice, cereal items, edible oil and other commodities; then sell them and earn profits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-16T20:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-15T20:40:05Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tondon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibecha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T03:50:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":595057,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La clienta vive con sus padres en casa de ellos, es una persona luchadora y responsable.

They run a family-owned dairy farm with four milk cows. The family produces cheese and sells it in the village. In addition, they grow nuts and grapes which are used in wine production. \r\n\r\nDima sells his products seasonally, but the income is not enough to provide the family with adequate living conditions.

The start-up loan program provides credit with fewer conditions to the country's vulnerable poor for business start-ups and re-start-ups. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income, and they often do not have access to credit. \r\n\r\nWith the credit, Dima will purchase chickens and place them in a shed located in their yard.

Graduated from a government college and possessed a caring and strong personality, sincerity in work and  great determination is Linroukim\u2019s character. She is on the extreme left in the picture with her hand raised. All eight members belongs to a tribal community and live in a village which is about 40 kms away from the state capital of Imphal, which is one of the North-Eastern state capital in India. As an eldest daughter in the family, she takes on the role with passion and has shown immense sincerity in whatever she does for the family and for herself.\r\n\r\nLinroukim runs a general store in the village. The store is located at the other end of the village, on the closer side of the town market. The town market is where people from all neighbouring villages have stores and run their businesses. She sells imported rice, salt, chillies, sugar, milk, potatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, different items of cereals, detergent soap, detergent powder, hair oil, sachets of shampoo, local delicacies, etc. She is in charge of the store only in the morning and in the afternoon as she teaches in primary private school during the daytime. Her mother usually replaces her in daytime and she closes the accounts at the end of the day. \r\n\r\nLinroukim's father\u2019s income is insufficient to support the family with her three younger siblings in different schools. She initiated all possible ways to share her father\u2019s burden and started earning by opening a general store besides teaching in a school. On restricted holidays she usually gets the supplies from the town market and sells them in the village. The generated income is not enough to refill the stocks on a regular basis as her father\u2019s income in unreliable and irregular. Most of the expenditure is borne by her to fulfill the family's needs.\r\n\r\nShe wants a loan from Kiva to purchase more supplies for the store. She will buy all the essential goods like rice, edible oil, wheat by the bag, flour by the bag, soaps, shampoos etc. Expansion of the store is the vital plan as she wishes to continue the general store even after she is married. Another future plan she has with her family is to re-construct their house; the leaking roof during rainy season and the dilapidated condition of the roof and mud walls needs to change. If their plans are successful then they will build the house very soon. \r\n\r\nLinroukim thanks Kiva and WSDS for helping her achieve some portion of her plan and which will eventually become the platform to start off. She says \"thank you so much, Kiva\u201d. She also shares that she will repay the loan on time without fail and will continue to grow.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1405677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more stock like rice, soap, cereals, etc for the general store to earn more profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-16T21:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-15T21:10:08Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingchong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vunneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neishi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linroukim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sarana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T15:26:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":593809,"name":"Sarah's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah's group is made up of five women who live in the area around the city of Accra.

She earns about 37,500 Cambodian Riel (KHR) per day from this business, which she has been engaged in for 20 years. \n\nSrey is not new to VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She utilized her first loan wisely to support her business and it has returned her a decent income to improve her living, keep her kids in school, and set aside some money for future needs.  With a new loan, she leads a group of four female borrowers. She is seeking for 1,200,000KHR while her co-borrowers are seeking for 1,000,000 KHR each. Srey will spend her loan portion to buy potash and pay for transplanting fees. She hopes to grow her crops well and make a good income so  she can buy pigs to raise for extra income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1403362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy potash and to pay for transplanting fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Prey Chhor district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-08-16T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-15T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Srey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samath","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanthy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soeurn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":1800000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1830157.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479283252},{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":813403.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490979750},{"amount":400,"local_amount":1600000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1626806.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504420770}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T17:58:47Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T18:57:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy Martin","image":null}},{"id":591785,"name":"Sinat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sinat, a rural villager from Kampong Cham province's Srey Sonthor district, is 51 years old.

The women enjoy participating in the educational lessons that are part of their microcredit loan from Friendship Bridge.  The educational lesson topics range from business and money management to women's rights and health. Within their Trust Bank, they have created a circle of trust which fosters mutual support between all the women in the circle.\n\nSusana is a member of Mujeres Activas.  She is a very sociable woman who is constantly seeking opportunities to ensure her family\u2019s development. Susana is 45 years old, married to a farmer, and has six children.\n\nSusana owns a business that sells snacks to members of her community.  She sells seven days a week during the afternoons. Susana has a small space in her house that she sells the snacks from but she also sells door-to-door for the convenience of her customers. \n\nAbout 10 months ago, Susana and her oldest son opened a new business that makes and sells pi\u00f1atas and other party items. Although this venture is currently a small-scale operation, they have a plan for growing the party business. Susana is requesting a loan with Friendship Bridge to continue to expand her businesses. She intends to use the funds to buy a wagon for selling snacks door-to-door, add more items to her store and also purchase materials in bulk to make pi\u00f1atas. \n\n\"It's a blessing to have the support of Friendship Bridge because it benefits not only me, but my whole family. It allows my son and I to invest in the new business. This party business will help him continue his education. My dream is to see him graduate from college - he is already taking steps toward this goal as he is already in ninth grade,\" explains Susana.\n\nThe Mujeres Activas Trust Bank, represented by its board of directors (president, secretary and treasurer), thank their Kiva investors wholeheartedly because their help benefits towns like the one the women live in (Santo Domingo Xenacoj Guatemala), which is in need of development, and without this kind of support, their dreams would not be possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5375,"image":{"id":1399771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party

She came from the mountainous part of her region when she was five years old together with her parents, seeking to avoid the problems caused by political violence in the region. \r\n\r\nThat is how her family got into agriculture, first as workers in the area, and later as owners of their own cultivated land. Natalia thus learnt how to cultivate potato, corn, and other products grown in the mountains. When she turned 20 she got married and was able to buy one hectare of land. At present she cultivates organic cocoa and she is very pleased with her job.

She is married to Christopher and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nJosefina runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In her case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from ukay-ukay stalls. These are very much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \n\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to buy additional stock of used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an ukay-ukay stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, also used bags and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\n\nJosefina dreams of having a beautiful store and hopes to build a beautiful house.

This will be his fifth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. He will use the loan to repair his business premises and invest in his Tigo Pesa business. He used the previous loans to restock more foods items, open a pharmacy and start his M-Pesa and Tigo Pesa businesses.  The profits he receives will be used to cover household expenses and school fees.

She doesn't have any children, and she lives with her mother in her mother's home. She is a farmer and housekeeper. She has worked in agriculture for many years, and she learned how to farm from her parents, who are now elderly. Farming has been her sole means of earning an income for a long time, and it allows her to cover her basic necessities and other household expenses. \r\n\r\nIn cool seasons she also plants corn and beans. Her main customer is a business located in the same community as her.

is 37-year-old Edna. She is married and has three children aged five, ten and eighteen. In 1993, Edna established her drinks, toiletries and provisions business. She began her business because she wants to assist her husband to run the affairs of the children. Her business is located in the outskirts and her main customers are adults. Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000.

her dream of achieving a better life for her and her family. Currently, Esi is an entrepreneur. She prepares and sells Kenkey (a traditional Ghanaian dish made from corn dough and wrapped in banana leaves) for a living. She primarily sells her Kenkey in Akonoma (near Cape Coast). Her business enterprise has grown substantially since she began two years ago. She uses the income from her business to help her husband raise their two children. \r\n\r\nEsi has identified that there is growing demand among consumers for her Kenkey.

mam\u00e1, ambas se dedican a actividades de comercio; su mam\u00e1 se dedica a la compra y venta de pescado fresco y Estela se dedica a la venta de pupusas y le ayuda con el negocio a su mam\u00e1. \n\nEstela, solo tiene un nivel b\u00e1sico de estudio que  obtuvo en la escuela de su comunidad; luego dejo de estudiar ya que le era muy dif\u00edcil seguir los estudios de bachillerato, por la distancia del instituto deb\u00eda recorrer en auto bus unos 10 km y los gastos serian mayores se quedo en su casa y se acompa\u00f1o por un tiempo; pero su compa\u00f1ero de vida la dejo cuando emigro a los EEUU y a perdido toda comunicaci\u00f3n con \u00e9l.\n   \nElla es propietaria, de un peque\u00f1o negocio de venta de pupusas que vende por las tardes frente a su casa, desde hace 4  a\u00f1os trabaja de esa manera y a veces trabaja como empleada domestica, el negocio lo aprendi\u00f3 de su mam\u00e1 que siempre se a dedicado a actividades comerciales y de un trabajo que tubo en un comedor en la parte baja de la laguna, al dejar ese trabajo decidi\u00f3 trabajar de forma independiente. Su mam\u00e1 le apoya con el negocio por las tardes y ella le ayuda en la ma\u00f1ana con el negocio del pescado y los oficios dom\u00e9sticos de la casa.    \n\nAnteriormente, Estela solicito un cr\u00e9dito a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, para instalar la pupuseria que hoy en d\u00eda en su fuente de ingresos y satisfactoriamente le va muy bien, debido a que de las ganancias que ha ido obteniendo compro un cerdo de dos meses para engordarlo de los desperdicios de la pupuseria.\n\nHoy en d\u00eda, esta solicitando un nuevo cr\u00e9dito para comprar ma\u00edz, carne, repollos, salsas, aceite, el chimbo de gas propano, etc.  Para elaborar pupusas. Con el pr\u00e9stamo la cliente espera mantener el negocio existente y ampliar uno nuevo que consiste en la compra\/venta de v\u00edveres( cosas de comida) que espera vender con sus vecinos ya que a visualizado una oportunidad de negocio con esta actividad mejorando as\u00ed sus ingresos.   \n\n La cliente manifiesta que empezara con poco pero sue\u00f1a con tener una tienda mas surtida alg\u00fan d\u00eda y tener de todo para la venta no solo v\u00edveres y construir un corredor grande en la parte frontal de la casa para ubicar el negocio de las pupusas ah\u00ed; ya que actualmente le toca sacar todos los d\u00edas a la orilla de la calle la plancha de las pupusas  no tiene mesas para los clientes que la visitan.   ","en":"Estela is an enterprising young woman of 22. She lives in her mother's house. Both of them have businesses: her mother works buying and selling fresh fish and Estela works selling pupusas [stuffed tortillas] and helps her mother with her business.\r\n\r\nEstela only has a basic education that she received in her community school. Afterwards she stopped going to school because it was very difficult to continue with high school because of how far away the school was. She would have had to travel about 10 km by bus and the costs would have been high. Instead she stayed at home and was in a relationship for a period of time. But her partner left her when he emigrated to the United States and she has lost communication with him.\r\n   \r\nShe is the owner of a small business selling pupusas, which she sells in the afternoons in front of her house. She has been doing this for four years and sometimes works as a housekeeper. She learned the business from her mother who has always engaged in commercial activities and from a job that she had in a canteen in the lower part of the lake. When she left this job she decided to work independently. Her mother helps her with the business in the afternoons and she helps her mother with the fish business and the housekeeping chores in the morning. \r\n\r\nPreviously Estela sought a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo in order to start up the pupusa stand that is her current source of income. Things are going along very well since with her earnings she has purchased a two-month-old piglet to fatten with the leftover products from the tortilla stand.\r\n\r\nPresently she is seeking a new loan in order to buy rice, meat, cabbage, sauces, oil, a propane cylinder, etc. in order to make pupusas. With the loan she hopes to maintain the existing business and add a new one that consists of the purchase\/sale of supplies (food) which she hopes to sell with her neighbors, as she has recognized a business opportunity to increase her income with this activity.\r\n\r\nThe client states that she started out with little but that she hopes to have a better stocked store some day and carry all products for sale, not only groceries. She would like to build a large passageway in the front part of the house and locate her pupusa business there. Since she currently has to take the grill for the pupusas out to the edge of the street every day, she has no tables for customers who visit her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1410244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
