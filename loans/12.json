Even though she did not earn a lot of profit at first, she realized the convenience in being able to repay weekly and she also appreciated the knowledge she learned from their meetings. She continued to be a member of the Fund and borrowed more more money. Her family situation got better over time and she was able to send her children to school. Her oldest child is now the Director of a software company. Because of the current trend, together with the help of her oldest child, she invested in opening an Internet caf\u00e9. Mrs. T. had lots of customers, especially young people. Her current income is 220-250 USD\/ month. In the future, she wants to expand her Internet caf\u00e9 to serve more customers.

She started her own clothing business sixteen years ago and has been building a successful enterprise. She has a good location in the market for her sales and creates an attractive display of clothing for passing customers. She is a married woman with two children. The income she is able to make is a help to her to support her children with a proper education.\r\n\r\nInoyatkhon has requested a loan of 12,000 Somoni so that she can purchase an inventory of new clothing. This loan will allow her to increase her income by having the right clothing available to meet seasonal demand. Over the last four years, She has proven to be a great loan client with IMON International. We are glad to have this new opportunity to continue assisting her with her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Haguimit, La Carlota City. For years, she and her family lived in house made of bamboo with Nipa (palm leaves) for roofing. Her family lived a hand-to-mouth existence: her husband worked in the sugarcane fields of the sugarcane plantation where they lived. During off-season, she and her husband made charcoal to sell. Since she had some knowledge in hairstyling and sewing she supplemented their income by doing odd haircuts and curls, and some sewing on the side. With their determination to move out of poverty, they were able to send all 5 of their children to finish High School.\r\n\r\nAlicia joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in October 2002. She used her first loan to put up a small general store, and raised pigs to sell. Later, she and her husband were able to rent a 5-hectare land where they planted sugarcane and rice.  Subsequent loan cycles also enabled her to purchase a carabao and other equipment that they used in their farming ventures. With the profits from farming and her general store she was able to build a concrete house for her family. With  more stable sources of income, she was able to send her 2 youngest children to college until both graduated, but they are currently unemployed and are helping their parents in their business ventures. \r\n\r\nAt present Mrs. Alicia is on her 10th Loan Cycle with a loan of PHP 20,000.00. She needs this additional capital to help her purchase additional goods to resell  in her general store.\r\n\r\nIt is Mrs. Alicia's greatest dream to help her children improve their status in life, and continue breaking the cycle of poverty that she and her husband started in the family by the sweat of their brow.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

Margarita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000.00 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Margarita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Margarita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C.'s an entrepreneur who values her time - she says that time is gold so she does not waste any of it, if she can do something to earn money to achieve her dream faster. She is a 50-year-old widow who lives in the town of Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She has one big long-term dream and several smaller ones. Her biggest dream is to be able to renovate her house, improve her living standards and help her granddaughter afford higher education. \r\n<p>\r\nHer smaller, and maybe more immediate dream, is to be able to buy a tricycle (a motorcycle with a side car for passengers or goods) so that she can easily travel from town to town in pursuit of her business. Edna, or \"Nanay Edna\" (Mother Edna) as most people call her, has an ambulatory business selling fruits in different towns during their market day. She is so focused on her goals that she does not mind the rain or the heat of the sun if her efforts bring her one step nearer to the achievement of her dreams.\r\n<p>\r\nNanay Edna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 to increase the volume of fruits she offers for sale \u2013 in effect also increasing her income potential. She now earns an average monthly income of 10,000 pesos for her tireless efforts. She is very prompt in her payments, and follows all the rules, depositing her payment in the bank a day before the scheduled weekly NWTF-PD Center meeting. She pays directly to the bank to avoid any untoward incidents.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her previous loan, she got 19,500 pesos which was quite a lot of capital for her, but she was able to fully pay her loan on time and within the term set. This time around, for her ninth loan cycle, she has requested the same amount, 19,500 pesos, to be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital for her business. Income from the business will be used for house improvements.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":398042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional inventory and for working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-02T03:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":196.15,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9261.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004168},{"amount":130.77,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6174.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848939},{"amount":98.08,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4630.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739607}],"funded_date":"2009-10-02T06:53:39Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":145632,"name":"Melchora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melchora S. is from the village of Colonia, Valencia Bukidnon.

She is 53 years old. Elicita is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Elicita makes and sells food. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Elicita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elicita joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elicita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Elicita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the second loan taken out by Elicita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He has worked as Chief Auditor in the Revenue Office of Chantales for 11 years.  His wife also works and helps out with the household expenses.  Through a housing project, he got an opportunity to have his own house, which he is paying for.  He wants to make some improvements, such as adding ceramic tile, as the house was delivered with only concrete flooring.  He is counting on the support of AFODENIC and Kiva in order to carry out this small project, since in this way he can make his home more beautiful.

Pakistan and is also known as the heart of Pakistan. She has given birth to three children: two daughters and a son. Her eldest daughter studies in 10th standard and her youngest daughter is in 5th standard, while her son reads in 9th standard.\r\n \r\nA very talented lady, Shakeela is involved in a boutique business where she specifically prepares bridal dresses. Bridal dresses have a high demand, particularly in marriage season, and a very good profit potential.\r\n\r\nShe purchases cloth and bridal material from Faisalabad, which is famous for its textile industry, and books the orders from different boutiques. She has hired some workers who do the stitching work for her. \r\n\r\nHer husband lives abroad; he works there and sends money every month for the financial survival of his family here. \r\n\r\nShakeela has applied for a loan from Asasah for her business. With the loan amount, she will buy material such as cloth, beads and tassels in bulk and improve her business condition.

R. es una mujer de 50 a\u00f1os que vive en el barrio Siape y que no se queda quieta porque le da curso a su talento emprendedor; siempre est\u00e1 en funci\u00f3n de mirar las oportunidades, comprar, vender  y conocer nuevas personas para convertirlas en sus clientes.\nAs\u00ed ha venido trabajando durante muchos a\u00f1os,  porque desde hace 7,  se dedica a viajar Maicao,  un municipio fronterizo con Venezuela,  para  comprar  v\u00edveres como arroz, aceite,  fab, Jab\u00f3n, leche en polvo, salchicha, refrescos y hasta sabanas.  Cuando inici\u00f3 esta actividad, lo hizo con muy escaso capital y poco a poco ha ido increment\u00e1ndolo. Duve viaja con su hermana cada 8 d\u00edas, compra productos que le encargan y los distribuye a cr\u00e9dito  semanalmente, para luego recoger su cartera cada quince; sus principales clientes son sus vecinos del barrio San Salvador  y tambi\u00e9n tiene en su propia comunidad. \u00daltimamente ha encontrado  muchos de estos art\u00edculos a buen precio en Barranquilla y entonces los compra en esa ciudad. Duve  adicion\u00f3 a su negocio la venta de  calzado a trav\u00e9s de gu\u00edas especializadas y este dinero lo recoge cada quince d\u00edas y vende por encargos.\nDuve es una mujer  muy creativa y din\u00e1mica, siempre est\u00e1 en movimiento, le saca mucho provecho a sus capacidades y constantemente permanece identificando nichos de mercado donde pueda ella ganar con su trabajo; se ha dedicado siempre a lo que le gusta y ah\u00ed radica su \u00e9xito. En \u00e9poca de carnavales, Duve vende camisetas estampadas con lentejuelas que ella misma decora y este es un potencial al cual le saca dinero tambi\u00e9n, igualmente vende cerveza, sopas y hayacas, ya que aprovecha que en el sector donde vive es justamente por donde se dan los grandes desfiles del carnaval, comparsas  y es  un escenario  de gran aglomeraci\u00f3n de personas para disfrutar de estos eventos importantes en la ciudad de Barranquilla. Ella y su familia  conformada por su esposo, pensionado de una empresa, e hijos y nietos, viven en su propia casa  donde ella y su esposo permanecen  siempre unidos  y en todas las decisiones de su hogar. Este es su tercer financiamiento y Duve planea comprar v\u00edveres, en un mayor volumen porque tiene encargado, arroz, aceite, fab, jab\u00f3n, leche en polvo embutidos; ella siente que ha cambiado su vida desde que recibi\u00f3 su primer cr\u00e9dito,  porque ha tenido la posibilidad de dinero   disponible para comprar y responder  muy pronto a sus clientes. Su sue\u00f1o es ampliarlo  adicion\u00e1ndole prendas de plata porque tiene un potencial de clientes  que conoci\u00f3 en Maicao y as\u00ed se lo han solicitado, este es justamente su desaf\u00edo,  pues requiere un poco mas de capital y est\u00e1 trabajando para ello\n\n\n\n","en":"Duve M. R. is a 50-year-old woman who lives in the Siape neighborhood, and who does not just sit around, because she is giving expression to her entrepreneurial talent: she is always busy looking for opportunities, buying, selling, and getting to know new people in order to make them her customers.\r\n\r\nShe has been working in this way for many years; 7 years ago, she started traveling to Maicao, a municipality on the border with Venezuela, to buy groceries such as rice, oil, detergent, soap, powdered milk, sausages, soft drinks and even bedsheets. When she began this business, she did it with very little capital, and little by little she has been increasing it. Duve travels with her sister every 8 days, buying products which her customers request, and distributing them on credit each week; she later collects her payments every two weeks. Her main customers are her neighbors in the San Salvador neighborhood and also in her own community. Recently, she has found many of these items for a good price in Barranquilla, and thus she buys them in that city. Duve added to her business the sale of shoes through specialized guides; she sells them on order and collects the money every 15 days. \r\n\r\nDuve is a very creative and dynamic woman who is always on the move. She takes great advantage of her skills, and she is constantly identifying market niches where she can earn money with her work. She has always done what she enjoys, and that is the root of her success. During the Carnival season, Duve sells shirts decorated with sequins, which she makes herself, and this is another source of income for her. She also sells beer, soup and hayacas [a kind of tamale], taking advantage of the fact that the area where she lives happens to be the place where the great Carnival parades take place, so it is a place where great crowds gather to enjoy these events that are so important for the city of Barranquilla. She and her family, made up of her husband, who is retired from work with a company, along with children and grandchildren, live in their own house, where she and her husband always remain united in all of the decisions related to the household. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan, and Duve plans to buy groceries in greater volume, because she has orders for rice, oil, detergent, soap, powdered milk, and sausages. She feels that her life has changed since she received her first loan, because she has had the opportunity to have money available to buy merchandise and respond very quickly to her customers. Her dream is to expand her business, adding silver jewelry, because she has potential customers she met in Maicao, and they have requested this. This is her current challenge, since she needs a little more capital, and she is working toward this goal.

She lives in Acha, a small farming village in the North West Region of Cameroon. Due to ill health, she spent much of her business capital in the hospital. Motivated by other GHAPE members in her community, she joined the program in 2008. Since then, she has been trying to support her family through the loans she received form GHPAE. With this new loan, she plans to buy more palm oil and beans (cheap this season) to resell in the coming months when the prices will have gone up. This is a business she has been doing for a long time; palm oil is an indispensible commodity used in the preparation of almost every meal. Members of her community will no longer have to wait untill market day to have palm oil as most of them always buy in small quantities as needed. She will use the profit from the loan to pay school fees for her children and provide food and medication for her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE: The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":768437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

is divorced with one child. He is a taxi driver and has been in business for five years. Driving is his only source of income. Sometimes he ends up working 24 hours a day to provide for himself and his family. Presently, he makes around $30-40 per day. \r\n\r\nNikolai is a focused, hard-worker. He started his first business selling groceries in the market. However, after his divorce and changing family situation, Nikolai decided to work in a different business sphere and began driving a taxi. The nine loans that Nikolai has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped him to expand his business. \r\n \r\nNikolai is requesting a loan of $600 to help buy a newer car with improved diesel efficiency that will be both quieter and smoother running. A reliable vehicle operating on bio methane fuel, with eco-friendly fuel consumption, good emissions characteristics and better refinement will not only help Nikolai reduce his overhead costs, but will also lessen the amount of pollution produced and will increase the resource-saving capability of his vehicle. Nikolai is also getting married in May, 2007. He is planning to use income generated by his business to cover some of the expenses of his wedding.   \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u2013

She currently lives with her husband at Y Yen District of Nam Dinh Province.  She has two children who have both grown up and have a job of their own.  In the previous loans, Mrs. B. put the money in her pig-breeding and recycling materials businesses.  The majority of her own money was used for the pig-breeding business, which is also the main source of her family's income.  Normally she would be able to sell each farrow of pigs for about 500 to 700 USD.  At the same time, by collecting recycling materials and resell it, she got enough money to pay the monthly payment (for TYM) as well as for the household daily activities.  In 2004, seeing that her age would not allow her to continue with this work anymore, she moved into the husking rice business.  This business has been doing quite well, with her monthly income of around 150 USD.  In this loan cycle, she would like to ask for a loan of 450 USD to buy petroleum and repair her machines.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 11px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by Anh H.

For a very long time, we remained victims of this situation that largely contributed to the impoverishment of this village\u2019s population.  However, this region is rich in natural resources and mostly fishery products (oysters, shellfish, shrimps, cymbium and fish) . This is why we came to sollicit SEM so they could find us financing from Kiva in order for us to work. Our work will consist of fishing and transformation of fishery production (smoking, drying and salting of fish). We are also planning on selling fresh fish, because Djirack is a very important fishing harbor in the region situated nearby the resort of Cap Skirring. \r\nTranslated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva volunteer.\r\n\r\nNous habitons l'\u00e9covillage de Djirack qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 son sort depuis le d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 80, \u00e0 cause du conflit arm\u00e9 qui s\u00e9vissait dans la r\u00e9gion Sud du s\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":319928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Currently he works taking care of livestock and supervising crop land.\r\n\r\nAbdumanon eagerly waits for harvest season to see the results of his family\u2019s hard work. Everyone helped out. The expectations for a good harvest are more clear for Abdumanon, because the weather doesn't seem to be against his wish. Later on, he wants to spend more time working with livestock and growing his own feed for the cattle, which will allow him to save on costs.\r\n\r\nThis is the ninth time that Abdumanon has requested a loan from IMON International. He is committed, once more, to keep getting ahead with hard work. The money requested will be used to buy seeds and fertilizer for his harvest. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has one child. \r\n<br>Modoukpe sells cosmetics in her neighborhood in Lom\u00e9. She has been selling these products since 2005.

Rosita B. knows that and applies it daily. Rosita's life might seem ordinary: a CCT community partner at 56; married to a driver named Domingo; the mother of two children. But Rosita is ready to do something extra to make her life more than ordinary. \r\n \r\nRosita's extra effort comes in the form of small-scale businesses. At present, she rents out bed spaces to boarders. She also runs a side-car business, a means of transportation where the family lives, in Pasay City, Philippines.  Aside from that, Rosita is also a vegetable dealer. Putting these together, Rosita is able to earn around Php400 per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her businesses, Rosita would like to apply for a Php20,000 loan. This would be beneficial as it would enable her to buy extra double-deck beds and increase the number of bed spaces to rent out. The loan would also help her grow her vegetable business as she can then buy more varieties of vegetables to sell. Rosita wants to add more to the number of small-scale businesses she is presently managing. She particularly wants to put up a big business like a grocery store.\r\n\r\nRosita did not note any present challenges except for her health condition. She believes that doing extra things now such as saving up and living a healthy lifestyle will make a difference in her future and, more importantly, in her family's future.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Su mayor aspiraci\u00f3n es tener otro ingreso para poder brindar un bienestar mejor a mi familia.Este es su tercer cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP y se compromete una vez m\u00e1s a pagar en las fechas exactas, ya que su banco comunal extiende el apoyo cuando se necesita.Con los tres mil nuevos soles solicitados, invertir\u00e1 en la compra de un motocarro  y as\u00ed desea obtener otro ingreso m\u00e1s para  su hogar; adem\u00e1s comprara algunas prendas pues tiene algunos pedidos por cumplir.","en":"Susan, 29, lives with her partner, Octavio, and their son in a house that they own.  She likes to get up early so that she can work at her two jobs, as a cook and as the operator of a clothing business.  She has worked at both for 10 years.  She is happy with the work, cooking delicious food, on one hand, and selling original and unique items of clothing, on the other.  Her customers appreciate what she has to offer and come to her for what they need.  In the summer, the heat in the Peruvian jungle is suffocating so Susan's customers avoid going out when they can.  Consequently, she generally works selling clothes after 4:00pm so that she doesn't miss anyone.  Her greatest wish is to have another source of income so that she can better provide for her family.  This is her third MFP loan and she is committed to repaying it on the agreed-upon dates because the community bank provides much-needed financing.  With the three-thousand new soles loan, she will buy a motorized cart, an investment that will help her increase her family's income.  She will also buy items of clothing to fill existing orders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":692734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy a motorized cart and merchandise for clothing sales business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T22:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":461.73},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":476.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":497.44},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":506.7},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":522.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":535.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.3},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.61},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.39},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.79},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":169.3,"local_amount":461.73,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":471.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463807},{"amount":174.61,"local_amount":476.2,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":486.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887196},{"amount":182.39,"local_amount":497.44,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":508.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327555},{"amount":185.79,"local_amount":506.7,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":517.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196092},{"amount":191.61,"local_amount":522.56,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":534.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269771},{"amount":196.3,"local_amount":535.37,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":547.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549788}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T01:38:13Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":269334,"name":"Benkadi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les femmes qui composent le groupe BENKADI sont toutes mari\u00e9es, ont une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 32 ans,  3 enfants et vivent dans des familles conjugales nucl\u00e9aires avec leurs  \u00e9poux et enfants \u00e0 H\u00e8r\u00e8makono, l\u2019un  des quartiers centre de la ville de BOUGOUNI, (troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).

As a fruit of their great love, they have 10 kids and have always worked together to offer them well-being and to satisfy their needs through farming the land.  They have done this work for years as an inheritance from and for the legacy of their parents.  Even today they do this exhausting and noble labor to increase their quality of life now that each of their children has left their modest home to pursue other activities and to proviD. their own families with well-being.  With the immense desire of progress in each of their minds, each of them has decided to increase the variety of their products this harvest season with wheat and barley because these require less investment and greater profit.  In previous years, there were considerable losses because of the terrible cold that whipped their fields and didn't let them make any profits.  As a result of this event, Florencia got sick and needs to undergo a costly medical treatment.  This is why they are determined to increase their strengh and products with the objective of obtaining quick results and a lot of happiness.

Two years ago she started selling shoes and little by little she has gathered customers who seek her to buy shoes since she sells them on credit to offer her customers the opportunity to pay her back though a longer period of time.\r\n<P>\r\nHowever, because of the Christmas season, the demand for shoes has increased This is why Veronica is requesting a loan for US$475 to be paid in a period of 6 months. With this money, Veronica will be able to buy more merchandise to have a larger variety and offer her customers what they are looking for. With your help Veronica will be able to continue with her business and with the income obtained during this season she will be able to save to pay the registration fees for the next school year.\r\n<b><P>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica B. es una chica que est\u00e1 estudiando, sin embargo sus padres no cuentan con muchos ingresos como para seguir costeando los gastos que le representa la escuela.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":256208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more maize, rice and sunflower seeds in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T23:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debora R.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436426},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130698},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027495},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613496},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010575},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232866}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T00:42:40Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":88224,"name":"Mar\u00eda Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maria Mercedes pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLos Eucaliptos\u201d vive en el Jr. 3 de Octubre N\u00ba 351 - 9 de Abril, distrito de Tarapoto, departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

He considers his family his main inspiration to continue to work hard.\r\n<p>\r\nDue to his sound money management, Hotam now owns a minivan. This helps to increase his household income. What Hotam enjoys most about his work is the direct contact he has with his passengers. His business is profitable because he himself is the driver; there is no need to pay an additional salary. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with IMON International. He will use the loan to buy spare parts for his minivan. With this loan, Hotam will be able to improve his large family\u2019s livelihood. Hie wife, children and his parents will all benefit. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. Additionally, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Para ella, la agricultura es un trabajo cansado pues pasa parte de la ma\u00f1ana en cuclillas, vigilando cada planta para que pueda obtener una buena cosecha, generalmente realiza la labor sola y cuando es tiempo de cosecha contrata operarios para que le ayuden a recoger todos sus productos maduros y luego venderlos a los mayoristas de la ciudad. Esta muy satisfecha porque las ganancias que obtiene de las ventas de su cosecha, le alcanzan para ofrecerles a sus hijos una buena educaci\u00f3n en la ciudad, ya que su mayor anhelo es que lleguen a ser profesionales. Paralelamente a esta actividad, se dedica a la crianza de reses, en donde sus vacas le brindan varios litros de leche fresca diariamente. Mas adelante planea sembrar en mayor cantidad, tanto en alverja como en habas ya que quiere obtener mejores ganancias con las ventas de estas legumbres.

They visit her from time to time.  Every day she wakes up at dawn to begin her work around the farm.  She plants beans, peas, and potatoes and demonstrates great patience with her crops.  Farming is tiring work for her because she spends part of her morning squatting and inspecting each plant to ensure she will have a good harvest.  Anastacia generally works by herself, but when it is time to harvest, she hires workers to help with gathering all the mature produce that she will sell to the wholesalers in the city.  She is very satisfied because the income she obtains from the sale of her crops allows her to provide her children in the city with a good education.  Her greatest wish is for them to become professionals.  In addition to farming, Anastacia raises cattle.  Her cows provide several liters of fresh milk daily.  In order to move forward, she hopes to plant more crops such as beans and peas so that she can generate better earnings from the sale of these legumes.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  Anastacia is content with the work of her group because all of the members are very punctual with their loan payments.  She will invest her loan in the purchase of seeds for planting beans and peas, as well as fertilizers.  Anastacia will also rent a tractor to help with her next planting.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":529346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase seeds & fertilizers; pay for tractor rental","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-26T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anastacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2056.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886354}],"funded_date":"2010-04-27T02:11:14Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":199693,"name":"Sok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Sok S., 73, is a father who is blessed with three children.

SPBD's loans are Fualole's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Carlos has been working as a welder for 10 years, a business he started with his own funds. He is a widow and has seven adult children who support him. The difficult part of this business is that sometimes there is no work and money becomes scarce, making it difficult to carry out plans. Due to the economic crisis that is happening in our country, that is hurting the economy, the prices of basic groceries have increased and sometimes it is even difficult to put bread on the table. With this loan Carlos would buy construction materials to build a side wall on his house because there is a lot of crime in the neighborhood and it is necessary to take precautions. Sometimes one can sacrifice a lot to earn their possessions and then out of nowhere they are stolen. For this reason it is necessary to close off the side of the house. Carlos is grateful to the institution for giving him the opportunity to make his goals possible.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Credo, Kiva

I am 42 years old. For three years I have worked as a small businesswoman. I began out of necessity--to help my husband with household costs. Before having my business selling food to-go I had to work selling bread and cookies every weekend in the hill towns. I took advantage of my trips by bringing their orders of cheese and potatoes. Likewise, I sold chicken soup en the Chosica market, and the profit made went to household costs. I later left the job because it didn't give me enough time to take care of my children.\r\n\r\nLater I took advantage of selling hamburgers outside my home with the sandwich cart my sister lent me. To tell the truth, I didn't sell all the plates of chicken wigs and hamburgers I made in the beginning. What was left over we had to eat. I didn't stop selling because I knew with patience and perseverance that it would start to get better. With time, my number of customers grew.\r\n\r\nRecently, I fixed up a space in my house to put a little table. I installed a rolling door. I want to buy two more little tables and chairs. To buy them, I need a loan. I will also use the loan to stock up on drinks and other supplies (disposable plates and silverware, bread, sauces, hamburgers, lettuce, chicken). I will use the profits to support my son in his studies.  He is graduating high school very soon and will need the money to get a degree in automobile mechanics. At the same time, I am responsible for basic services and foods.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva

(variety) store business. She lives in Purok 1, Barangay 3, Roxas, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her store, she is gradually making her life more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $494. \r\n\r\nKrestellyn is borrowing 17,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Krestellyn hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned their respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

He shares his room with his younger brothers: Ronaldi\u00f1o and Liz.  Although he is very young he wants to support and help with the household expenses since he has several siblings.  Ever since he was a boy he has helped in the agricultural work.  When he was 15 he acquired three hectares of land where he grows peas, potatoes, olluco (a root vegetable) and lima beans.  The main difficulty he has are the limitations of his small brothers, so he decided to work hard himself.  Whenever he has time he enjoys going to the country because he also works as a transport driver and covers the route between Huaricolca - Acobamba which is a tourist spot.  He makes about 50 PEN a day.  This helps with his income.  He also sells his crops at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  He is now growing the \"andina\" potato variety and large volumes of peas.  He is sure he'll get a good profit from the harvest in a few days.  His greatest goal is to study a university degree.  He belongs to the communal bank \"San Jer\u00f3nimo de Queta\" and this is his seventh loan through MFP.  He is a gracious and ingenious member who always makes the other members laugh.  He is committed to paying back the loan on time.

She is pictured here in a group of 4 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 28 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Catherine has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nCatherine  is married and has 7 children.  She is 44 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Catherine  has been a farmer for 20 years.  Catherine's harvest was not with One Acre Fund last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nCatherine first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Catherine  joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send her children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and as an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Catherine  plans to use the money that she earns from his next harvest to send her children to school, repair their home, save for the future, and buy a cow.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Catherine\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money, and was able to feed the family.\r\n\r\nCatherine and this group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1494297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":149772,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149772}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":761729,"name":"Saul Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"jhgjhghjmvjgbhhlkjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjghb","en":"jhgjhghjmvjgbhhlkjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjghb"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1618534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"To produce organic coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Popayan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":330,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saul Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":5600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1120000},{"due_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1120000},{"due_date":"2017-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1120000},{"due_date":"2018-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1120000},{"due_date":"2019-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":570},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":570}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joan Tuttle Vargas","image":null}},{"id":778114,"name":"Dorcase Group","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe DORCASE est compos\u00e9 de trois  personnes qui sont dans le m\u00eame quartier.

She enjoys crafts and hopes to satisfy the tastes of her retail customers.  Ana considers her business to be very profitable because she is able to sell shoes to co-workers, working mothers, and neighbors.  They do not hesitate to place orders, which Ana accepts with cash or on credit.  In the future, she would like to open a clothing store where she can sell the shoes that she makes.\r\n<p>\r\nAna is receiving her 7th loan with MFP.

Cuida la calidad de los arreglos que hace, por ejemplo cuando pone una tapa en un zapato siempre a\u00f1ade tintilla y lustra el calzado para que no se note la diferencia, porque sabe que los clientes contentos son los que vuelven y ellos quieren tener su calzado usado como si fuera nuevo, por eso buscan a Wilmer. Normalmente le vienen 20 clientes y a veces hasta 30 y en estos meses entre noviembre y febrero se encuentra muy ocupado porque el nuevo a\u00f1o est\u00e1 empezando para los estudiantes y los colegiales.","en":"Wilmer  is 54 years old.  He was born in Barranquilla, but he comes from a family of shoemakers of Paisan ethnicity (from the department of Antioquia.)  He lives in the Soledad 2000 neighborhood with his wife, but he works in the La Concepci\u00f3n neighborhood to the north of the City of Barranquilla.  He is a cobbler; he offers the service of fixing shoes and in addition he purchases purses and shoes to sell to his customers.  With this work he has always supported his family and has managed to acquire his own home.  \n\nAlthough this is the first time that he is receiving a loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, he is very hopeful and happy with this new financing.  He found out about this organization because a friend recommended it and likewise he recommends it to many more people so that they can benefit like him.  \n\nHis dream is to advance his family and that every member of his family will achieve their particular goals.  He plans to replace the roof of his kiosk and improve the image of his business by painting it.  In addition he will restock his supply of purses and shoes, especially for the carnival season when sales increase.  To do this he requests a loan of $1,500 to buy ready-made purses and shoes.  \n\nWilmer works with his brother in a kiosk at the side of a church located on a corner in the La Concepci\u00f3n neighborhood where he has been located for 18 years.  Although many of his relatives are cobblers, he started working in a shoe company as a messenger.  After his brother taught him the skills of shoemaking and repair, that he himself had learned from his grandfather, Wilmer began working as a cobbler.  For 4 years he walked the streets with a small case and a box shouting \"Cobbler!\"  until the priest of the church offered him and his brother the space that they now occupy.  From the start he liked it because there was no other cobbler stand and now he has more than 800 customers. He is satisfied that his good references and letters of recommendation from his customers will serve to help him access credit.  His kiosk is located in a commercial zone, next to a supermarket and many other stores.  His customers come from all parts; they leave their shoes with Wilmer and make their purchases while Wilmer fixes them.  He is careful with the repairs that he makes.  For example, when replaces the heel on a shoe he always adds stain and polishes the shoe so that you can't tell that it's been repaired, because he knows that satisfied customers are the ones that will return.  They want to have their used shoes look like new, and for this reason they seek out Wilmer.  Normally he has 20 customers, and at times even 30.  In these months between November and February he is very busy because the new year is starting for the students and the schools.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

He is married to Hermelinda, 24, and they have a beautiful, rambunctious 4 year old son.   They live in their own home.\r\n\r\nWith perseverance and meticulousness, he was able to acquire his farmlands, which makes him very proud.  He now cultivates potatoes, peas and some vegetables.  He does this together with his wife and they have been farming for four years.  Their little boy is the engine that drives them.  What they like the most about their work is protecting their crops from plagues, the weather, and keeping everything clean in order to have a productive harvest.  What he doesn't like is having to carry the heavy bags, that weigh between 60 and 70 kilograms (130 and 155 lbs) of tubers to the markets.

The three oldest have their own families and she lives with the two minors and her mother in a highly populated neighborhood in the southern part of Lima. Giovanna's story begins one afternoon when she was sitting in the doorway of her home with her mother. She was knitting sweaters for her young children because she didn't have the money to buy them instead. Then, a stranger passed by and fell in love with her knitting. Since then, they agreed that she would give her yarn and patterns and Giovanna would take care of the knitting. She has spent 15 years knitting with her mother on the sofa in their home, making sure the thread does not get dirty, since the garments will be exported to Italy. She feels good about her work and is content with what she does, since these earnings help proviD. for her children.  Likewise, she invests the surplus in the purchase of beauty products, since her goal is to increase her income in order to pay for her children's education in the future.

Because he is a great entrepreneur, conscious of business opportunities, who sells an assortment of catalogue merchandise, he urged his wife-a woman who has his admiration and support and is a mother to the entire community-to do the same.  Now she too generates additional income for her family and business with this new activity; both spouses sell lots of products.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She lives in District 1, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her butcher shop, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 20,000. Tessie is now borrowing PHP 29,500 to fund operations. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Tessie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Five years ago he joined his life with Medalit, the mother of his two children, Jean and Manuel. Wilfredo and his family live in his mother\u2019s house, in the town of Alto Sanchirio, in the district of San Luis de Shuaro, in the province of Chanchamayo. \r\n\r\nHe works arduously in the field of agriculture. On his three parcels of productive lands he has planted coffee and bananas. The chores in the jungle are intense, as weeds grow rapidly, and so you have to constantly clear the sown fields. He also has to fertilize four times a year, spending 1,000 soles each time. \r\n\r\nWilfredo loves his work. From the time he was young he learned to get around in the field. He has more than ten years in this activity and he has faced problems such as pests, bad weather and low prices. But even so he continues working. He is clearing out the tended crops so that later he can make a coffee nursery, which earns 400 to 500 per thousand.\r\n\r\nWilfredo is a tireless man. In his free time he does carpentry work such as burnishing wood and helping out in construction work.

Her husband, a military M., was also stationed far from home and her children were young and still attending school. \r\n\r\n<p>She joined the TYM Fund in 1994 and borrowed 200,000 VND for her first loan to purchase pigs for rearing. There was no profit from the first year of rearing pigs because she did not own many pigs. But the following year, with the help of money from the TYM Fund, she expanded the pig pen and purchased more pigs. Each herd of pigs she raises consists of 25 to 30 pigs and each year she raises 3 herds for income after operating expenses of about 25,000,000 VND. In this way, her family has been able to improve their financial situation - she has been able to purchase household items for her family and specially has even been able to purchase a piece of land (100 square meters) right on street 131, which will be convenient for business and trade in the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, she is still raising pigs and chicken to further improve the family\u2019s financial situation. In the pen, there are about 30 pigs preparing for economic conversion. Her husband is now stationed closer to home and receives a salary of 3,000,000 VND, which also provides a lot of support for her. Because of that, they are able to repay weekly rather successfully. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She wants to continue to participate in the Fund for a long time to raise money to improve economically. For this loan, she would like to raise 19,000,000 VND to invest in her animal rearing business. The family\u2019s average income is 5,000,000 VND per month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Catherine Tran, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc khi ch\u01b0a tham gia Qu\u1ef9 ch\u1ecb l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng l\u00e0 ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu c\u00f2n ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i nh\u1ecf l\u1ebb v\u00ec kh\u00f4ng c\u00f3 v\u1ed1n \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, h\u01a1n n\u1eefa ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 b\u1ed9 \u0111\u1ed9i l\u1ea1i xa nh\u00e0, c\u00e1c con c\u00f2n nh\u1ecf v\u00e0 \u0111ang \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

is 48 years old, separated from her husband, she lives with her two children Ruth and Jhon. With great effort and many years Hilda opened a shoe shop and she has had this business for 12 years, and in that time she has learned the tricks of the trade, so to speak. The shoes that Hilda produces are sold in different markets throughout the city of Juliaca. The work is tiring, she works all day to produce the quantities that are needed, and thank God, she tells us, she can count on the support of her children and an assistant, to provide the help in making and distributing the shoes. What Hilda enjoys the most is creating new models, the most difficult is finishing the shoes on time for the orders that she has. Ruth and Jhon, her children, are the most important people in her life, the reason she gets up every day and works so hard to provide them a better life. With the money from the loan she will buy material that she is missing to produce greater quantities of shoe and in this way, with time she hopes to have a great shoe store.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><P>\r\n\r\nHilda tiene 48 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 separada de su pareja, vive con sus dos hijos Ruth y Jhon.\r\nCon mucho esfuerzo y varios a\u00f1os de trabajo Hilda puso un taller de producci\u00f3n de calzado y se ha venido dedicando a este negocio desde hace 12 a\u00f1os, tiempo en el cual ha aprendido los gajes del oficio.Los zapatos que produce Hilda son vendidos en los diferentes mercados de la ciudad de Juliaca, el trabajo es cansado, trabaja durante todo el d\u00eda para producir las cantidades que son requeridas, gracias a Dios, nos dice, cuenta con el apoyo de sus hijos y con un ayudante, el cual la ayuda en la elaboraci\u00f3n y distribuci\u00f3n de los zapatos.Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Hilda, es crear nuevos modelos, lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es terminar los zapatos a tiempo para los pedidos que le realizan.\r\nRuth y Jhon, sus hijos, son la raz\u00f3n m\u00e1s importante, por la cual se levanta todos los d\u00edas y trabaja a favor de darles una vida mejor.\r\nCon el dinero del pr\u00e9stamo comprar\u00e1 el material que le est\u00e1 faltando para producir m\u00e1s cantidades de zapatos y as\u00ed, con el tiempo tener una gran tienda de calzado."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":198811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy materials to make shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-09-05T22:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-19T23:38:27Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":152.31,"processed_date":"2008-10-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":161.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":366740},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":147.69,"processed_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":156.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335859},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":159.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957037},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:08:12Z","rounded_local_amount":159.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227287},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":159.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422526},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":159.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115750}],"funded_date":"2008-09-05T23:38:27Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null}]}
