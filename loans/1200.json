Nancy works in agriculture because, since she was very young, she has always supported her parents who worked as farmers growing organic cocoa and barbasco (a plant that is used in traditional fishing). This is how she learned everything she needed to know to do this work in a way that would make it very economically beneficial. When she turned 20, her parents left her 4 blocks of land planted with cocoa and, together with her partner, she began working for her family's wellbeing. Her work in the fields brings her good income as, along with her partner and some contract workers, she constantly tends the cocoa trees so that at the end of the season the pods are in good condition to be sold at the collection centers in her area. For environmental reasons, she only uses organic fertilizers on her land. One of her greatest inconveniences is transporting the heavy sacks full of dried grains from their land to the city as the access routes are narrow and this means she has to spend more money. This is her first loan from Kiva and she feels grateful to receive the loan as it will enable her to press ahead with her business.

She has done this job for 20 years and her family\u2019s total income is about 10,000,000 VND per month. Her challenge in working is a lack of capital to invest in her grocery store and a lack of sentiment in her life. Her dream is having more capital to buy more kinds of goods for her store, and that her children will have a successful future. This loan is one of the steps that will help her achieve her dream. She will be able to buy more goods to sell, earn greater profits and save these for her dream. \r\n\r\nOanh is a hardworking woman and a passionate businessperson. She has participated in SEDA\u2019s micro finance program since 2009. In the last loan cycle, she borrowed 9,632,000 VND and repaid it on time.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of seven children. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. For many days his rickshaw has not been working properly and he has been unable to generate any income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to a lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore Atiya, as a member of a two-person lending group, has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help him continue his business.

years old. I have been a butcher for most of my life. I learned from my father everything I know about the butchery business; 10 years ago I became independent.

She is married and has four children between the ages of 2 and 15 years old. They are very poor and don\u2019t generate much income as she is a housewife and her husband works doing manual labor as a helper. When people need to carry or transport things, they hire and pay him to do it. This type of work serves as the main income for his family along with the small amount they receive as social help. \r\n\r\nThey live in very bad conditions and they are unable to afford to have water installation inside the house. This means that their toilet is outside the house, which makes it difficult for them to live.

Her whole family works in the same business, which involves packaging pieces of biscuits and then selling them in the market. Khalida's husband has a job in a biscuit factory. He buys cracked or small pieces of discarded biscuits at a very low rate. He brings these biscuits home to his wife. Khalida sorts according to size, quality, and type, and she categorizes the biscuits. Her daughter packs the cookies into polythene and then Khalida's husband sells the biscuits in the market. Each family member has different duties assigned to them for packaging the cookies.\r\n\r\nRetailers like to buy these biscuits due to the low rates, and children also like to eat these biscuits. Shopkeepers have demanded more biscuits in order to increase their sales. For this reason, Khalida requested a loan of 40,000 Rs. from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan. With this loan, Khalida will buy more biscuits so that she can meet the demand of the retailers.\r\n\r\nKhalida is very thankful to Kiva's field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1408021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She completed primary education thanks to the support of her parents. \r\n\r\nHer customers are owners of local grocery stores and shops in the area where she lives and its surrounding communities.\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges that faces people who work in agriculture is the increasing cost of agricultural inputs that they use to grow and care for their crops.

She completed her primary education thanks for the effort and financial support of her parents, for which she is very thankful.\r\n\r\nTogether with her partner, she works growing corn and beans. She has many years of experience doing this work, since it has been the source of income for her and her family. Her customers are middlemen, grocery stores, neighbourhood shops, and relatives and friends who live in the area, or who travel to the area to buy her products.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan from COMIXMUL to buy fertilizer (12 quintals of 18-46-0 [diammonium phosphate] fertilizer) and nine quintals of urea, to protect and fertilize her corn and bean crops. In this way, she will be able to care for her crops better.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to be able to grow coffee, since her land and the local climate are suited to growing this crop.

Her husband is also doing the same work in a firm, but he earns an insufficient income to support his family alone. Therefore, he brings some embroidery work home for her. She helps her husband in his work and also sells knitted embroidery in her town. At this time she has attained a regular list of customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income.\r\n\r\nShe is a mother of 2 children and is motivated to provide for her family. To cope with the increasing demand of her customers, she requested a loan of 35,000 PKR to purchase a machine for embroidery. She hopes to get a boost in her earnings through her large sales. She wishes to utilize a portion of revenue to provide a quality education for her children.\r\n\r\nShumaila is very thankful to the Kiva and the BRAC

The source of income for the family is a small scale agricultural business. In particular, milking cow whose milk is sold locally. Besides this, Iuri cultivates a plot of land and sows various of vegetables, which are used for feeding.\r\n\r\nAs the existing income is not enough for food and every day expenses, Iuri decided to purchase a car and start a taxi business. However, he would have to charge higher prices for his service because the price of benzene is high. Not many citizens could afford to use the taxi service at a higher price. Because of the above mentioned problem, Iuri will change his car's fuel system from benzene to gas, which is cheaper than benzene and will reduce the cost of transportation by 40 to 45 percent.

Women usually don\u2019t raise cattle. If they do, they also assist their husbands, but Nengthem raises cattle and is also involved in ginger farming. \r\n\r\nNengthem is the featured borrower member for Ebion Group. She is pictured with her hand raised on the extreme left in the picture. The village where she and the other group members reside is about 45 kms away from the capital town, and it is a hilly region. Her husband is a builder, and he builds wooden houses and fixes wooden doors, windows, etc. His earning is unreliable, as it is entirely based on availability of work. The meagre income of the family is supplemented by Nengthem as well, by selling ginger and raising livestock.\r\n\r\nNengthem grows ginger on the hill slopes near the village. She also grows other vegetables, but her main produce is ginger. She also sells livestock in the village and nearby villages. The livestock are taken to the ginger fields in the morning, and they graze on the fields. They are brought back home in the evening when they are coming back from work. \r\n\r\nSince the lamb\u2019s main feed is grass, it is easier to raise them, as there is no extra expense on livestock feed. She can manage both the activities without much effort, and she also helps generate more income with selling ginger and livestock. With the present income, she could not afford to purchase more lambs, as the income is used for household expenses and other expenses. \r\n\r\nNengthem wants a loan to purchase three or more lambs. She will rear them in her field, and she can also work on her ginger farming without any disturbances. Once they are fully grown, then she can sell them. \r\n\r\nShe usually sells the ginger to the women vendors in the town market, as well to the vendors in the main market. She is glad that Kiva and WSDS are cooperating to develop the underserved women; she is trying to generate income for the family and herself to make a stand in the society.\r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS once again.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1405114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase three or more lambs, rear them, and sell them for profit when fully grown.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-17T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-16T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chongneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veineichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengthem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T14:47:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":594282,"name":"Damalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Damalie is a single mother of five children and four of them go to school.

She is the mother of 2 children.  Both are too young and are fully dependent upon their mother.  Her husband owns a clothing business where he buys fabrics from wholesalers and sells them to retailers.  He has a lot of customers who like to buy fabrics from him.  Sometimes he purchases fabrics from outside of the city at low cost and sells them to retailers.  He has a good reputation in the market and his current customers refer his fabrics to other retailers, which creates advertisement.\r\n\r\nDue to new customers, the demand is increasing day by day.  However, he does not have sufficient funds to buy more fabrics.  Therefore, Shamshad requested a loan of 50,000 PKR from BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband could buy more fabrics to fulfill the demand.\r\n\r\nShe is in her 6th loan cycle and has shown excellent repayment behavior.  She has already been taking the loan from BRAC and investing in the business.  Shamshad hopes that the savings will increase and that she will be able to complete the remaining construction of her house. \r\n\r\nShamshad dreams for the bright future of her children, for the establishment of the business, and for a better living standard for her family.  She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

is a 22-year-old married woman, living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. She is the mother of one daughter. \r\n\r\nHer husband has recently established a gas station in which he sells liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to rickshaw drivers. Previously, he has not had any proper work to earn income for his family. In his area lot of people drive auto rickshaws and there is lot of demand for fuel, so he decided to open a gas station so that he could earn maximum profit. This strategy became the cause of establishment of gas station in no time. He started this business with very low capital and does not have sufficient amount to buy more LPG cylinders to fulfill the demand. Due to the rapid increase in the demand for LPG, Humaira's husband wants to buy more gas cylinders so that he can easily fulfill this demand.\r\n\r\nHumaira wants her husband to establish his business well, so that she can make some savings to ensure the secure future of her children. Humaira is very pleased about this cooperation and very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1408194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy LPG gas cylinder for gas station.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nNelsa dreams that her business will flourish and hopes that her children will finish their studies.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Akbar usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, and resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar. He sells milk and yoghurt to the neighbors. Milk and meat selling brings an income of 400 AZN per month. \r\nMilk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce. Milk products are considered to be very healthy and are also present in everyday life. This is the only financial income in his family and is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved daughters.

She and her husband live with their daughter, son-in-law, and two grandchildren in a home they own. Elva runs a game room with pool tables in her home, where she welcomes customers who come to her place from all over. She only rents the tables to adults because she is aware of the potential negative effects of this activity, especially on children. She started the business more than two years ago because she already had pool tables that she had brought from another place where she'd lived before and installed in her current home with her children's help. Thanks to her efforts, her business is doing very well. Luckily, she has her husband's unconditional support, which helps her keep going. She supplements her income by selling snacks and soft drinks. She is requesting 3000 soles. She is grateful for the opportunity and for the help people are giving her to obtain this financing, which will help her improve her business. She is committed to making all her payments on time.

With this loan, she will be able to improve the productivity of her farm, thus augmenting her yield and profit. In the future, Elizabeth has plans of making her farming venture a success and a stable source of income.

not married, and has an adult daughter of the age of 21. After having lived in a civil marriage for 10 years, Irina was left alone. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, while looking for a source of income for her small family, Irina began selling men's and women's clothing at the market in the village of Kaindy, using 6000 som (KGS) as her starting capital. Since the trade was not very profitable, Irina sold off her inventory and from 2006 to 2007 worked as a saleswoman at a store. As her next step, Irina decided to lease a nearby shop that sells detergents, soaps, and cosmetics. Thanks to her tenacity, persistence, and daily work, Irina was able to develop her business, using the profits to buy an apartment in the village. \r\n\r\nIn order to broaden the assortment of goods, and also as she intends to purchase the space where she trades, Irina turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS). Irina plans to invest the income from the loan in arranging work for her daughter, who graduated from college of medicine this

She was born in a village which has good conditions for livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. Zebiniso's family had a low income, and since childhood she helped her parents with cattle breeding and field crop cultivation. \r\n\r\nAfter having finished high school, Zebiniso got married to a livestock breeder, and helped her husband with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. They mainly worked with livestock breeding, that is, they bought cattle at a low price at the market, fattened it for some time and resold it at a higher price. Due to unfavorable weather and climate, their business did not have positive results. Therefore, Zebiniso's husband went to the Russian Federation as a migrant worker. Zebiniso's family lived through this period only on the income from the livestock breeding. After this, Zebiniso started working with livestock breeding on her own. Zebiniso keeps cattle on fodder which she produces herself. For the income received from the business, Zebiniso would like to improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\nLast year (in December 2012), Zebiniso's husband returned from Russia, and for some time he helped his wife in managing the cattle breeding business. Currently, Zebiniso's husband wants to travel to Russia for work again. Therefore, Zebiniso turned to Kiva and its partner IMON with an aim to receive a loan to purchase plane tickets for her husband. She would like to continue her business of cattle breeding. Zebiniso hopes for your charity and mercy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1408104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer

Cholpon divorced from her husband after the birth of the children. Her neighbors describe her as an accurate, demanding and responsible woman. She has secondary education. \r\n\r\nIn search of income for her small family, Cholpon has worked in private business since 1983. She rents a small cafe with a pool table. She started this business with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Cholpon's persistent work, she was able to develop her business.

Her husband is also working to help her provide for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nDelia hopes to expand her business and dreams that her family will always remain in good health. She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and she finds strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance
