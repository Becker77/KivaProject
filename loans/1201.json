He is married with three children. However, he also takes care of two widows and their children by providing them with basic needs, since they lost their husbands who were responsible for taking care of them.\r\n\r\nHabib drives a taxi to earn a living. He started this job in 2003 after failing to find formal employment, yet still needing to meet the growing needs of his family. Habib mostly deals in town transportation service.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have another taxi so that he can earn higher wages. This would help him provide the best for his family and many dependents.\r\n\r\nHis major challenge is lack of enough money to purchase a taxi, therefore he needs a loan to help him purchase a taxi.

He is married and the father of two adult children. \r\n\r\nAhrorjon has been busy with farming and animal husbandry for nine years. Thanks to his good experience in this field, he grows wheat and potatoes with a high degree of success. He also fattens cattle, but it brings in little income. It does not allow him to provide for the needs of his family and repair his house, because his family is large and needs a big and comfortable house.

For the past ten years, Sylvia has been working hard to manage her drug shop, which sells drugs. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sylvia has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more medicine to sell, and will help Sylvia to generate greater profits and take care of her family\u2019s needs. Sylvia hopes that in the future, she will be able to become a very powerful entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nSylvia is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

age, married and has eight children who all attend school. He also takes care of three dependents because their parents are incapable of meeting their needs such as school fees and clothing among others.\r\n \r\nMagidu drives a taxi to earn a living. He started this job 20 years ago after failing to find formal employment and yet he had to meet the growing needs of his family. Magidu primarily does town service transportation, that is, he works around the city and in rare cases he is hired to go to the countryside.\r\n\r\n His major challenge is that, for the twenty years he has worked, Magidu has failed to purchase his own taxi, mainly because his employer pays him little money yet he has many responsibilities as a father. He therefore has  approached Ugafode Microfinance Limited (MDI) to provide him with a loan to complete the sum needed for an old taxi that he will call his own.\r\n\r\nMagidu\u2019s dream has always been to have his own taxi which will able to earn him higher wages than he gets from his boss, such that he can provide the best for his family.Thanks to Kiva lenders through Ugafode for making his dream come true.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1408785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to complete the sum needed for a taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rubaga Road","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-08-18T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-17T22:50:04Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juma","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magidu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":1000002,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1006535.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880136},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":999998,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1006531.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983798},{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1006533.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635892},{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":1000002,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1006535.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863330},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":999998,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1006531.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752409},{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1006533.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233399}],"funded_date":"2013-09-11T18:23:14Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:55:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":594593,"name":"Aifai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aifai is a 40-year-old woman who is married with six children.

She is the responsible mother of two sons and four daughters. She always tries her best to provide better facilities for her children but belongs to a poor family. Her husband is the only person in the family who is earning but his net income is too low to meet the household needs. He owns a cosmetic shop in the market which is the only source of income for his family.  His customers love the variety he offers. \r\n\r\nSarfaraz is the group leader of this two-person lending group. She has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to purchase products for his shop. He will use the loan amount to purchase a variety of cosmetics like make-up kits, facial creams, hand lotions, scrubs and perfumes. \r\n\r\nSarfaraz will use the profit amount for her children's educational expenses. She hopes that this loan will prove beneficial for her and her husband's shop and that he will buy a variety of cosmetics according to the latest trends. Sarfaraz is feeling happy and relaxed after taking out this loan. She is thankful to all of the BRAC Pakistan team and Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1408867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

With the loan, he would like to buy more fertilizers and pay labor costs for use during rice production. The profits from the business will be used to reinvest in the rice farming.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He is married and the father of 6 children. He has spent his whole life in the country, where he learned farm work and has done it for most of his productive life. His last job lasted 4 years. He worked as a farm laborer in flower cultivation, but a year ago he had the opportunity to become a partner in a farm and run it. He signed a contract in in which expenses, costs and profits are divided in equal parts. This has allowed him to generate the income he needs to support his home. He is a driven, enterprising, hardworking man. He says that his age is no barrier to do what he likes   and he has fought tirelessly to overcome obstacles that come along due to the high costs of agricultural materials. He has not had a constant cash flow because his customers pay him every three months. That is the reason he is asking for the help of the loan in order to invest it in paying for some monthly expenses (payroll, shipping, and utilities). These are expenses that can't wait and this way he can continue supporting his crop. Rodrigo dreams of having his own crop, whose earnings would allow him to continue paying his basic household expenses and enjoy and calm old age at his family's side.

She has four children (two daughters and two sons). She has an average education. After finishing middle school Aybubu married at a young age. She has been engaged in agriculture since 1993, mostly in livestock and arable farming, which she began with a 7,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni Loan. Her spouse and children are active and support the business. Her family is close and united. Thanks to her hard work and patient character, Aybubu currently has a good farm: two dairy cows, two calves, and ten sheep. Also she has 1.2 hectares of irrigated land on which she grows potatoes and perennial grasses. With profits Aybubu could breed livestock for the farm and improve her family's well-being. In order to develop her farm Aybubu asked the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 20,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni to buy calves. With the income from the loan Aybubu plans to further increase her number of livestock, and intends to finish the house in which she lives with her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1408188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy gobies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aral village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-19T02:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-18T02:40:01Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aybubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5203.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426993},{"amount":318.75,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":15611.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942560}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T13:11:28Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Terrin","image":225925}},{"id":594685,"name":"Salem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salem is 20 years old.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She is the mother of 2 children, 11 and 8 years old, and lives in a common-law marriage with her partner. Six years ago, along with her husband, she began her own business, a small store with groceries and vegetables. At first the store was located in a rented space, but later she had to move it to her house because the other space got sold. This idea came about because of the economic necessity they had. Her husband was without work and their living conditions were precarious. She explains that they had the advantage of not having much competition because of the fact they are located in a rural area. \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela is an active, thriving, and entrepreneurial person. She always works hard to help her children get ahead, so this is why she works long days every day, from 6:30 am to 9:00 pm, with the goal of making the most of her time. This business has generated the income necessary to support her household and to buy her own house. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan with the goal of buying fixed assets (a panoramic vitrine for exhibiting products) and making improvements to the space (expanding the store). This will allow her to have a larger business and to improve the business\u2019s image.

She is a very energetic and goal-oriented woman.  In her time off, she works around the house, takes care of their cattle, and, besides this, she and her family rent a plot of land from a farmer where they grow crops and feed for their cattle.  Salomat\u2019s salary is barely enough to live on.  Her husband is working in Russia and sometimes he cannot send money for months at a time, which makes it hard on Salomat.  \r\n\r\nThis year, Salomat\u2019s son graduated from the economics department of an institute in the Kyrgyz Republic.  The years when her son was in school were complicated for the family because most of their money went to his education and they had to be frugal with everything.  \r\n\r\nIn 2012, Salomat found out about a course for women that are put on by the Association of Business Women.  She took part in the course and started her own business.  Salomat bought a milk cow and a separator, and she and her daughter went in to business making and selling dairy products.  Not long ago, Salomat betrothed her daughter and the wedding will be at the end of this month.  However, the money her husband sends and her own savings aren\u2019t enough to cover all the expenses.  And so, having consulted with her family, Salomat applied for a loan of 5,000 somoni (TJS) to put on her daughter\u2019s wedding celebration.

","en":"Aychurek is 54 years old, married, and has three children (one daughter and two sons). She has a vocational high school education, having graduated from the medical vocational school as a nurse. From 1981 to 1987 she worked as a nurse in a kindergarten. Since 2003 she has been a nurse at a OB-GYN clinic. Her colleagues describe her as responsible, goal oriented, and kind. Her husband and children help around the house. Her family is friendly, with good relations between all members. Her daughter is married and lives apart from the family. Her second son is working in Russia and sends money to his parents monthly to help them financially. The younger son works in a dairy factory. Aychurek has raised livestock and farmed since 1992 to provide an additional source of income for the family. She began the business with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work, Aychurek now owns a milk cow and 10 sheep, as well as 1.85 hectares of land where she grows beans. Her  farming activities bring her around 5,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk, which helps cover the family's living and food expenses. Income from the business allowed Aychurek to raise and provide for her children. In order to further develop her business Aychurek came to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a 50,000 som (KGS) loan to buy cows. Aychurek plans to invest income from the loan into further expansion of her property. She also hopes to marry off her younger son.

She is married, and has a four year old daughter and two year old son. Her husband is currently overseas working. Ganiyakhon rents a workshop where she bakes breads and delicious fatirs (national layered cake) every day. She takes the goods straight from the workshop, still hot, to the market for sale. Her goods sell fast and she receives a good daily profit. Her mother-in-law helps with the business. She actually learned the business from her. She also has a helper. Ganiyakhon needs a loan for business development. She will use the loan to buy flour, sugar, butter, kefir, and baking soda for baking. She is a very good baker and her goods always turn out delicious.

All of her life she has been a housewife, but with the idea of earning income to support the family finances, she decided to start her own business selling food like cakes, empanadas, tortas and soft drinks. She has been doing this for eight years and learned about cooking from her mother when she was young. Libia is an active, enthusiastic, positive and very hardworking person. In the mornings she takes care of various household tasks, and in the afternoons she sells her products. She is requesting the loan to purchase a bigger fryer, tables and chair, and wholesale ingredients like vegetables, oil and chicken. With these items, she will be able to better organize her business, improving its image and her customers' perception, as well as increase her sales and income.

Thanks to a previous loan he installed a heating system and had a good harvest of early cucumbers and tomatoes. However, because of low prices Sergei didn't receive the income he expected. Sergei is now planting seeds for a second harvest. He is asking for a 10,000 hryvnia loan to buy seeds, fertilizer, and wood for heating. Thanks to the second planting he can harvest and sell vegetables until Christmas and thus earn additional income. Beside growing vegetables, Sergei and his wife also started a new business - selling groceries. They bought a kiosk, brought in goods, and are beginning to earn their first clients, as they sell both what they grew themselves in the greenhouses, and packaged groceries such as grains, sugar, tea, etc. "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":931265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his second crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-08-19T03:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-18T03:40:01Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergei","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.67,"local_amount":437.4,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":444.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874581},{"amount":1195.33,"local_amount":9562.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":9707.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440006053}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T08:36:54Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:25:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":596658,"name":"Ruth Beatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruth, tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ada y su compa\u00f1ero de vida tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, disfruta de un hijo, el cual tiene tres a\u00f1os de edad.

Ramaz is jobless at the moment. There is a high unemployment rate in the region especially among people up to 40 and Ramaz is unable to find a suitable and well-paying job.  Ramaz\u2019s spouse is the only one who makes money in the household, working as an apothecary at the pharmacy. Her monthly wage is approximately $180 which is hardly enough for food and everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nAccording to the government\u2019s estimate, the family belongs to the \"vulnerable poor\" category and gets small assistance (45 USD per month). As the living conditions are very poor, Ramaz decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions have rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Ramaz applied for a loan from MFO Credo. His request was approved within the framework of their Start Up program, a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $3000 will help Ramaz to purchase a secondhand car.

Her husband was the sole breadwinner of the family; Nargis felt it obligatory to change her family\u2019s living standards.\r\n\r\nHer hard work helped her establish a good clientele, but she was having difficulty in fulfilling large orders. That\u2019s when her sister advised her to borrow from Kashf Foundation. She has requested 25,000 PKR (Pakistani rupees), and her loan will be used to purchase a new stitching machine with some spools of threads in various colors. She hopes to get an increase in her earnings and wishes to spend part of the profits on the betterment of her family members.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1408714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a new stitching machine with some spools of threads in various colors.

is 38 years old, living in the Gurjaani district with her retired mother and three children. Nino is widowed. She works as a baker at the local bakery and works hard all day long to earn a living. Her children are school aged and get a monthly orphans pension from the government. The family lives in poverty and gets a small-sized social assistance as well. Besides, Nino grows tomatoes on the plot of land and sells them seasonally. The family owns a horse which is used in wood transportation from the forest. Nino\u2019s son sells the wood to locals during winter. But the existing income is modest and not enough for covering everyday costs. That\u2019s why Nino decided to start up a trading business with a loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Nino\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she didn\u2019t satisfied their requirements. She received this credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so-called Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With this loan of 800 GEL she will purchase household items: blankets, bed-clothing, vessels, etc at wholesale prices and sell them in her community. Her regular customers will be her co-workers and neighbors. It is obvious that the job is hard for Nino, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her business gradually. The Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased thanks to Kiva Lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1409001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase household items for selling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Akhasheni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-19T06:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-18T06:30:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nino ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":57.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":59.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":61.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":64.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":66.61},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":69.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":70.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":72.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.67,"local_amount":61.87,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":64.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857651},{"amount":36.02,"local_amount":57.64,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":59.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134328},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":59.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":62.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107909},{"amount":38.17,"local_amount":61.08,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255443},{"amount":39.62,"local_amount":63.39,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":65.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019573},{"amount":40.45,"local_amount":64.72,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:10:57Z","rounded_local_amount":67.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670680},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":66.61,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":69.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141307},{"amount":227.95,"local_amount":364.72,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":377.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467957039}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T16:28:06Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:21:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":594751,"name":"Tim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tim, aged 33, is married and has two children.

Thus, all family members help each other with daily tasks. Reyna has been a farmer for many years, since it was her parents who, in keeping with family tradition, taught her to till the land. Reyna's speciality is coffee crops, to which she has been tending for over 10 years with her husband's help and which constitute her family's sole source of income. The land they use belongs to them, half thanks to a legacy made by her father, and half bought by the sweat of their brow. The couple embarked on this productive development activity, which provides their daily bread, out of a need to improve their income and thus their children's standard of living. Reyna asked field partner COMIXMUL for a loan in order to buy 12 quintals of fertiliser, 12 quintals of urea, and 10 quintales of coffee-plant growing mixture, which will enable her to tend to her coffee crops and profit from the expected plentiful harvest.

He lives in a common-law marriage with his partner. From a young age, he learned about farm work from his father. He currently lives on a rented plot of land where he grows potatoes, beans, and peas. He harvests the crops and sells them in the marketplace in his municipality.

His greatest challenge is paying for the supplies he needs to take care of his crops, because they are quite expensive. He has also had some problems because the price of his harvest is variable and unstable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he has applied for a loan to invest in the purchase of farm supplies such as manure, fungicides, fertilizer, and seeds to continue with his business, which has become his main source of income. He will then be able to produce a better-quality harvest and sell his crops at a higher price in the marketplace, increasing his profit margin. This will help him to accomplish his dream of expanding his crops in the medium term and having favorable financial stability, which will allow him to give his children an excellent education and

He started the produce business to have a source of income and he has seen the business grow from one level to another since 1993. \r\n\r\nMax hopes to buy maize which he will stock and sell at a later stage, when the demand is high, hence fetching for him more profits, which he hopes to use to educate his children. His major clients are small traders and schools in Bushenyi area. The main challenge that he faces in the business is price fluctuation which severely affects his income. However, with the loan funds (UGX 2,000,000), he hopes to buy maize and beans in bulk and sell them later, when the prices are normal and favorable for him."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1409091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

To achieve her goal, Griselda has enrolled in the Universidad Domingo Savio. She plans on graduating in December, 2013, but without a loan from Vittana, she thinks that she may need to take time off to work and save until she can return to school. \r\n\r\nGriselda plans on using the loan to cover the cost of her graduation fees. Often, there are fees for earning your title in business before graduating. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her responsibilities at school, Griselda currently works as a teaching assistant to help her afford her school and living expenses. She currently works 25 hours a week and earns $5 a day. \r\n\r\nWith a career in business, she expects to earn $20 a day, a substantial increase from before. With two older siblings, Griselda is unsure how she will be able to afford her tuition fees on her own without the assistance of a Vittana Loan.

He learned the trade on the job and then perfected his work through practice. He sells his high-quality products to family, friends, neighbours as well as to businesses located in his home town and more distant towns. \r\n\r\nNelson is dedicated to his work. He is enterprising and loves his family wholeheartedly. It is for them that he works hard every day. He is now seeking his sixth loan; the previous ones were a big help to him and his business. The loan money will be used to buy supplies (shoelaces, fabric, rubber, glue) at wholesale prices, and to repair a broken piece of equipment which is vital to his work. He will be able to use it to improve production. Nelson will be able to finish developing a line of runners which he had to stop because of a lack of supplies. The machine will help him streamline the process and improve the quality of the finished products. In turn this will lead to increased sales and income.\r\n\r\nNelson's dream is to be able to generate sufficient income to provide financial stability so he can pay for an excellent university education for his children and give his family a better standard of

Hace un tiempo regres\u00f3 al pa\u00eds y con algunos ahorros pudo comprar su casa propia en un primer piso, con el objetivo de montar otro negocio que le ayudara a solventar las necesidades de su hogar.

He has been working independently since he was 24 years old.  With his brother\u2019s support he established a bakery and gained knowledge about this work, thanks to the baker with whom he used to work.  This business lasted for ten years.  Then he had the opportunity to relocate abroad for some years.\r\n\r\nSome time ago he returned to the country, and with some savings he was able to buy his own house on the first floor.  His objective for doing so was to establish another business, which would help him pay for the household necessities.  \r\n\r\nIn May of 2012 he opened a grocery story.  He was taking advantage of the fact that the area where he lives is showing urban growth.  So far it has given him good results.  His wife helps him manage it.  Hildebrando is an enterprising, vigorous, and responsible man who devotes himself to his family and his work.\r\n\r\nHe is always looking for new options to help him get ahead, and he has found support through various loans that he has received in the past.  He is now requesting his sixth loan cycle.  He will do this in order to buy fixed goods (display case) and to buy stock (hygiene products, cold meats, dairy products, pastries, cookies, and other basic needs products) wholesale.  This will give his business a better image, it will attract more customers, and he will have a greater quantity of inventory available to satisfy the needs and preferences of all of his customers.  That will be reflected in the increase in sales and revenue.\r\n\r\nHildebrando dreams of making his business grow and become a supermarket in which he will be able to offer employment opportunities.  This will generate enough resources to provide his children with an excellent university education so that they will have a promising and successful future.  He will also be able to enjoy a better quality of life alongside his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1412955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

For several years the slate has deteriorated, and after heavy rain the roof started leaking. Currently Marifat would like to carry out repairs. \r\n\r\nMarifat very much hopes that she can repair the roof before the winter, but the money she has saved up is not sufficient. To purchase new slate and repair the roof she needs more money.

Estas actividades le han generado los ingresos necesarios para el sostenimiento de su hogar, pues toda la carga econ\u00f3mica recae sobre ella, debido a que el padre de su hija nunca le ha colaborado econ\u00f3micamente. Ella elabora todo tipo de prendas pero en especial trabaja con tejido de punto. Julia es una mujer luchadora, pujante, activa y dedicada a su familia y a su labor, poco a poco ha ido invirtiendo dinero en su negocio para hacerlo crecer. Su \u00faltima adquisici\u00f3n fue una m\u00e1quina recubridora, la cual ocupa mucho espacio y por lo tanto el lugar donde tiene su taller ya est\u00e1 muy estrecho. Por esta raz\u00f3n se motiva a solicitar el apoyo del cr\u00e9dito, pues desea realizar unas adecuaciones locativas, para lo cual debe tumbar una pared y poner un ventanal, con el fin de aprovechar al m\u00e1ximo la luz natural y trabajar con mayor comodidad.

She has a 24-year-old daughter and recently became a grandmother. All of her working life, she has been a seamstress. Many years ago, she started her own tailoring workshop and she currently does sewing for third parties, tailors clothing, and also provides photocopying services and reloads credit on cell phones.\r\n\r\nThese activities provide her with the income necessary to sustain her home since all of the economic responsibilities fall on her because the father of her daughter never contributed economically.\r\n\r\nShe makes all types of garments, but her specialty is knitting. \r\n\r\nJulia is a persistent, thriving, active woman who is dedicated to her family and to her work. Little by little, she has been investing money in her business to make it grow. Her last acquisition was a coverstitch sewing machine, which occupies a lot of space and, due to this, her workshop is very tight. For this reason, she requests the support of a loan, since she hopes to make some adaptations to her workshop by demolishing a wall and installing a large window. Her goal is to use natural light to its full potential and be able to work comfortably. This will result in a shorter production time and will allow her to return the pending orders in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nJulia dreams of her business surviving for a long time but, in the mean time, she would like to implement the production of her own line of lingerie, sportswear, and home goods. This would allow her to offer more employment opportunities to women who are the heads of their households and will also allow her to improve her living conditions so that her granddaughter can have a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1412974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to make adaptations to her workshop by demolishing a wall and installing a large window.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-19T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-18T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia In\u00e9s ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":107278},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110215},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":113232},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":116332},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":119517},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":122789},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":126150},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":129604},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":133152},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":136798},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":140543},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144390}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.02},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.18,"local_amount":112831,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T09:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":115027.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822385},{"amount":130.8,"local_amount":245254,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":250028.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807397},{"amount":60.19,"local_amount":112858,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":115054.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074547},{"amount":548.83,"local_amount":1029057,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1049089.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009740}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T03:21:02Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meghan Rishel","image":1056096}},{"id":595088,"name":"11.01.03 Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Thi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ho\u00e0n has a retail business selling porcelain products\u00a0(e.g., bowls,\u00a0plates, cups).

Since childhood he helped his parents with livestock breeding and farming, as the people in the village mainly worked with these businesses, and so did his parents. \r\n\r\nUchkun is 34 years old. He is married and raising five children. He has worked with cultivation of crops himself for more than 12 years, growing potatoes, wheat, carrots etc. He sells the harvest at the market. As he has a high quality harvest, his goods are in large demand. His wife helps him with managing the business. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to provide the family with all necessary resources, he would like to develop his business. To do this, he needs a larger harvest.

He graduated from medical college in 2007 and since that he has been working as a dental technician in a private pharmacy. His wife has the same profession but is currently unemployed and stays at home. He is requesting a loan of 6,800,000 Mongolian t\u00f6gr\u00f6g (MNT) to purchase building materials such as bricks, cements, grindstone and sand in order to build a house foundation and walls. As winter is approaching, he is preparing to build a house which is far better than traditional Mongolian ger in both preserving warmth and living comfort. Also moving from a ger to a house has economic and environmental advantages because reduction in loss of heat results in less use and purchase of coal. The burning coal is the main source of air pollution in Mongolia. The borrower is very hardworking individual who strives for a better future together with his wife.

She is married to Esmeraldo, a pensioner and they have children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nFelicidad operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines.  While waiting for their local dump trucks people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, factories, and other similar places. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors.\r\n\r\nFelicidad dreams that her business will expand and hopes that her family will always be in good health. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week.  She can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1409571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Waste

primary source of income for rural residents.  Many people, like Sobirjon, are involved in farming and earn an income for living.  Sobirjon has been involved in growing agricultural crops, such as potatoes, wheat, etc., for over 15 years.  He has a quite good experience and develops his business year-after-year.  Sobirjon is married and has two children.  The children still do not have a regular source of income.  Sobirjon is the primary provider for the family.  Farming, particularly growing potatoes, carrots, wheat, is not only a source of income for him, but also a favorite occupation.  He works with satisfaction on the field from early morning until late evening.
