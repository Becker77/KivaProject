In order to support her partner in contributing to the household income, she decided to initiate a catalog sales business and make jewelry because of the lack of job opportunities and difficult economic times; she learned these activities empirically, by way of observation. Diana is a hard-working, judicious, active woman dedicated to her family and her work. They are the reason she is requesting a loan, which she will invest in the purchase of supplies (stones, chains, brooches, ribbons) and wholesale merchandise (body lotions, cosmetics, personal hygiene products). With this, she will be able to continue both businesses as she'll have supplies available to make and sell accessories and she'll also have a diverse inventory of merchandise to offer her clients to satisfy the tastes and needs of each one.

","en":"Behzod is a very kind and hard-working young man. He is 22 and lives with his parents. Because of disagreements in the family, his mother was often ill. He dreamed of becoming a doctor and curing his beloved mother. His father tried to keep his sons from receiving a good education. In spite of the hard times, Behzod graduated from high school with excellent grades and entered medical school. His dream came true, but he needs to pay for his studies and has no savings at home.

Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and for the family's personal, household, and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nRosalina would like to apply for another loan, this time for 51,000 PHP, to again buy supplies such as glass, stainless steel materials, silicon, and other materials for her business. Her business profits will definitely help her to meet both her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRosalina hopes to have a stockroom for all the supplies that she is buying for her business. She meets faithfully with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She has two children, who are still underage and thus live with her. She has only two years of primary school, but she fights every day, side-by-side with her partner, in order to give her children a better life than hers. She aims to support them in all she cans so that they want for nothing. Debora's speciality is coffee crops, having been a farmer for many years. She is very experienced with many crops, among them coffee, sweetcorn, and broad beans. The land the couple tills belongs to them, and was bought by the sweat of their brow, after saving and making sacrifices for many years. They wanted to own the land, as renting it would have offered next to no hope of carving out a better life for their family. Their house is located on this property, since they are the only ones who work at the farm. Debora's dream is her goal of giving her children a good education, which she thinks of as the key to a better future and to success in life. She fights day after day for this goal and thus asked field partner COMIXMUL for a loan in order to buy coffee-plant fertiliser, coffee-plant growing mixture, 18-46-0 fertiliser, and urea, which will enable her to tend to her coffee crops and profit from the expected plentiful harvest, since her business is her family's only source of income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1412196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy the supplies she needs to tend to her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-20T09:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-19T09:50:01Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1250,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25503.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812919}],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T14:13:30Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:27:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":595222,"name":"Tamam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tamam is a 44-year-old married mother of five children.

Her life partner works as a day labourer at a farm, milking cows twice a day. Their two children live with them and their son who is 19 works with his father as a day labourer. When he finished his basic education it was very difficult for him to carry on studying because the secondary schools are a long way away. He would have to travel to the city every day and the transport is irregular, with only one bus a day from the place where they live. Their younger daughter is studying in fourth grade at the community school which is 2 blocks from their house.\r\n\r\nNorma's current work is looking after an elderly lady in the city every other night from 5pm to 6am. She has been doing this type of work or working as a domestic help in the city for several years. She has to travel 10km to work and the transport is irregular with only one bus a day passing through the community and if they are not on time they have to travel by \"pick-up\".\r\n\r\nPreviously Norma worked at home on small business activities with her mum. They used to make chicken tamales to sell in their community and also worked in agriculture and looking after farm animals (pigs, chickens and cattle) at their home. When the family's expenses became greater, Norma had to look for other forms of income and through references from friends and family she was able to find work as a domestic help in the city.\r\n\r\nNorma will use the loan to buy building materials to begin building her house, since the family are currently living in a house of her mother's. She used a first loan she was given to buy bricks for the walls, but now they want to start building their own house on a piece of land which her mother left her.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to finish the house one day so they can live more comfortably and to have farmyard animals without affecting anyone else.

Her income from her business assisted her in sending her child to school and also in their everyday expenses. She also has a vending karaoke machine and she also sells rice. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 51,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her child\u2019s education expense.

His mum worked as a domestic help and his dad works as a construction foreman, in agricultural work and as a dairyman. This is how Jos\u00e9 learnt bricklaying and milk processing,  specialising in \"quesillo\" [soft cheese]. He also has a little experience in fattening cattle.\r\n\r\nIn general Jos\u00e9 works in his community and its outskirts, from 7am until 4pm. When he was working as a bricklayer with his dad 7 years ago, he met the girl who is now his life partner and he moved out of his home to live with her. His partner just does housework in her own house and they have an 8-month old baby girl.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 only studied basic education before he met his partner and after that he was not able to carry on with his schooling. He now works independently as a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is to buy grazing cattle, since Jos\u00e9 already has a piece of land which he is renting for grazing cattle near to the house he lives in. This  may become something which gives him some additional income for himself and his family in the short term. For this he says he will work a bit harder and get up earlier to take the cattle to the pasture before going to work, bringing them back to the pen in the afternoon and giving them water.

The milk that is produced is sold to relatives, friends, and neighbors in the town where he resides.  He learned this trade by accompanying a friend who milks cows on a farm.  This business enables Jos\u00e9 to earn more income for covering basic necessities.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe is an enterprising, active, and dynamic client who is always looking for new opportunities to get ahead.  For this reason, Jos\u00e9 is requesting support for advancing his business.  The money will be invested in the purchase of cattle (a dairy cow) so that he can increase production and satisfy the demand for his product.  As a result his earnings will improve.  \r\n<p>\r\nJos\u00e9 dreams of becoming totally independent and having a well-established farming business that is profitable and financially solvent.  As a result, his living conditions will improve and he will be able to enjoy a better quality of life with his son.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1412497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow.

Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the vulnerable poor. These people do not have access to credit products, as they're regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income. With this loan, Dodo will purchase all the building materials for the greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built properly, Dodo will grow greens and various types of vegetables. The harvested products will be sold for a good price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income and improve the family's living

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He says his main challenge is too little capital and long droughts that cause hoof and mouth disease, along  with low sales  during the dry spells.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1410029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Veterinary Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy veterinary drugs to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-08-20T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-19T21:10:04Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":302040.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880157},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":302040.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983818},{"amount":150.6,"local_amount":384500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":387114.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863349},{"amount":7.83,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":20136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752427},{"amount":194.07,"local_amount":495500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":498869.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233418},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":302040.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468058923},{"amount":8,"local_amount":20424,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":20562.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479276799},{"amount":200.86,"local_amount":512826,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":516313.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504414536},{"amount":261.14,"local_amount":666750,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":671283.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517693005}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T00:50:41Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T17:57:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":595480,"name":"Fatmata Binta's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured here are teachers of a primary school located in Bo, a city in southern Sierra Leone.

As a little girl growing up, Heather remembers sitting on the couch with her mother every night watching movies starring lead female roles like Hepburn and Monroe. Inspired by these women, Heather set out to discover what made these women so strong.\r\n\r\nShortly after graduating college, Heather realized that she would never be satisfied working for other people so instead she followed her entrepreneurial spirit and decided to do what she loves in order to make a living. Starting off by just word of mouth, Heather was able to create some buzz and pull in clientele for her brand new custom clothing businesses. Rather than opening a retail store, Heather knew that she wanted to make customized clothes so that her customers could see their outfits from start to finish. \"It's a great experience when you know who made the clothes, and then there's truly a story with it,\" says Heather.\r\n\r\nBy starting this business Heather hopes to empower women through fashion in her community and with this loan of $10,000, Heather will be allowed to produce a small ready-to-wear collection for her online store as well as doing marketing.

His main plantation comprises diverse varieties of plantain, those that are in high demand in his region. His products are sold to wholesale merchants in the city markets. He's been running his business for 20 years and remembers how much work and effort it took to establish it. He used to sow papaya, but a plague arrived and destroyed his investment. However, he soldiered on and began sowing a different crop. He works with the help of his wife and on some occasions he contracts the services of other workers. Fortunately, it's going well for him; his crops are harvested frequently because he established different sowing times and now he has variation in his production stage. On this occasion he is requesting 2,000 soles. He's very happy to know that he'll have financial support and as such feels secure that he can move his business forward. He promises to make punctual payments. With the loan requested, he will buy organic manure for his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1414054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"buy

She has a child who is studying and her income from business is helping to support her child's educational needs. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another loan, in the amount of PHP 15,000, for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in greater profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her child\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nKatlyn hopes that her variety store will become a grocery store someday and she dreams to give her child a good life and a future. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business. She also draws strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1342779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries, and beverages to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-08-20T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-19T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3066.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784568},{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4088.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771554},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5111.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824596},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3066.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478423}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T01:08:43Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:51:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":595611,"name":"Ly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ly is 37 years old and a married woman with two children.

For this cause, she is requesting a loan of MNT 4,000,000 to purchase building and insulation materials, such as bricks, cement, fiberglass, and foam. Using those materials, Sarantuul, together with her elder son, will repair and insulate their house. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal for heating and emit less smoke into the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nAccording to a national research department, almost all the air pollution results from extensive burning of coal, so that measurements to reduce coal usage are taking place around the city by encouraging people to insulate their houses with high quality materials.

On the average, they are 31 years old, with five children. They all live in the Sabalibougou neighborhood in the Bamako district. They know each other as neighbors and fellow vendors at the Sabalibougou markets. The group members sell various types of clothing: traditional colorful fabric (wax \u201cpagnes\u201d, embroidered \u201cpagnes,\u201d and damask-type \u201cbazins\u201d) as well as second-hand clothing. With the goal of bolstering their working capital, the group members have decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their first solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fati (the only one standing in the photo) is well known as a vendor of high-quality traditional fabric. She plans to use her loan to buy four sets of the \u201cbazin\u201d type fabric in Bamako.
