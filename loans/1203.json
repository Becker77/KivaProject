She is a mother to five children and works in farming as well as being a housewife.  Cristina completed only up to the end of second grade in primary school as her parents did not have the money to support her and there were not enough schools near her town.  Of Cristina's five children, only three still live in the same community and only two are still dependent on their parents.  One of the children only studied up to the end of school and the youngest, 17-years-old, is studying an open learning degree course.  Cristina has a lot of experience working in the field as, alongside her husband, she puts in a lot of effort to keep her coffee crops clean.  In addition the couple grows corn and beans.  Their land is about five minutes from their home.  Come harvest all the family helps to cut and collect the coffee.  Cristina's products are purchased by people from a nearby community.  These people work exclusively buying and selling coffee.\r\n\r\nCristina is applying for a loan from \"Comixmul\" as it will help her to buy the necessary supplies to improve her business.  These supplies include manure and fertiliser and will give Cristina high quality products and she will have better sales and, consequently, a higher income for her family.\r\n\r\nCristina's goal is to see her daughter achieve her dream of graduating from university.

She has had ties to it for sixty months after having had three solidarity loans and six individual loans, all paid back. She is now on her seventh individual loan, which she will use to purchase 5 bales of secondhand clothing. She gets her supplies from Bamako and sometimes locally.\r\n\r\nShe accepts cash or credit from a mixed customer base.

She lives in a traditional family with her husband, her children, and the children of a deceased co-wife in the district of Bagadadji in S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nNansa never attended school due to social reasons (her parents were illiterate). Therefore, she learned the trade of commerce alongside her mother who was selling clothing. After 15 years of activity together, and enriched by this experience, Nansa started her own income-generating activities such as the sale of clothing, shoes, and bed sheets, as well as the preparation and sale of fruit juices, an activity she has been practicing for 15 years and for which she enjoys a large customer base. Her sales strength resides in the quality of her juice, which she prepares carefully and sells in clean containers bearing her name. \r\n\r\nTo bolster her working capital and meet customer demand, she joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso 2 years ago, and has already obtained and repaid 2 individual loans. This is her 3rd loan cycle with the MFI, and she plans to use the credit to buy 5 bags of sugar and 5 cartons of powdered juice. She buys her stock locally and sells her product for cash and on credit to a mixed clientele of all ages. \r\n\r\nShe expects to earn a monthly profit of 90,000 FCFA that she will use to repay her loan, to support herself and to take care of her late co-wife\u2019s children. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to open a general food store in the area.

She completed her primary education, but her parents also taught her how to work the land, which is how she and her family earn a living. Her oldest child is nine years old and he is studying his fourth year of primary education. Her middle child is five years old, and she is in preschool in the same community. Her youngest child, a boy, is two years old. Emelina\u2019s principal and only source of income for her family is growing coffee, corn and beans. She helps her husband with the crops, while also looking after the household work. They own the fields where they grow their crops, and these are located near their home. Emelina and her husband harvest and gather the crops, as their children are still too young to be able to help them. They sell their coffee beans to intermediaries who buy and sell coffee.\r\n\r\nEmelina is requesting this loan to buy agricultural supplies, such as coffee seedlings and fertilizer. She will also use part of the loan to prepare the fields where they will plant the coffee seedlings.\r\n\r\nEmelina\u2019s goal is to achieve the harvest she is hoping for, and to continue increasing the amount of land she has under cultivation so that her children will have a good inheritance. Her greatest wish is to see her three children graduate from university, so that in the future they can look after themselves. She would like to see the achievements of her children, because she and her husband were unable to finish their studies due to a lack of resources."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1414683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy coffee seedlings and fertilizer, and to prepare the land for growing coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-21T16:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-20T16:20:06Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":15292.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082621}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T19:07:51Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":595787,"name":"Filomena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filomena is taking out a loan of $1,000 to improve her business.

Her dream was to be a doctor who was good at her work. She wanted to specialize in pediatrics since she has always liked children. With the passage of time, Cristina wanted to be many things: psychologist, professor, lawyer, and even a flight attendant. But despite all these career choices, she never forgot her dream of being a doctor.\r\n\r\nIn the final year of her baccalaureate, Cristina couldn't decide what to do since shortly, she would leave that epoch of friends, diversions, and daring which she enjoyed so much to enter the real world where one has to struggle to achieve better things. After graduating, Cristina began to think about what she should study but in this period, she had forgotten her dream, because many people told her that for this career she needed more than simply the will.\r\n\r\nWith these simple words, Cristina abandoned her dream and began looking for other careers to study. One day she spoke with her brother and he asked her what had become of her dream, since he recalled that from an early age, Cristina had played at being a doctor with her dolls. She responded that due to life's conditions, that is money, she couldn't study medicine, although she would have given everything to do so.\r\n\r\nCristina's brother said that Cristina shouldn't abandon her dream entirely, that she should study to be a nursing assistant. She accepted the idea and began to study to be a nursing assistant. After a semester she was excited to begin working in a hospital as an assistant, enabling her to pay to enroll in the superior nursing program and upon finishing this, she could better afford her career in medicine and specialize in pediatrics.\r\n\r\nWhat Cristina likes most about nursing is learning to administer medicines, channel her assistance, take blood, cure wounds, and other things she has learned that an assistant must do. None of these tasks cause her revulsion because she knows that by doing all this, she will become a grand doctor.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Cristina, an adolescent who from her childhood, wished to be a doctor and who little by little and with effort and dedication, is achieving the dream of becoming the best pediatric doctor, and of advancing her family and making them proud of her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1414699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to study towards her pediatric medical degree.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-21T16:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-20T16:20:06Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina  Yineth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":770000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":210000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":154.55,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":296660.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780602},{"amount":40.29,"local_amount":73000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":77343.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539977},{"amount":75.61,"local_amount":137000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-14T10:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":145151.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752505},{"amount":78.93,"local_amount":143000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-29T09:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":151508.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845811},{"amount":75.62,"local_amount":137000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":145151.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439696779}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T17:25:32Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":598052,"name":"Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Teresa tiene 59 A\u00f1os de edad es agricultora y madre de familia la cual est\u00e1 compuesta por 11 hijos con un grado de educaci\u00f3n cursado hasta el sexto grado ya que sus padres no ten\u00edan la capacidad para darle la oportunidad para que estudiara hasta la universidad y era muy dif\u00edcil el hecho de estudiar ya que no hab\u00edan los suficientes centros de educaci\u00f3n para poder asistir.

She was not able to go any further in school because her parents didn't have the resources to send her to university and it would have been very difficult to continue in school anyway because there were not enough schools located near enough to attend. Of her 11 children, 5 still live with her, one is studying psychology at university, two one finished required schooling and they stay at home to help their parents in the fields and the two youngest are in their last year of secondary school. The source of their income is their cultivation of coffee, something that she learned from her parents and then continued with her spouse. They have already collected the seeds and they are ready to sell to the middle men who specialize in the buying and selling of coffee in their area. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan from the cooperative COMIXMUL, which will help her to purchase fertilizer and various specialty products that she will use to plant more productive harvests and attract more clientele. \r\n\r\nMs. Teresa wants to improve their business in the future and be able to give a better inheritance to their children, as well as give them a bit of land that they will be able to use in the future if they run into any financial problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1414705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"purchase supplies to help with her coffee crop.

The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Monica who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans. \r\n\r\nMonica is requesting a 3,000,000 UGX loan from BRAC Uganda to buy more garments to sell and help expand her business. She will use the profit from her loan to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children and provide for other family needs. Monica hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1410698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Masindi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-08-21T17:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-20T17:30:16Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":204143},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":211516},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":219156},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":227072},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":235273},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":243771},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":252576},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":261699},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":271151},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":280945},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":291092},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":301606}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.8,"local_amount":415659,"processed_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-28T08:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":416762.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411561044},{"amount":85.84,"local_amount":219156,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":219737.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420923940},{"amount":88.93,"local_amount":227072,"processed_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":227674.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429470552},{"amount":92.15,"local_amount":235273,"processed_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T09:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":235897.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440156040},{"amount":95.48,"local_amount":243771,"processed_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":244417.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449600714},{"amount":201.42,"local_amount":514275,"processed_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":515639.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467879050},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":271151,"processed_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":271870.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479102369},{"amount":224.05,"local_amount":572037,"processed_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":573555.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504219405},{"amount":118.13,"local_amount":301606,"processed_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-24T09:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":302406.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519782942}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T16:20:46Z","paid_date":"2014-08-24T09:02:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":598062,"name":"Teodosia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teodosia, de 45 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y tiene 3 hijos con quienes vive en su casa propia.

Their aim is to embrace renewable energy that will help them improve their lives by saving money and time and improving their families' health. The five women are all teachers at a rural school, and they have been using a big portion of their salary to buy fuel. They use charcoal and LPG gas for cooking and also buy kerosene and candles for lighting, as their homes are not connected to the electricity grid.\n\nJane, the eldest among them, sitted at the middle in the photo, has lived in this village for the last 11 years and has suffered the effects of  using kerosene.  Three years ago one of her children accidentally hit a kerosene lantern, sending their house into flames and leaving them homeless. She was not aware that there was an alternative to kerosene, however, so she continued using it. Only recently did she meet the VEP sales team at a community training and learned about solar lamps, which caught her interest. She also  confesses that the poor lighting levels from kerosene lamps has for years made it difficult for her children and those of her neighbors to study, affecting their performance in school. With solar lighting she hopes this will change and they will get better grades.\n\nThese women are taking a loan to purchase a solar home package that will enable each of them to light up to four rooms, charge mobile phones, and use a small radio.  Together with her group mates they will spread the benefits of using solar and transform their dark village into a bright one.

Santiago vive con su esposa e hijo en el Cant\u00f3n de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. Tambi\u00e9n es una ciudad ideal para actividades de comercio por el paso de turistas en la ciudad y las necesidades de sus habitantes. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nSantiago al vivir la dura experiencia de la falta de oportunidades laborales en su ciudad y a\u00fan en las ciudades aleda\u00f1as, decidi\u00f3 emprender su propio negocio hace un par de a\u00f1os, aplicando los conocimientos de administraci\u00f3n que obtuvo en su formaci\u00f3n acad\u00e9mica. Invierte por lo menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en su Centro de C\u00f3mputo en donde acuden estudiantes de escuelas, colegios, universitarios, ejecutivos e inclusive familias a hacer uso del servicio de internet, c\u00e1mara web y de los programas computacionales. A veces el tiempo invertido se prolonga por el mantenimiento minucioso que debe hacer a los equipos. A medida que Santiago ha incrementado los servicios y ha trabajado en mejorar cada d\u00eda la atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes, la demanda ha crecido y muchas veces personas esperan para poder tener acceso a un computador, por esta raz\u00f3n, este hombre emprendedor solicita un cr\u00e9dito con el cual comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s computadoras que las ubicar\u00e1 en el espacio disponible que le queda en el local, de esta forma podr\u00e1 atender a todas las personas que llegan en busca de los servicios que se presta en su local y as\u00ed incrementar sus ingresos que le ayuden a brindar a su familia un estilo de vida de calidad y un d\u00eda poder cumplir su sue\u00f1o de tener su casa propia. ","en":"Santiago, age 30, is a young husband and father.  He had the chance to get a higher education.  Nevertheless, it was not easy to find employment.  He is married to Eliana, age 26, and they have one child who is just one year old.  They got married when they were very young, and they have had to work very hard to pay for the family\u2019s necessities.\r\n\r\nSantiago lives with his wife and child in the Salcedo canton, which is in the eastern part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces in the Ecuadorian mountains.  There are various tourist attractions like lakes and spas in Salcedo.  They offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists.  However, the main business activity in this town is farming and, to a lesser extent, livestock.  It is also an ideal city for commerce because of the tourists that pass through the city and the inhabitants\u2019 necessities.  In spite of these productive activities, there are very worrisome indicators of illiteracy and poverty because basic needs are not met.  An example is the sewer service that only 25% have in their homes.\r\n\r\nUpon living the difficult experience of the lack of work opportunities in his city, and even in surrounding cities, Santiago decided to undertake his own business two years ago.  He applies the knowledge of administration that he got when going to school.  He spends at least eight hours each day at his Computer Center.  This is where students from elementary school, high school, universities, and executives, including families, go to make use of internet service, web camera, and computer programs.

Obtaining a higher profit margin and improving her family's earnings is her principal objective. \r\n\r\nJeimy and her husband are in the process of expanding their new business. They have invested much of their money and assets into it. With an established stock of merchandise, they sell their clothes at the weekly festivals in Grecia as well as in different stores in the region. From this they earn enough money to make their repayments for this loan. Jeimy's goal is to produce clothing and sell it directly so that she earns more profits from her merchandise and achieve growth that leads to consolidation. Jeimy and her husband each have much experience in dressmaking. They started their family business with their own capital and they already have equipment and machinery that allows them to produce quality products for their clients.

She works at a dekhan farm and is additionally involved in growing agricultural crops.  Her husband and two sons work in Russia.  And her daughter also goes to Russia in the summer to help her brothers.  Manzura's children grew up and now need to get their own families, but a lot of expenses are involved in this, and this is why the children try to help their mother and earn money.  After a discussion with her husband and children, Manzura decided to request a loan from the Arvand organization.

Lailo and her sisters help their mother with the farm work: from planting to harvesting.  \n\nLailo is a very hardworking and energetic young woman who would like to start her own business.  She is thinking of buying and selling livestock, as she has all the conditions required to run such a business: there is a small barn in the house's courtyard to keep some livestock, and she could use a portion of the family's farming production to feed her livestock.  \n\nLailo's starting capital amounts to 500 USD.  She is requesting a loan as additional capital, to buy four young bulls and start her own business.\n\nLailo says that her mother will help her run this business.

Azizhon came to our organization to make his dream come true.  He has a land plot and wants to install a greenhouse there to grow ecologically clean products, such as fresh cucumbers, tomatoes and greens.  His grandfather, who has many years of experience, advises him in this endeavor.  Azizhon's parents also support him.  In the future, Azizhon wants to expand his selection and grow vegetables with the help of biological minerals, fertilizers and heat the greenhouse with the help of biogas.  Azizhon came to Arvand to obtain a loan.  He plans to purchase mineral fertilizers for his greenhouse.

His vision is to start a solar product business and even own a shop to sell products to people in rural areas. Only about 4% of the population in rural Tanzania has access to electricity and the national grid. Therefore, providing solar products has a great impact on people\u2019s lives and may contribute to empower the population in rural areas. For instance, businesses may extend their shop hours, people can offer mobile phone charging stations, or children can study for school after nightfall.\n\nDue to his former occupation as an electrical technician, he has a lot of connections in the energy sector as well as technical knowledge. This will help a great deal when setting up a business.\n\nHe is convinced that he can sell 10 products per day! Thus, he is eager to get access to a loan. Among other expenses, this loan will be used to purchase solar inventory, rent a shop space, and buy a motorbike in order to provide after-sales service to the

Sobirjon's wife works as a seamstress, and mother as a salesperson at a market.  Sobirjon wants to get involved in a profitable business that would bring him a stable income.  He is interested in buying and selling cattle.  He saved some money and is adding the rest from this loan in order to buy two cows.  Sobirjon plans to buy, fatten the cows for 60 days and then resell them at the livestock market, located not far from his house.  This way he would not have any transportation expenses selling livestock.  In addition, Sobirjon has a cowshed in the yard of his house for keeping livestock and has 100 haystacks.  He needs support in order to start this business."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1409717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy two cows to start his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":2950,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sobirjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2936,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":102.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":107.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":112.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":127.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.6},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":136.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":139.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":145.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":154.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.07},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":595945,"name":"Melanie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melanie is 58 years old and married.\r\n\r\nMelanie works hard to provide for her family.

He wants to start a bakery and a confectionery, but his loan request has always been rejected in the past because of his lack of experience, which is usually required by local credit providers. Gela has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to vulnerable poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n \r\nWith his credit, Gela will start up his own confectionery shop. He has already rented a store with all of the needed equipment, and he needs money to purchase raw materials for baking cookies and cakes. Gela will hire a confectioner, and his wife will help him running the business as well. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1410848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start up a confectionery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Rustavi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T01:40:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gela ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.57,"local_amount":118.57,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":118.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134337},{"amount":139.02,"local_amount":139.02,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":139.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107918},{"amount":141.46,"local_amount":141.46,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":141.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255452},{"amount":146.03,"local_amount":146.03,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":146.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019582},{"amount":148.88,"local_amount":148.88,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":148.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670689},{"amount":152.73,"local_amount":152.73,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":152.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141315},{"amount":158.3,"local_amount":158.3,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":158.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467957047},{"amount":160.76,"local_amount":160.76,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-24T08:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":160.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479177778},{"amount":165.19,"local_amount":165.19,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-30T08:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":165.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490872368},{"amount":169.06,"local_amount":169.06,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":169.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504299514}],"funded_date":"2013-08-24T19:11:32Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:22:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":595937,"name":"Isatu A.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 53-year-old Isatu A.

Her daughter helps her with the housework while her son helps his father in the workshop.  For the past 10 years, she has worked in agriculture, a skill she learned thanks to her parents who taught her this productive activity.  She remembers going all the way to her father's corn plantation where she loved to help him work.  \r\n\r\nThe land where they grow is 2km from their home, and she makes the trip on foot.  Her work schedule is from 6am to 11:30am.  The loan will be used to purchase seed, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides to use for prevention in case there is a plague, and to cultivate 7,000 square meters of corn.  This will allow her to plant, and ensure that she has the amount of corn she will need for the rest of the year and the beginning of next year, and be able to sell what is left.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve her home and help her husband grow his business.

escuela primaria. Est\u00e1 casado con Blanca de 40 a\u00f1os, se casaron siendo muy j\u00f3venes y han trabajado de forma independiente y sacrificada para sacar adelante su hogar. Tienen un hijo de 15 a\u00f1os Byron que se encuentra estudiando en un colegio p\u00fablico y a quien Segundo espera verlo convertido en un profesional de excelencia. Viven en Ecuador en el pueblito de Salcedo lugar donde la principal actividad que desarrollan es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares, a pesar de este obst\u00e1culo sus habitantes luchan por salir adelante.\nSegundo se dedica a la crianza de pollos, actividad que hered\u00f3 de sus padres y abuelos, y en la cual invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda, y un poco m\u00e1s en los d\u00edas de feria cuando sale a comercializar sus animales. Este negocio ha funcionado durante 30 a\u00f1os y la falta de capital ha sido un impedimento para el crecimiento, sin embargo las ganancias que ha obtenido del mismo han servido para abastecer la demanda de sus clientes y el mercado. Ahora Segundo solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayudar\u00e1 a comprar animales de crianza y tambi\u00e9n alimento al por mayor, de esta forma obtendr\u00e1 un ahorro y por ende mayores ingresos que le ayudar\u00e1n a cubrir los gastos de educaci\u00f3n de su hijo y adem\u00e1s ofrecer a su familia un mejor estilo de vida. Segundo agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por la confianza que han depositado en \u00e9l para que pueda ser parte del crecimiento de la econom\u00eda de su pa\u00eds. ","en":"Segundo is a 57 year-old man who grew up in the country and has only a limited elementary education.  He is married to Blanca, who is 40 years old.  They married when they were very young, and they've worked independently and sacrificed to provide for their family.  They have a 15 year-old son, Byron, who attends a public school, whom Segundo hopes to see become an excellent professional.  They live in Ecuador, in the little town of Salcedo.  This is a place where the main economic activity is agriculture, followed by livestock production.  The nice weather that this canton enjoys also makes it a very suitable place for raising livestock.  In spite of all of these productive activities there are worrisome rates of illiteracy and poverty, and there are unmet basic needs, such as sewer service, which only 25 percent of households have.  In spite of all of these obstacles, the residents here strive to get ahead.\r\n\r\nSegundo has a business raising chickens, which he inherited from his parents and grandparents.  He spends 8 hours a day working in this activity, and a little more on the market days when he goes out to sell his animals.  This business has operated for 30 years, and a lack of capital has been an impediment to its growth.  However, the earnings that he has obtained from the business have enabled him to meet the demand of his customers and of the market.  At this time, Segundo is requesting a loan that will help him to buy animals to raise, and also to buy animal feed at wholesale.  In this way he will obtain savings and thereby increase his income, which will help him to cover the educational expenses for his son and also offer his family a better quality of life.  Segundo thanks the Fundacion Alternativa for the trust they have placed in him so that he can contribute to the growth of his nation's economy.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1414807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He has been working as a farmer all his life, in the employ of various farms in his areas. Four years ago, building on the experience acquired during those jobs, he decided to start his own business, namely the raising and fattening of pigs to sell. His goal is to earn an independent income, and he has succeeded to pay for basic household expenses since he started. Arley is full of enterprising spirit: he works long hours every day and is always looking for the best way to overcome obstacles, since setbacks can be caused by external factors wholly out of his control, one example being the fluctuations in meat prices. This is why Arley asks for his third loan with the field partner. He will use the funds to buy piglets to fatten, as well as supplies such as vitamins and feed. This will enable him to increase his production and to have a better profit margin, that he will put towards improving his business and giving his family a better life. It will also get him closer to his dream, which is to raise piglets all year round, in order to have a more stable monthly income to improve his family's standard of living and give his children a better education."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1414899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy piglets to fatten, as well as supplies such as vitamins and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Santa Rosa de Osos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T08:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T08:40:03Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francy Arley ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":134713},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":138429},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":142248},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":146172},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":150205},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":154348},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":158606},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":162982},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167478},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":172098},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":176846},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":181725},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":186738},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":191889},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":197183},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":202623},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":208212},{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":213956},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":219859},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":225924},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":232157},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":238561},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":245142},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":251906}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.87},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.73},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.02},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":595994,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is a married woman with four children all of whom attend school.

After the death of her husband, Sarabubu did not have a long time to get over the loss of a loved one.  She had to raise her children to stand on their own two feet, so she decided to take the household and financial responsibilities into her own hands.  Sarabubu has a high school education.  Her neighbors see her as an enterprising and capable woman.  Her elder daughter works as a journalist and her son is a student.  Her daughter helps her mother make ends meet every month.  \r\n\r\nSarabubu raises livestock and grows crops, which have been the family's main source of income since 1994.  She started this business with 10,000 som (KGS), and thanks to her hard work, her farm now has two dairy cows, one bull, four sheep and she also has a .72 hectare plot of land on which she grows barley.  Her business bring her about 9,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and calves, which covers the basic costs of food and household needs for her family.  \r\n\r\nThe income from the farm has allowed Sarabubu to raise and provide for her children.  With the goal of developing her business further, Sarabubu has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy calves to raise and resell.  She plans to invest the income from this loan back into her farm, and also to pay for her son's future education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1410506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

\"hero-mother\" who is raising six children (two daughters and four sons).  Orizjon has a high school education, her husband is disabled and the children help her around the house.  Their family is big and friendly, and their family ties are very strong.  The two elder sons are migrant workers in Russia, and they help their parents by sending money home on a monthly basis.  The rest of the children are still in school and pre-school.\r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for the family, Orzijon has been involved in agriculture and raising livestock since 1990.  She started this business with 2,000 som (KGS) and thanks to her hard work, her farm now has one dairy cow and 13 sheep, as well as a .72 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes, sunflowers and corn.  Her farm brings in about 12,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and livestock, and it is enough to provide food and household items for the family.  The income from her farm has allowed Orzijon to improve her standard of living.  With the goal of developing her business further, Orzijon has turned to the microcredit bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy calves.  She plans to reinvest the income from the loan back into her farm, and she intends to make repairs on her home in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1410524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Shakhzada is 41 years old and is married with four children.  She has a high school education and her neighbors see her as an enterprising and hard-working woman.  Her husband and children actively help her around the house.  As the main source of income from her family, Shakhzada has been involved in agriculture and raising livestock since 1999.  She started this business with 6,000 som (KGS).  She has a lot of experience in breeding and raising livestock and also in working the land.  Thanks to her hard work, Shakhzada now has one dairy cow, two calves and seven sheep on her farm, as well as a two-hectare plot of land on which she grows corn, sunflowers and potatoes.  Her farm brings in about 15,000 som (KGS) per month, which is enough to pay for the food and household goods for her family.  Shakhzada is trying to increase her farm's income to help her family.  With the goal of developing her business further, she turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep to raise and resell.  Shakhzada plans to reinvest the income from this loan back into her farm, and she also has plans to make repairs on her home, where she lives with her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1410580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He has worked in agriculture from a young age, always working alongside his father and siblings. When he was 16 years old his father died and, being the oldest, Ismael took on responsibility for his other siblings, working on his own and other people's land. With a great deal of effort he worked with their oxen to provide the daily food for his family.\r\n\r\nWhen Ismael was 23 he got married but he still helped his mother out. During his marriage he had 6 children who all have families of their own now. Four of them work with him in agriculture, growing 28,000 square metres of corn together. Ismael lives with just his wife, as his family all have their own homes.\r\n\r\nThe land where he works is 1km from his home and he has to get up early every day to get through all the necessary cultivation tasks. Sometimes he works all day and even has to stay up all night, since there are some pests which come at night. He works the 28,000 square metres with his children. They do a smaller proportion of the work but they help him as he has provided them with land to work on.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy agricultural supplies (manure, fertilisers), to pay for farmhands and to prepare the land for cultivation. Ismael hopes to improve his corn crop and manage to produce a bigger harvest so he can have a better income for himself and his wife.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of hard work and determination he wants to build a better house and to save a small amount of money from the profits he makes in agriculture to buy cattle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1414902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies (manure, fertilisers), to pay for farmhands and to prepare the land for cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T13:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T13:10:09Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215555}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T11:48:31Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:12:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":596013,"name":"Pauline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pauline is 40 years old and a resident of Rubaga Road.

Due to the poverty of his parents, who were unable to send him to school, he only finished second grade.  He gets up each day at 5am to milk his cows, and afterwards he takes them to pasture, which is about 2 kilometers away. In the afternoon he goes to pick them up, gets them in the corral, and gives them water and a bit of hay. During the day he works cleaning, fertilizing and controlling the insects in his cornfield.\r\n\r\nIn order to purchase cows, he has to wait for a truck that takes people to the local market.

district, one of the poorest districts of India, stepped out and decided to build a secure future for their families with their contributions. They formed a group named Jay Maa Santoshi to access credit from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing business. \r\n\r\nManjula is the one standing on the extreme right with her hand raised in the photo. She is 35 years old and lives with her husband, two daughters of 22 and 16 years old and one son of 18 years of age, who help in her business. Manjula hails from a traditional cloth weaving community. For the last 10 years, she has been running a cloth weaving business with her husband. Now she has one hand loom for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader  20 km away from her village. They prepare 80 to 100 pieces from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. \r\n\r\nManjula does the initial processing of the yarn to make it ready for weaving and after that, her husband fits it to the hand loom and weaves the sari. They only weave saris because of the demand in the market. Her family works around 8-10 hours a day and weaves two pieces of sari from it. Manjula sells her products to the local traders on a weekly basis. She earns a monthly income of Rs.5000, which is not sufficient to maintain her family. \r\n\r\nWith the present loan, she wants to buy thread\/yarn in bulk which will cost around 15,000 INR. Purchasing more stock at a time will help her to reduce the purchasing and transportation costs of the raw materials. Manjula wishes to grow her business and save enough to construct a house and give a better education to her son. Hemabati, Chandrakanti and Jogeswari are the other three members of the group and they also have cloth weaving businesses and Tiffin centres."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1411121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing a bundle of yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"RISIGAON, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T15:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T15:10:06Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hemabati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrakanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manjula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jogeswari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T18:28:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":596149,"name":"Trishakti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the year 2010, four women from a rural village named Bharuakani of Balangir district in Odisha, India formed a group named Trishakti to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their business. Binakumari is one of these women. \r\n\r\nThe lady sitting second from right in the photo, raising her hand, is Binakumari, aged 44 who lives with her husband, two daughters of 12 and 9 years, one son of 6 years and her mother in-law. Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day. \r\n\r\nBinakumari has been running a general store in her house for the last eighteen years. She is also sells milk. Her husband supplements the income from her business. She sells general grocery items like sugar, lentils, biscuits, soap, shampoo, chocolate and stationery such as books, pens, etc. Binakumari was able to increase the variety of items at her general store with her scanty savings and increase her cash flow. Her monthly income from the existing business is Rs.4000\/-. Out of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses. As per her statement, she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. \r\n\r\nBinakumari wants to increase the stock of her business. So the loan amount will be utilized to purchase items like sugar, tea dust, lentils, biscuits, soap, shampoo, chocolate etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock less frequently from the nearest town, 15 kms away. Binakumari hopes to save enough to build a good house for her family as the present house is very small and congested. She also dreams of giving a better education to her children. The other three members of the group are  Dahana, Basanti and Jashobanti who are running a bamboo basket-making and selling business, a general store and a milk business respectively. \r\n\r\nSince the inception of Trishakti group, Binakumari has been heading the group with dedication and sincerity. Other members of the group are also very happy and satisfied under the dynamic leadership of Binakumari."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1411130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing sugar, tea dust, lentils, biscuits, soap, shampoo, chocolate etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BHARUAKANI, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T15:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T15:10:06Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binakumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dahana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jashobanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":52000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-23T23:00:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":598552,"name":"Rubiel \u00c1ngel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rubiel tiene 53 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposa y sus dos hijos.

She has 8 children, but only 7 are alive as one of her daughters died. Three of her children still live with her: one that's 24 who finished elementary school; the second one is 21 and graduated as an auto mechanic; and the last one finished elementary school. When Gloria's daughter died, she took in both of her daughter's children who are in grade 2. Gloria, her husband and family are farmers who grow corn and beans for consumption and to sell, but their biggest source of income is their coffee bean crop. The land is located approximately 15 minutes from her house, with no direct access to it they have to access it by way of their neighbor's land.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy 3 quintals of urea, 2550 new coffee plants, 3 quintals of formula 12-24-12 and 3 quintals of formula 18-26-0, with which she can protect, secure and strengthen her old crops and her new ones.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to rebuild her house, as it's in very bad shape, so she can give her children a dignified place to live. Her biggest goal is to continue growing her business by buying more land, which she thinks she can do with the income from her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1414913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy agricultural supplies for her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":238.06,"local_amount":4761.25,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4854.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504237140},{"amount":511.94,"local_amount":10238.75,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10438.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517523893}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T19:17:23Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:09:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":596248,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda is married, with six children.
