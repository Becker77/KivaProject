Luis' work consists of growing and selling plantains, yuca, and other regional produce. For a long time, he had economic problems and lacked the money his household required. That is why, some 6 years ago, he decided to begin a new project to help him get ahead. He believed that his friends, neighbors and relatives would like to buy produce from his fields in season. That's why he began his business. Also, he sells soft drinks of different flavors when he is at home.\r\n\r\nLuis likes what he does since it allows him time to care for his home. Since he started this business, his economic situation has been doing better. Now, he has 2 sources of income from his home and he wants to keep on growing. That is why he wishes to expand his sales.\r\n\r\nThis will be his 1st loan with Kiva. To accomplish that, he hopes for your collaboration so that he can continue toward his objectives. In addition, he promises to make his payments punctually. With the solicited 1,000 sols he will buy organic manure for his crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1415472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase organic manure for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Aucayacu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":97.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":118.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":128.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":132.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":138.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":142.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.17,"local_amount":213.8,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":226.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353629},{"amount":44.47,"local_amount":118.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":125.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091380},{"amount":95.16,"local_amount":253.75,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":268.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777974},{"amount":101.92,"local_amount":271.8,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-03T09:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":287.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147425},{"amount":53.28,"local_amount":142.07,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-01T11:11:43Z","rounded_local_amount":150.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258107}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T17:58:42Z","paid_date":"2015-01-01T11:11:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":598573,"name":"Juana Paula","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Juana tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera y tiene dos hijos que dependen de ella, sus ingresos provienen de la venta de tortillas y tiene 30 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a esta actividad.\nDo\u00f1a Juana su negocio est\u00e1 ubicado en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n, es una persona muy trabajadora y con deseos de salir adelante necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ma\u00edz, le\u00f1a y cal, espera con esta inversi\u00f3n obtener los ingresos necesarios para apoyar a sus hijos en los estudios.\nDo\u00f1a Juana espera que su calidad de vida mejore con las inversi\u00f3n y poder seguir apoyando a sus hijos, su sue\u00f1o es poder en un futuro mejorar su casa y que sus hijos terminan sus estudios para que se conviertan en personas de bien con principios y valores.\n\n\nTegucigalpa, Honduras \u2013 Agosto del 2013\n\n","en":"Juana is 49 years old and is single with two dependent children.

With TAHUDE Foundation\u2019s advice, Urio has realized one opportunity of reducing his daily expenses by converting his waste livestock dung into money. Thus, he has applied for a loan of USD 625 to build a biodigester that will help him cut exorbitant expenditure in energy and also he will get \u201cfree fertilizer\u201d which is the end product released from the biodigester. This is an investment with multiple benefits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1411688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

Several times she has requested loans from local financial institutions for her hair care business start-up but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of her low income and lack of experience in this new business. The only source of income for her family is the small monthly salary earned by Zhana\u2019s father working as a mini-bus driver. Her brother studies at high school and needs a lot of money for student expenses. \r\n\r\nZhana has high education but she is unable to find a job with her profession and generate an income, so she requested a loan from Credo to start a beauty salon. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with reasonable conditions for the country's vulnerable poor who do not have access to standard credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nZhana will purchase equipment for her beauty salon and start up a hair care business. She will hire experienced stylists, and according her estimations, the business will be profitable and will increase the income of her family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the same business. Her family will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living

years old, a widow, and has raised three children (two daughters and one son). Sayragul has secondary technical education. The neighbors speak of her as a friendly and responsible woman. After the death of her husband, Sayragul pulled herself together, bravely endured the loss of her husband and took the whole burden of caring for and supporting her children, and the welfare of the family as a whole. The two daughters live and work in Russia, and they help family financially, sending their salary every month. The son lives together with his mother. \r\n\r\nAs main income for the family, Sayragul has worked with livestock breeding since 1996, after having started this business with 1,200 som (KGS). She has long experience in breeding and keeping livestock. Thanks to persistent work, Sayragul has two dairy cows, one horse, one foal and one heifer on her farm. Her business brings in around 6,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as the basis for covering food and household expenses for the family. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Sayragul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of bull-calves. Sayragul plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, and in the future she also intends to repair her house where she lives with her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1410746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bull-calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Tyuz village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-22T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-21T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sayragul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":10081.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426997},{"amount":203.48,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10081.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.77,"payment_id":459019495},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":20162.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462769}],"funded_date":"2013-08-26T15:51:46Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":593692,"name":"Chultem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Chultem is 29-years-old.

She shares that her alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until she could return. \n\nEdelmira shares that it is important to her to graduate on time so she can enter into the job market as soon as possible. With this loan, Edelmira plans to cover the cost of her graduation fees. Often, there are fees for earning your title in business before graduating. \n\nTo help afford her school and living expenses, Edelmira currently works as a secretary. In addition to her responsibilities at school, she works 40 hours a week and earns $8 a day. With a career in business, she expects to earn $13 a day, a substantial increase from before. \n\nUnfortunately, Edelmira's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, her parents never had the chance to move up. Growing up, finances have always been tight. As the youngest of nine, with two older siblings attending college already, Edelmira is unsure how she will be able to finance her education on her own without the assistance of a Vittana loan. \n\nEdelmira is married with her own children. With a professional degree and a career in business, she hopes to be able to provide her family with a better life. \n\nThis loan is administered by Vittana's partner, Banco

Sanakhshire. Besik is the only one who makes money in his household by doing construction work and completing custom projects locally. Besik is a very enthusiastic man and wants to generate more income and help the family. Their existing income is not enough to cover everyday expenses. So, Besik decided to start up a grocery store, but found that he didn't have enough money to do so. Unfortunately, Besik was unable to obtain a loan from existing financial institutions, as they require a stable income and business experience as a precondition for a loan. But Besik has now received his loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides start-up and re-start up loans with simple terms to the country's vulnerable poor who do not have access to credit. With a loan of 2,500 USD, Besik will rent commercial space in his district and purchase basic groceries for starting up a store. He will care for his clients and treat them in a kind and friendly way. With this determination and his loan he expects to improve his income and give his family members better living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1411699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She gives the business four hours each day and in addition to this business she also grows bananas as a way of supplementing her income. Jovia started growing pineapples in 2000 in rural Bushenyi District. Her main objective in starting the business was to get money to pay school fees for her eight children.  Her clients are mainly the people in her local cell and she sometimes gets customers from different villages when they are passing by.

Near the village where Marine and her family live, they own a plot of agricultural land, where they cultivate corn and potatoes and grow different types of fruits (plums, nuts, apples, and pears).\r\n\r\nMarine and her husband work really hard to gather good a harvest, sell it locally and sustain their living. They have an 11-year-old son, who attends school and sometimes helps his parents with cattle breeding.\r\n\r\nMarine has taken a loan from a financial institution before, but because of the family's poor conditions, she wasn't able to pay it back. However, over these years of tireless work, she was able to own her farm, which is profitable enough to cover monthly payments. Marie has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have bad credit history behind them and have no access to credit products.

She covers her daily food consumption via rice cropping on a one hectare area and by working for others, for a fee. This is the business that she has occupied for ages.  \r\n\r\nChaily is a second-time borrower with VisionFund Cambodia (Kiva\u2018s partner). The past loan which she has repaid has enabled her to support her living and her business on-time.

Grace, just like most of the group members, does fishing as her major source of income and she gives this business a maximum of six hours per day. She started fishing in the year 1991 with high hopes of making profits and hence catering to her needs and the needs of the children. \r\n\r\nGrace has additional income from a bar which is in the same area and which she operates when she is off the fishing business, especially in the evening. She hopes to use the money to buy more fish nets and drinks for her bar so that she is able to catch more fish and serve her customers better and hence make more sales which would result in high profits. Grace\u2019s clients are the residents of Kasenyi cell and Kigabo. Her major challenges are the debts which come as a result of people drinking at her bar and not paying and the thieves who are quite many in the area. Her honesty and hard work have helped her to attain the business success which she is proud of.

After the successful loan that she has fully repaid, she can maintain her agribusiness well and keep supporting her children in school. \r\n\r\nNow, she is taking out a new loan in order to support her daughter, who is pursuing her bachelor degree majoring in accounting.

She is married and the mother of a large family (one daughter and four sons). Kurbantaaji has graduated from a technical college and is an accountant by trade. At present she works as an accountant in a hospital. She has 36 years of work experience. Her colleagues describe her as a responsible, goal-oriented and thoughtful person. Her husband and children help her out in the household. She has a tight-knit family, with a very good family climate. As an additional source of income for her family, Kurbantaaji has been raising livestock for many years, having launched this business with a starting capital of 1,000 KGS. Thanks to Kurbantaaji\u2019s hard work, she now has four dairy cows and 20 sheep. Her farm brings in about 10,000 KGS per month from sales of dairy products, which is the main source of covering costs of food and basic needs for her family. The income from her farm has allowed Kurbantaaji to raise her children and help them get started in life. In order to develop her farm further, Kurbantaaji has applied to the Bai Tushum & Partner microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy cattle. Kurbantaaji plans to invest her revenues into a further growth of her farm. In the future, she also plans to save enough money to be able to pay for her youngest son\u2019s wedding.

She previously accessed a 26,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) loan that she used to buy spare parts and accessories and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit (see footnote). Her earnings were a big help in her personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n \r\nShe would like to apply for a new 22,000 PHP loan for her to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nEditha hopes to have additional jeepneys and dreams to help her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn. They modified the jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1052753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

As\u00ed mismo, cuando se le presenta improvistos tiene que viajar hasta la cuidad y el sistema de transporte es muy irregular; por lo que tiene que realizar viajes de todo el d\u00eda y con su motocicleta el tiempo de desplazamiento sera mas r\u00e1pido y no perder\u00e1 todo el d\u00eda en viajar; ya que recorre aproximadamente 45km. \n\n Los sue\u00f1os que ha pensado concretizar para un futuro es instalar su propio negocio y espec\u00edficamente una comercial de la cual ya posee experiencia en esta actividad  y sabe que tiene que trabajar fuerte para lograrlo, porque en el momento que decida tener su familia, poder tener ingresos para que no les falte nada.","en":"Esau, 26, is single and lives with his parents. He has been working for two and a half years as a salesman in a store. When he finished high school, he was offered the opportunity to work there and did not think twice to start, despite his lack of experience. This is currently his only activity. His workplace is located 3 km away from home, but he travels to nearby cities as part of his job. He works from 7 am to 5 pm.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy a motorcycle, which will be useful since it will make it easier for him to go to work. Sometimes, unplanned things happen and he has to go to the city using public transport, which is an irregular service. This takes him all day.

All of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Zurab applied for the credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of a start-up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva. This program enables the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nA loan of $3,000 will help him to purchase a minibus.

She knows exactly what she wants and achieves everything with her own strengths, but also knows how to properly use and plan funds for achieving her goals. \r\n\r\nHer husband, a small businessman, also helps around the farm. As the main source of income for the family, Saadat has been involved since 2009 in raising livestock, starting this business with 15,000 som (KGS). She has quite a lot of experience in breeding and caring for livestock. \r\n\r\nThanks to hard work, Saadat has on her farm: two dairy cows and nine sheep. Her farm brings in about 6,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as the basis for food expenses and the household needs of the family.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her farm, Saadat turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase foals. \r\n\r\nSaadat plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her farm, and in this way in the future intends to make repairs on the home in which she lives with her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1411671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy foals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jany-Bazar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T14:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T14:50:10Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":91.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saadat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":406.96,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20162.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.54,"payment_id":459019498},{"amount":411.19,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":20162.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.31,"payment_id":529946768},{"amount":740.59,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":40325.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":84.41,"payment_id":595435847}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T20:11:36Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":596504,"name":"Ngan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngan is requesting a new loan to buy a range of new products, such as household items and food, to restock her general store.

poder tener acceso a la educaci\u00f3n secundaria, se dedic\u00f3 a buscar el sustento por cuenta propia. Est\u00e1 casada con Segundo un agricultor de 71 a\u00f1os con quien formaron un hogar siendo muy j\u00f3venes. Elvia vive con su esposo y su hija quien aporta para los gastos del hogar. Viven en el Cant\u00f3n de Salcedo ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. En Salcedo existen varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como lagunas y balnearios que ofrecen deportes extremos para sus turistas aventureros, sin embargo la principal actividad que desarrollan en este pueblo es la agricultura y en menor cuant\u00eda la ganader\u00eda. Los productos agr\u00edcolas m\u00e1s comercializados son granos como arveja, fr\u00e9jol, lenteja, haba y tambi\u00e9n varias frutas y verduras. La producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados abastece la distribuci\u00f3n interna y el excedente se env\u00eda a la Regi\u00f3n Costa en productos ya procesados. La crianza de animales es tambi\u00e9n muy favorable por el  clima agradable del que se goza en el Cant\u00f3n. A pesar de estas actividades productivas, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares. \nElvia se dedica desde hace 30 a\u00f1os a la crianza de animales dom\u00e9sticos como cuyes, cerdos conejos, pollos, codornices, etc  y adem\u00e1s a la producci\u00f3n de tomate de \u00e1rbol. Es un trabajo que le gusta mucho y por lo cual le dedica hasta 10 horas cada d\u00eda, paralelamente a los quehaceres dom\u00e9sticos en su hogar. Elvia ha adquirido la suficiente experiencia para paso a paso llevar su negocio hacia el crecimiento, sin embargo la falta de oportunidades de financiamiento no le han permitido surtir su negocio como ella quisiera, es por esto que ahora solicita un cr\u00e9dito con el cual comprar\u00e1 al menos un animal de cada tipo para incrementar sus utilidades y as\u00ed poder aportar con los gastos de su hogar y tener un ahorro conveniente para los gastos de salud que implican el cuidado a su edad.  Elvia agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por la oportunidad que le brindan de dar un nuevo paso de crecimiento en su negocio y motiva a los inversionistas de Kiva a seguir apoyando el emprendimiento y esfuerzo de las personas de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el mundo.","en":"Elvia is 66 years old, and has been working since she was a young girl.  She did not have access to secondary education, and decided to seek a means of providing for her own livelihood.  She is married to Segundo, a farmer who is 71 years old.  They formed a home together when they were young.  Elvia lives with her husband and their daughter, who contributes to the home expenses.  They live in the canton of Salcedo, located in the western part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces of the mountain area of Ecuador.  In Salcedo, there are various tourist attractions, like lagoons and spas, and they also offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main activity of the area is agriculture and, to a lesser extent, raising livestock.  The agricultural products that are marketed the most in this area are seeds and grains like peas, beans, lentils, broad beans, and different types of fruits and vegetables.  Milk and its derivatives are first dispersed internally, and the surplus is sent to the coastal region as processed products.  Raising animals is also favorable in this town due to the pleasant climate.  Despite these productive activities, there are worrying rates of illiteracy and poverty due to lack of basic needs, like a sewage system; only 25% of homes in this area have one.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years, Elvia has made a living raising domestic animals like guinea pigs, pigs, rabbits, chickens, quails, etc.  She also grows tree tomatoes.  She likes this work, and spends ten hours every day working while also performing household chores.  Elvia has sufficient experience to grow her business little by little.  However, the lack of financing opportunities has prevented her from supplying her business as she would like.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is now requesting a loan.  She will buy at least one of each type of animal in order to increase her profits and thereby be able to contribute some money to the home expenses.  She will also be able to have savings in order to cover health costs related to caring for herself as she gets older.  \r\n\r\nElvia thanks the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the opportunity they have offered her to give her business new growth, and for encouraging the Kiva investors to continue supporting the projects and efforts of the people of Latin America and the world.

The children are all in school. Ainura's main activity is raising short-horned livestock. In the year 2000, she became involved in raising livestock because she has all the needed conditions for livestock. She is helped in this work by her husband; he is also well-versed in this. Ainura's business started with 30,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to her backbreaking labor and capacious work, Ainura achieved a little success in developing her farm and has been receiving a monthly profit of 8,000 som (KGS). Today, Ainura has on her farm: two dairy cows and one calf. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her farm, Ainura turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow with calf. \r\n\r\nAinura plans to invest income from the loan in further increasing the count of livestock on her farm, and in this way to buy a car in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1411890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

All of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Ioseb applied for credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of a Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva. This program enables the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $3,100 will help him to purchase a minibus. Once the minibus is purchased, he will transport passengers on the minibus line from his district to another. This will significantly increase the family income.

When she got married and had children, she had to think now only about herself but also about the future of the children. After consulting with her husband, she started to sell different kinds of children's clothing. She did not have a trade stall and her working capital was quite small. She had enough strength and patience to increase her working capital with the help of her activities, supporting her husband and relatives. \r\n\r\nFor the past seven years, Matluba has been trading various kinds of children's clothing and shoes. Her trade outlet is located in the local area market. \r\nShe has many customers and her businesses is officially registered. \r\n\r\nShe plans in the future to expand her working capital, and for this she needs additional investment. She has previously borrowed from IMON International and has referred to them repeatedly (12th cycle) with the aim of obtaining a loan for working capital.

Every year after the harvest, Aleksandr tried to install a new greenhouse. During this time, Aleksandr had success in his business and now he has eight heated greenhouses.\r\n\r\nAleksandr plans to invest 20,000 hryvnia in the acquisition of plastic film and fertilizers and in greenhouse repairs. He needs to prepare a cold greenhouse, to warm them while a second crop grows. He needs to cover the greenhouse with a second film, to repair the windows as they are wind-damaged, and to purchase fertilizer for better plant growth. Then with the arrival of the cold, the crop will be protected and Aleksandr will be able to sell the crop at a good price."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1410931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase film and fertilizer and to fix his greenhouses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T16:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T16:50:01Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2475,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":20089.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440006060}],"funded_date":"2013-08-24T07:48:20Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:25:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":598729,"name":"D\u00fao Solidario Bethlehem Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao Solidario Bethlehe, este grupo esta conformado por la se\u00f1ora Marta Alicia de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, se a dedica desde hace 10 a\u00f1os a la venta de productos de granos basicos.(tienda)y como actividad secundario se dedica a la venta de le\u00f1a, esta muy contenta ya que kiva le a ayudado en gran manera en su negocio, por esa razon nuevamente esta solicitando este credito para la compra de productos de granos basicos, desde ya les agradese por la ayuda brindada y que Dios los bendiga donde quiera que esten.","en":"\r\nMarta Alicia is a member of Bethlehem Duo.

Given the lack of employment opportunities and the difficult economic situation in which her family found itself, she decided to look for options to generate income on her own. As a result, a few months ago she began her own business selling clothing. She uses a small space in her house as her shop, which she fixed up to have a small counter and rack to display her products. She now has the opportunity to sell to people who pass by her home, and in this way earns enough income to help her husband with their home expenses. Gladis is an entrepreneurial woman, very active, who puts in a great deal of effort into growing and improving her business every day. She hopes to someday convert her business into a larger clothing store, recognized in her region. \r\n\r\nFor this reason she is asking for a new loan, which she will invest in the purchase of merchandise (blouses, jeans, underwear), taking advantage of the discounts available for buying in bulk. This way, she will be able to offer a variety of items that satisfy her clients' needs. She will be able to improve her sales and therefore her income, with which she will be able to provide a greater level of wellbeing and quality of life for her family.

It is helping a lot in her variety store as she was able to buy additional products and grocery items. Her loan is also assisting in the education of her children and their household expenses. Her variety store has been running for 13 years now and it keeps on growing. She also has a direct selling business for additional income. \n\nSusan would like to apply for another 40,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help cover her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \n\nSusan hopes for continuous growth in her business as well as in her spiritual life.

He completed primary school and his studies have helped him to acquire various jobs that enable him to sustain his daily needs. Carlos and his wife live in Latacunga, a city that is currently growing very fast. This city is the capital of the Cotopaxi province of Ecuador, and is one of the most important cities in the country. It is known for its rich gastronomy, specifically \"las hallullas\", which are hard cookies in the form of bread - traditional in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile. The region is also known for its cheeses, in addition to its livestock and agricultural activities which are sustained due to its temperate climate. The level of poverty in this region exceeds 50%, however the majority of residents have at least basic services such as housing. \r\n\r\nCarlos inherited his entrepreneurial spirit from his mother who learned to raise chickens for later sale. Carlos dreams of having his own car with which he can move between villages, helping him with his animal sales. However, in in order to achieve this goal he must increase his production, and to do so must buy baby chickens and begin to raise them - selling them once they have grown and gained weight. It is for this reason that he is asking for this loan. The lack of opportunities to obtain working capital has been a large obstacle for the growth of his business, however he was recommended to visit Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, which thanks to the support of Kiva and its investors, was able to offer Carlos the ability to ask for this loan. This loan will open the doors for his business to grow and stabilize, enabling Carlos to achieve his dreams.

He said, \"This is to tell business stories to the world.\" Jonathan is a 48-year-old man who stopped his education right after he obtained a high school diploma. He decided to do business to make some money to improve his living conditions, so he asked and got a little money from his father to establish his business. Now he runs a shop which sells cement in the area of Gbarnga, which is the capital city of Bong County and is well known as the centre point of Liberia. He requested a 100,000 LRD loan to buy more cement for his business.\n \nJonathan D. mentioned his hard work and his seriousness gained him this business two years ago. His goods are always brought to his shop by truck, and a problem he faces is the road conditions to the shop. He opens his shop by 8am and closes by 6pm from Monday to Saturday. His customers comment most of the time about how helpful his business has been. He is the only one who cannot go out of stock,  his distribution to his customers is always on time, and he sells his cement at a minimal price. He is happy about his business because the business makes him popular and gives him more money.  \n\nJonathan D.is married and his wife stays at home.

He lives in Mombasa, Kenya where he owns a cereals shop. He also has another shop where he sells clothes. Iddi started the business three years ago and it is doing great.
