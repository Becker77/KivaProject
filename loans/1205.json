She\u2019s spent her entire productive life working as an employee in various restaurants and cafeterias but a year ago she decided to become independent and open her own business: a restaurant she works in Monday to Sunday aiming at taking maximum advantage of its location because it\u2019s across from a bus terminal and many mechanic shops are nearby which has led to good sales results.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a hardworking, active, enterprising woman who is dedicated to her work.  This motivates her to request another loan cycle to buy supplies (meat, grains, vegetables, soft-drinks, fruit) aiming at having more ingredients on-hand to prepare the meals she sells and to make use of some fixed assets she has that are currently under used and she wants to make maximum use of.\r\n\r\nMariela dreams with opening another restaurant that will be well-known for the quality of the products she sells and for the excellent service it provides.  This will attract more customers and she will be able to continue meeting her basic needs because her income will increase significantly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1416012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies (meat, grains, vegetables, soft-drinks, fruit).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T18:50:08Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariela De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":107150},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":110106},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":113144},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":116265},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":119472},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":122768},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":126155},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":129635},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":133212},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":136886},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":140663},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":144544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.02},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.53,"local_amount":94751,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":97138.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807415},{"amount":58.48,"local_amount":109652,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":112414.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095504},{"amount":60.1,"local_amount":112682,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":115521.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074565},{"amount":265.59,"local_amount":497975,"processed_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":510522.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523353},{"amount":132.18,"local_amount":247844,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":254089.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490855552},{"amount":72.28,"local_amount":135531,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":138946.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520982689},{"amount":74.8,"local_amount":140252,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":143786.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531791114},{"amount":86.04,"local_amount":161313,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":165377.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542542843}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T09:55:57Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T14:31:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":598870,"name":"Olga Luc\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olga, a sus 40 a\u00f1os es casada y no tiene hijos.

","en":"Roza is 48 years old, married, and is raising two children (one daughter, one son). She has a high school education. Her husband helps around the farm. The elder son works in a sewing shop and helps his parents financially; the daughter is of preschool age. \r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for her family, Roza since 1990 has been engaged in raising livestock and crops, starting this business with 25 som (KGS). She has quite a lot of experience in breeding and raising livestock. Thanks to Roza's hard work, her farm has: one dairy cow, one horse, 12 sheep, and has a plot of land measuring 3.0 hectares on which she grows clover. Her agricultural activities bring in about 16,000 som (KGS) per month, which is the basis of food expenses and household needs for the family. \r\n\r\nIncome from the farm allowed Roza to increase the number of livestock, and improve living standards. In order to further develop her farm, Roza turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nRoza plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her farm, and in this way intends in the future to save money for her son's

Her husband has been manufacturing plastic side mirror frames of vehicles through an injection molding machine for many years. He buys plastic raw material from the market and puts it into the injection molding machine. The raw material becomes melted under high temperature and then is injected into the dies through compression to give it a specific shape. In this way he manufactures the mirror frames, sells them into the market and makes enough income to contribute to the family's livelihood.\n\nBushra has three children and she barely manages to satisfy their needs. She is required to provide them with good food, health, and education. She needs to earn additional income to support her family well. She is in her third loan cycle with BRAC Pakistan. Currently she has requested a loan of PKR 40,000 to buy more raw materials for manufacturing so that her husband could increase his sales. She expects a boost in earnings and wishes to spend part of the profits on the expansion of the business.\n\nBushra is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner BRAC

start over in the morning,\u201d says Shani, who is a Nepali by birth, speaks the local dialect and has been married for more than a decade. Untiring effort and relentlessness can be seen with her life venture. She is the featured borrower member and is pictured with her hand raised. \n\nShani and the other eight members joined hands and formed the Chullou B Group. \u201cChullou\u201d signifies \u201ceverlasting\u201d in Thadou dialect, and Shani believes in everlasting relationships among the members. She lives in the village with the rest of the group members. The village is about 35 kms away from the capital town of Imphal, which is also one of the Northeastern states in India.\n\nShani runs a tea-stall in the middle of the area market. She prepares puri (deep-fried bread), toast and tea, and sells them. She is earning well and is happy. The tea-stall is open at the break of dawn and is open until late. The location of the tea-stall gives a lot of advantage for Shani, as the public transport buses and jeep parking is close by, and drivers usually stop at the stall for tea and snacks. The passengers, as well, feed themselves with tea and snacks while waiting for the other passengers to board the vehicle. Passengers start thronging in at the break of dawn, as they wait for the first vehicle to head towards the capital city. \n\nChit-chatting with her customers helped Shani acknowledge the need to open a grocery shop in the area. The surrounding villagers typically travel another extra 4 kms to the town market, spending an extra 30 INR as jeep fare, only to purchase essential commodities like salt, soap, cereals, etc. The generated income from running a tea-stall is insufficient to expand the shop with grocery items. \n\nShani wants the loan from Kiva to expand her tea-stall with selling grocery items. The plan of expansion of the business is to provide the nearby villagers with groceries and essential items. This will also make extra earnings for her, and helps the villagers to avoid unnecessary traveling to the town market. She thanked Kiva and WSDS for the support. And, says she will repay the loan on time and will continue to build a good relationship with WSDS and Kiva.\n\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in a grocery shop, piggery, weaving, clothes-selling, etc.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1403915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to expand her tea-stall and start selling essential commodities\/grocery items for profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lunneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shani Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-27T02:53:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":596574,"name":"Majd Baysour Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sanaa is the featured borrower of Majd Baysour Group, she joined with the other group members to acquire a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua because they have always been neighbors and friends. \r\n\r\nSanaa is a 49-year-old married mother of two who has been working in souvenir sales for five years to help her husband cover their family's living expenses.

It is also well known because there is a train carriage that is used as a restaurant. Reme tells us \"This carriage was just a small part of the train that was left here, but now it functions as a restaurant and people know it well, the best product is the delicious coffees.\"\r\n\r\nReme is a hard working woman who is always very happy. She is 46 years old and has been married to Le\u00f3n for 25 years; they have a family together and have three children, one of whom is still in secondary school.\r\n\r\nReme has made school uniforms for a living for 22 years. \"I worked with a man who made uniforms and I learnt from him, then I taught my husband and he knows more than me now. We started working alone with a single machine making little dresses for girls\", Reme tells us. Little by little the workshop grew thanks to loans of an alternate finance company for a long time, after a long time with this other company she encountered Vision Fund and KIVA and decided to change. \r\n\r\nNow she is requesting a loan to buy fabric threads and stockings, she will also use the loan to maintain her sewing machines. She used the loan to pay for fabric and proved to be reliable, now she is very happy because she can make her deposit, pay on time and she will be able to deliver her orders on time. The uniforms she has made to date are because her customers came to order their uniforms and paid a deposit so she had the security of selling the uniform when it is made.\r\n\r\nIt seems that she will have no trouble succeeding with her business although she would like an embroidery machine so she will no longer have to pay others for this service. They will make a great effort to buy the embroidery machine to be able to improve the business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1403793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, stockings, threads, buttons etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro, El Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Remedios","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5113.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5378.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5696.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":5950.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6279.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6582.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":439.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":459.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":484.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":507.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":397.35,"local_amount":5150.84,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T09:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5163.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944879},{"amount":415.05,"local_amount":5380.29,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5393.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227954},{"amount":439.64,"local_amount":5699.06,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5712.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991799},{"amount":459.21,"local_amount":5952.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5967.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644447},{"amount":484.58,"local_amount":6281.65,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6296.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877909},{"amount":504.17,"local_amount":6535.43,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6551.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766957}],"funded_date":"2013-08-24T18:25:37Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Godwin","image":null}},{"id":596580,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is 41 years old and married with five children, four of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

Her business consists of selling foufou (local food), miscellaneous drinks, and fuel. She says her biggest challenge so far in her business is creating customer loyalty. With this next loan she will be able to buy more of each of these items to further grow her inventory. By buying in bulk, she will be able to reduce her prices, giving her a competitive advantage in her bustling stall. Audrey has big dreams for the future of her family.

Hace 10 a\u00f1os Celia se inici\u00f3 como agricultora de los productos m\u00e1s rentables que crecen en su zona en un terreno de 2 hect\u00e1reas que le cedieron sus padres cuando asumi\u00f3 su compromiso con su esposo. La agricultura es una actividad muy sacrificada pero desde sus inicios le ayuda a mantener econ\u00f3micamente a su familia teniendo el  firme apoyo de su esposo. Celia se dedica a cultivar cacao org\u00e1nico seguido de barbasco y algunos \u00e1rboles frutales. Para facilitar las labores que realiza contrata constantemente a trabajadores del lugar a quienes paga todos lo d\u00edas. Comenta que siempre debe contar con capital de trabajo para invertir en sus plantaciones y desarrollar sin contratiempos la correspondiente campa\u00f1a productiva. Lo que m\u00e1s le agrada de su trabajo es vender las almendras de cacao secas a los acopiadores del lugar ya que recibe el pago correspondiente de manera inmediata y recupera el dinero que invirti\u00f3 con las respectivas ganancias. Tiene muchos objetivos a largo plazo siendo uno de ellos apoyar a sus hijos cuando sean j\u00f3venes para que logren ser profesionales. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con Kiva y se siente agradecida por el apoyo financiero que recibe para seguir adelante, adem\u00e1s se compromete a pagar sus cuotas de manera puntual. En esta oportunidad desea contar con 2,000 nuevos soles para la compra de abono org\u00e1nico para sus sembr\u00edos.\n","en":"Celia is a 31 year old woman, married to Marcelino. They have 3 children with whom they live in their adobe house. 10 years ago Celia started farming the most profitable products. She grows them on a two hectare plot that was given to her by her parents when she got married. Farming is a very demanding activity but since the beginning it has helped her provide for her family, with the support of her husband. \r\n\r\nCelia grows organic cocoa, followed by barbasco (native tropical American plant) and a few fruit trees. In order to keep up with the work they constantly hire local labor, paid by the day. Celia says that she needs working capital to invest in her plantations and successfully manage the growing season. What she enjoys most about her work is selling the dried cocoa beans to the local buyers, as she gets paid immediately and gets back the money she has invested. She has many long term goals, one of them being able to support her children while they are young so they can grow up to be professionals.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support so she can move forward. She promises to pay her installments in a timely fashion.

Aurelia is a farmer and she learnt this trade through her parents who introduced her to this family activity from a young age in an honest way. This explains how she grew up in the countryside with knowledge of the trade, and when she turned 18, she got engaged and had her first son meaning that she had to become independent from her parents and start a new life alongside her husband.\r\n\r\nAfter four years of working as laborers, they managed to buy a two hectare plot of land where they started to produce cacao and barbasco among other crops. Aurelia feels she can identify with this work as it has helped her a lot to financially support her family and, after 21 years of constant work, she stills feels highly motivated to this day and has a lot of objectives to accomplish. The sale of barbasco has also proved an excellent source of income as it fetches a good price in the market. For all the work that she performs, she always tries to count on the help of workers in the area to finish tasks pending in a shorter period of time and in a uniform manner.\r\n\r\nOne of Aurelia's main objectives is to build her own home with good quality materials, she hopes to improve her quality of life and knows that this will only be possible with a lot of effort.

Delia has worked in agriculture and in the fields since she was a girl and learned from her parents and grandparents.  She shares the work with her husband, who is her main support.  She says her main objective is to ensure that her cacao plants sprout good quality pods, since that is the only way to get a good price for them.  \r\n\r\nSince she lives in a town far from her fields, she has to get up at dawn every day and get her children ready to go to school and later start her farm work.  On occasion, rainy days make the roads that access her fields difficult to pass, so her work has to be a day late.  For the next growing season, she wants to renovate three blocks and replace the older cocoa trees that are no longer producing.

Nichoibong is short in height, studied until primary level, and runs a tea-stall for her income. Her tea-stall is also captured in the picture where the group member stands in the front of the tea-stall. She belongs to Olive SHG Group and is the featured borrower member for the group. She is pictured with her hand raised. \r\n\r\nAll the members live in the same village, and all are engaged in income-generating activity. The group was formed to encourage, motivate and be financially independent. The village is about 30 kms away from the main town of Imphal, and it is also one of the capital states in the northeastern states of India.\r\n\r\nNichoibong has been running the tea-stall for more than a couple of years, and before this she used to grow chives and sell them. The tea-stall is in the front yard of her house, and it is built with a tin roof, knotted bamboo and no concrete flooring. \r\n\r\nThe tea-stall is open at the break of the dawn and closes down at sunset. She sells tea, toast and puri (fried flatbread) in the morning. Most of the time she uses firewood and charcoal for heating, as the liquefied petroleum gas is expensive. The firewood is sometimes collected by herself from the nearby fields to save some income. She usually gets the supplies from the main city market, and she also purchases on credit from the village grocery shop. \r\n\r\nNichoibong prepares good tea with tasty puri and toast, which is the main attraction for the villagers. People buzz in during the early morning to have tea and puri for breakfast. At daybreak, elders hang out at the stall and kill time. Farmers also stop at the tea-stall in the evening when they return from the field to have a cup of tea. Her warm and humble nature attracts people to sit and have tea at the stall. \r\n\r\nThe generated income is mostly used to manage the family expenses, and the case gets worse when the credit repayment from customers fails. \r\n\r\nNichoibong wants the loan to purchase bags of flour and wheat, milk powder, edible oil and extra gas. With the stock list, she will be able to run the business efficiently without worrying about the next day. She will open an account and start monthly savings for the future, and also repay the loan on time. She is happy that Kiva and WSDS create a platform for women who need financial support, and she wishes them good luck.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in a piggery, vegetable-selling, poultry, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1409803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase bags of wheat and flour, edible oil, and stock for her tea-stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T20:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T20:50:06Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thoitakhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roimucham","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jatakhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thangmuring","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jianpui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nichoibong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoitakem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoitakcham","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paraem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thamchim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T05:21:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":596598,"name":"Mwanajuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanajuma is a single woman without children.

they named themselves \u201cNazareth SHG\u201d. The village is about 35 kms away from the main capital town of Imphal, which is also one of the northeastern state capitals in India. \r\n\r\nRahablu is the featured borrower member, pictured with her hand raised on the extreme left in the picture.  All the members cooperate and agreed to form the group to support one another financially and morally in times of one\u2019s needs. The purpose of the formation of the group is to be financially independent and supplement the family income to be self-sufficient families.\r\n\r\nRahablu sells chives in the capital market and makes an income. Selling chives is her main activity to generate an income. The market town is about 35 kms away from the village where she lives. She marches towards the market at the break of the dawn, as buyers come early in the morning to get the fresh vegetables. The major population in the state uses chives in most of the dishes; thus selling chives is profitable. She shares that growing chives is easy, as the climate is suitable, there is no limited season for growing, and market demand never ceases. \r\n\r\nThe generated income is insufficient, as household expenses and educational expenses are high in this period. She hardly managed to save a small amount to purchase seedlings and grow them abundantly. There are times when she does not have a supply of her own, and at the same time with no cash to buy chives from the suppliers and sell them at a profit.\r\n\r\nWith the KIva Loan, she is planning to purchase chives seedlings with the right fertilizers. Hopeful and filled with delight, she shares that her plans to grow chives on a large scale have come true.

My name is Alberto. I have been happily married for the last 18 years and have two beautiful daughters, Diana Guadalupe and Paola Guadalupe. Both go to school. I am a car mechanic and fortunately I have many recurring clients. I am changing my car shop from a place that I rent, to my house. By doing that, I will be able to save some money in the rent that I am paying. I will use the loan to refurbish the place. In general, my clients seek me, they tell me what is wrong with their cars, and I provide them with a budget. Once they agree, I start fixing the car. I have been a car mechanic for the last 30 years and have owned my car shop for the last 14 years.\r\n\r\nMy biggest accomplishment is owning a business and a house and sending my daughters to school. My next goal is to make my business grow. I believe I am a credit-worthy person because I always pay my debts on time.

Capital de una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador; Cotopaxi y que los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante a pesar de que las estad\u00edsticas indican un \u00edndice de pobreza que supera el 50%. Sin embargo el gobierno seccional y la empresa privada han aportado para que sea una ciudad en constante crecimiento, es as\u00ed que recientemente se ha construido un aeropuerto y centros comerciales que han generado fuentes de empleo para muchos de sus habitantes quienes tambi\u00e9n conservan un esp\u00edritu emprendedor como es el caso de Edwin un joven esposo y padre de 24 a\u00f1os, estudi\u00f3 la secundaria y siendo muy joven se cas\u00f3 con Yolanda de su misma edad que se dedica al cuidado de su hogar. Tienen 2 hijos que est\u00e1n estudiando en una escuela p\u00fablica y a quienes esperan verlos convertidos en profesionales de excelencia. \nEdwin desde hace 5 a\u00f1os se dedica al comercio de frutas y verduras, negocio que decidi\u00f3 emprender por la falta de oportunidades laborales en su ciudad. \u00c9l disfruta mucho de su trabajo, por lo que ninguna tarea es complicada a pesar de que invierte m\u00ednimo 8 horas desde muy temprano en la ma\u00f1ana, hasta la tarde que es en donde las ventas se reducen y adem\u00e1s los productos se agotan. Cada temporada del a\u00f1o Edwin debe abastecerse de los productos que sus proveedores traen y que son demandados en el mercado. La falta de capital y las dificultades para obtener financiamiento han sido obst\u00e1culos que Edwin ha tenido que vivir en cada etapa de su negocio, sin embargo ha buscado siempre la manera de tener las frutas y verduras m\u00e1s demandadas. Ahora la temporada cambia y el surtido de su negocio empieza a decaer, por lo cual solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar frutas y verduras de temporada con las cuales pueda atraer m\u00e1s clientes y as\u00ed ganar reconocimiento en la ciudad, adem\u00e1s que esto le generar\u00e1 mayores utilidades con lo cual puede brindar a su familia un mejor estilo de vida, incluida la educaci\u00f3n de excelencia que espera que sus hijos reciban. \nEdwin da gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por la oportunidad que le brindan de buscar crecimiento en su negocio, pues est\u00e1 muy contento con la atenci\u00f3n recibida y con la asesor\u00eda personalizada que su ejecutivo de cuenta le brinda en cada visita.","en":"Latacunga is a city that has many attractions for domestic and foreign tourists, mainly the historic center of the city that has been considered Cultural Heritage of Ecuador for nearly 30 years.  It is the Capitol of a province that is part of the Sierra region of Ecuador, Cotopaxi and in recent years has developed significantly in a way that is considered one of the most important in the region thanks to the flower industry, mining, metallurgy, agribusiness, agriculture and livestock. In addition, there are businesses that generate interesting income, which makes it a commercial town with several opportunities to get ahead even though statistics indicate a poverty rate exceeding 50%. Despite this, the government and private enterprises have contributed to the city so that it is constantly growing. Recently the town built an airport and shopping centers that have generated employment opportunities for many residents who also maintain an entrepreneurial spirit such as the case for Edwin. \r\n\r\nEdwin is young husband and father of 24. He studied in high school and though very young married Yolanda who is the same age and works to take care of their home. They have 2 children who are studying in a public school and they hope to see them become excellent professionals.\r\n\r\nEdwin has been a vendor of fruits and vegetables for 5 years when he decided to undertake business due to lack of employment opportunities in his city. He really enjoys his job, so that no task is complicated even though invests at least eight hours a day from early morning until evening. This is where sales decrease and the products are exhausted. Each season of the year Edwin stocks products from his suppliers that are demanded in the market. The lack of capital and financing difficulties has been obstacles that Edwin has had to surpass at every stage of his business. However, he has always sought ways to have more of the fruits and vegetables that are highly demanded. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1415768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seasonal fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-08-23T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-22T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1668.53,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":99.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":104.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":106.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":111.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":124.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":126.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":129.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.73},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alana Abbitt-McGregor","image":1119620}},{"id":596688,"name":"Los Amigos Empresarios Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cLOS AMIGOS EMPRESARIOS\u201d est\u00e1 conformada por  08 socios dedicados a diversas actividades del comercio minorista.

She has been interested in making clothing since she was very young, and for this reason she decided to learn the trade by taking various courses. These courses later opened doors for her in the work world. She has worked in various clothing companies, where she gained experience and perfected her technique. Her last job was in a large, well-known children's and babies' clothing company in which she worked for a number of years in order to later start her own business.

has asked for a 30,000 LRD loan to build up her business by buying more charcoal to resell. To be precise, Etta lives in West Point, one of the most populated and well-known markets in Montserrado County. She did not attend school, but she said she is good at managing her business. \r\n\r\nEtta is single with seven children between 18 and 29 years old. Only one is currently attending school, and three live at home. \r\n\r\nEtta complains that the transportation cost is her main challenge.  She enjoys the flow of her customers and the profit she makes. She sells for eight hours each day. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to build a house in the near future. She appreciates the support of BRAC Liberia.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1412071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

There he has a carpentry workshop, a trade he learned from his grandparents and parents, that has been passed on from generation to generation. His experience in woodwork dates back some 23 years when he watched his elder relatives and learned and began applying the techniques of carpentry and offering his services to the citizens of his sector.\r\n\r\nToday he produces bedroom, living room and dining room furniture, doors and windows. He sells by cash and credit every day on a productive schedule from 8:00AM until 6:00PM. He makes his purchases at wholesale stores where he finds discounts for cash and in bulk.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to increase production, and increase sales, because he needs to expand his business and hire a helper. All this will help him to earn more so he can remodel his home at a later date.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for his first Kiva loan so he can buy wood, plywood, paints, solvents, nails and accessories as he

","en":"Barnokhon is 44 years old and a widow.  Alone, she is raising four children (two sons and two daughters).  After her husband's death, Barnokhon could not get over the loss of such a close person for a long time.  She needed to raise and get four children on their feet, and Barnokhon decided to take the household and financial responsibility into her own hands.  Her children help her with this.  The oldest son works in Russia, and the youngest works as a welder.  Both sons support the family financially as they can, sending their salaries home monthly.  Barnokhon has a secondary education.  The neighbors speak of her as an entrepreneurial and organized woman.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, Barnokhon has been involved in sales of bedding, blankets and table cloths since 2010, having started this business with 60,000 som (KGS).  Farming also yields an income.  She has a 1.14 hectare land plot, where she annually plants onions, potatoes and cabbage.  Her business yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  The income from the business allowed Barnokhon to raise and situate her children.  In order to further develop her business, Barnokhon requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy merchandise, such as bedding, table cloths and blankets, wholesale for future retail sale.  She plans to use the earnings from the loan to increase her goods turnover and also to rebuild her house in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1413398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She lives with her daughter in a small home that she inherited from her mother eight years ago. She thanks God for her mother, who provided Martha will the tools to be able to make headway. She inherited her mother's home and five hectares of fertile land where she grows corn, potatoes and peas. Her land is located very far away, so Martha has to walk many hours in order to care for her crops, and during the harvest she hires laborers to work the fields with her. She says that the activity is very profitable since she transports the goods herself to the wholesale market in the city of Huancayo, where she sells her products. \"There are dates where I have to buy other crops in order to provide for my customers,\" she said. Therefore, her goal is to become a distributor and earn even better profits. This is her second loan with Kiva, and she feels grateful for the financial support she receives to make headway. Furthermore, she promises to make her payments on time and in the established period. Martha plans to use the loan to purchase more peas and all kinds of vegetables.

Mr. Santos would like to make improvements on his house, which would include changing the roof and the floor, but with what he makes at work he isn't able to reach that goal. This is why he is applying for a loan to buy metal sheeting, nails, flooring bricks, cement, and all of the materials necessary for the job. Over time his house has deteriorated and is now in very bad condition, and with these materials he hopes to be able to give his family a safer place to live.

","en":"Claudia is 29 years old and lives in the town of Puerto Colombia, located on the shore of the Caribbean and with great touristic potential.  She works there selling merchandise via specialized product catalogues, including cremes, colognes, perfumes, etc.  She began her enterprising experience two years ago when her sister, also a business woman, proposed that she dedicate herself to this work in order to generate income that would contribute to her household expenses. She lives with her life partner and their three children ages 4, 7, and 8.  In her business the principle products that she sells are body creams, colognes, perfume and general cosmetics.  Her products are sold on credit and for cash, every day, among friends, neighbors, and those referred by satisfied clients.  Claudia works daily from 8am to 8pm and she purchases her products with cash from businesses that distribute via catalog. Her goal is to open her own public shop and eventually have her own home.  For that reason she must increase her sales and generate greater income options, and for that reason she works constantly.  Currently she is applying for a kiva credit, her first loan from the foundation Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan she will buy perfume, cologne, cremes, and cosmetics, thereby offering a diverse array of products to her clients.  This will help her increase her income and achieve her dream of prosperity in the not so distant future.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1416578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase perfume, cologne, cremes and cosmetics.

Her dream is to have a staggered production that guarantees a stable monthly income and helps achieve a better quality of life for her family. \r\n\r\nShe is aware that she should continue to work diligently to achieve her goals, but this motivates her to apply for the loan.  This loan helps to purchase more pigs for fattening, which will increase production and the profit margin she makes on each sale.  This will help overcome their difficult economic situation because her husband was left without employment.  This way they can have better living conditions in the near future. \r\n

She grew up with her parents who worked growing organic cacao. She learned the family business since she and her siblings helped with the minor tasks. When she turned 24, Reyna had her first child and became independent from her parents. They gave her a small plot of land to work alongside her then husband. After her separation, Reyna decided to take on the beautiful responsibility of being father and mother for her small children, working the land that she had grown over time. She worked to be a great example of progress despite the difficulties of her life. Reyna considers the work she does very self-sacrificing. Every day she heads out to her land to maintain and care for her organic cacao plantations so that at the time of the harvest they will be high-quality ears and suitable seeds to sell to the merchants. On more than one occasion, Reyna has hired workers who help her with the complicated tasks such as pulling the weeds that grow constantly and breaking open the cacao pods to be dried in the open air. This is her first loan with Kiva and she feels grateful for the financial support she is receiving to get ahead. Also, she promises to make her monthly payments on time. With this opportunity, she hopes to receive 2,000 Nueves Soles to buy organic fertilizer and nourish her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1416621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-24T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-23T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":298.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":308.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":333.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":344.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":349.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":365.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.34,"local_amount":298.86,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":305.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865290},{"amount":111.94,"local_amount":308.8,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":315.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353664},{"amount":120.8,"local_amount":333.24,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":340.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905426},{"amount":124.77,"local_amount":344.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":352.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091414},{"amount":126.71,"local_amount":349.53,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":357.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778009},{"amount":132.44,"local_amount":365.36,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":373.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598403}],"funded_date":"2013-08-25T01:47:06Z","paid_date":"2014-02-25T09:46:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lindsay Dahlberg","image":null}},{"id":597017,"name":"Tupuka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tupuka is 20 years old, and with her partner, now has one child.

","en":"Nasrullo lives in Vahdat, Tajikistan.  He is 42 years old, married, and the father of three children.  He supports his family by providing taxi services on the Dushanbe - Khodja Obigarm route, completing one return trip per day.

Richar is sure of having a good harvest, allowing him to continue working so he can reach his goal of expanding his cropland."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1416643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To cover cost of irrigation, fertilizing and harvesting of his crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-08-24T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-23T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1425,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4020.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819606}],"funded_date":"2013-08-25T00:49:21Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T12:56:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":597080,"name":"Fofoga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fofoga is a 21-year-old woman who is single with no children.
