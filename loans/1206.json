For 12 years he has worked as an independent businessman along with his wife, thanks to which he has experience in the management and administration of different types of businesses. A year ago, he decided to move to a different neighborhood, and opened a grocery store in a part of his home. In this store, he sells dairy products, meat products, grains, snacks, soft drinks, baked goods, and other basics. The business has been very well received in the neighborhood due to the large variety of products on offer, as well as its location on a well-known street.\r\n\r\nErnesto is a determined and organized man who shows that his age won't stop him from working or feeling useful; on the contrary, he motivates himself every day to persevere and grow his business. For this reason, he is requesting this loan, which will be used to purchase supplies wholesale (grains, pasta, dairy, eggs, cleaning products, and more) which will allow him to have a greater variety of products to sell, thus increasing his customer base, his sales, and as a result, his income. This will help Ernesto to continue moving forward and achieve his dream of opening a small market where he can offer employment opportunities, increase his income, and enjoy economic stability and a better quality of life with his family."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1416726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies wholesale (grains, pasta, dairy, eggs, cleaning products, among others.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-24T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-23T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ernesto De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":59872},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":61524},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63221},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":64965},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":66758},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":68599},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":70492},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":72436},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":74435},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":76488},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":78598},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":80766},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":82995},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":85284},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87637},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":90055},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":92539},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":95092},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":97715},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100411},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":103181},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":106027},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":108952},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":111958}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deepti Limaye","image":1365774}},{"id":599340,"name":"Sara","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sara es una persona muy sencilla y agradable, es de la ciudad de Ybycui, un bello departamento, con lindas riquezas naturales.\nElla est\u00e1 estudiando la carrera de administraci\u00f3n de empresas, y comenta que se est\u00e1 esforzando al m\u00e1ximo por ser una buena profesional que sirva de ayuda a las dem\u00e1s personas.\nElla solicita de este cr\u00e9dito para poder invertirlo en el pago de sus cuotas y tambi\u00e9n para poder pagar sus clases de la universidad, lo que le ser\u00e1 de gran ayuda para seguir estudiando.\n","en":"Sara is modest and friendly.

Her husband works as a security staff person.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlba has been managing a bakery for 12 years.  She learned this type of work when she and her sister used a small oven for baking.  They made bread for household consumption.  Later on, Alba decided to make bread for the residents of her community in addition to her own family so that she could generate income.  Now her bread production has increased steadily and she has employees who live in the same community and work in the bakery.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy flour, sugar, yeast, eggs, and other supplies for making bread.  This enables her to provide daily sustenance for many people who must get up early in order to leave for work.

He is married but does not yet have any children. He is a farmer, who from a very young age has worked in agriculture, thanks to the traditions and teachings of his father. Currently he grows coffee beans, which are harvested and sold in the market place of the town where he lives. This way, he earns enough money to cover his household expenses. \r\n\r\nHe is a thriving and hard-working man who is passionate about his work, and despite the obstacles he faces due to his lack of capital to fertilize his crops, he always looks for a way to move forward.

Luego de culminar sus estudios secundarios y al cumplir la mayor\u00eda de edad, le fue f\u00e1cil conseguir empleo en el \u00e1rea comercial, gracias a su actitud creativa y esp\u00edritu emprendedor. Actualmente trabaja como asesora de telemercadeo en una empresa de call center. Pero con la necesidad de generar ingresos adicionales, encontr\u00f3 la oportunidad de montar su propio negocio de alquiler de video juegos por horas, aprovechando que en el sector donde reside no exist\u00eda este tipo de comercio. Luz es muy activa, en\u00e9rgica y trabajadora, pero ha tenido algunas dificultades con su negocio, pues \u00e9ste s\u00f3lo lo puede abrir a partir de las 5:00 pm, hora en la que culmina su jornada laboral en la empresa, generando un vac\u00edo que puede aprovechar otra persona para montar la competencia. Sin embargo, esto no la detiene, por el contrario se anima a seguir luchando para salir adelante. Por esta raz\u00f3n solicita su primer ciclo de cr\u00e9dito, con el fin de invertirlo en la compra de activos fijos (televisor y un play station) para acreditar a\u00fan m\u00e1s su negocio y poder suplir la demanda actual que posee, pues los clientes algunos d\u00edas deben hacer fila para poder acceder al servicio. Esto le ayudar\u00e1 a avanzar para cumplir el sue\u00f1o de independizarse completamente, pues espera que su negocio le genere los ingresos necesarios para apoyar a su esposo con la carga econ\u00f3mica del hogar y poder disfrutar de un futuro prometedor a mediano plazo.","en":"Luz, who is only 19 years old, lives in a common-law marriage with her partner. After finishing her secondary education and turning 18, it was easy for her to find employment in the business sector, thanks to her creative attitude and entrepreneurial spirit. Currently she works as a telemarketing consultant at a call centre company. But with the need to earn an additional income, she found the opportunity to start her own business renting video games by the hour, as in the area where she lives there is no other business like it.\r\n\r\nLuz is very active, energetic and hard-working, but she has had some difficulties with her business, as she can only open from 5 pm, when she finishes work at the call centre, leaving a gap that someone else could fill and create competition. However, this has not stopped her - on the contrary, she has decided to keep on fighting to get ahead. This is why she is asking for her first loan, with which she intends to buy fixed assets (a television and PlayStation) in order to consolidate her business and to be able to fulfil the current demand that is there, as some days clients have to queue in order to access the service.\r\n\r\nThis will help her get closer to achieving her dream of becoming completely independent, as she expects her business to generate enough income to help her husband with the household expenses and so be able to enjoy a promising future in the

This group consists of eight members and is led by a Board of Directors headed by Sra. Rufina as its president.  The members of this Communal Bank engage in various businesses such as selling plastics, selling lambs, selling flowers, operating a dairy, providing sound services, selling cheese and lamb meat, and producing jackets.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Sra. Rufina.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer a year and a half ago after receiving an invitation from a friend who is a member of the organization.  Rufina currently has a business of selling flowers.  She started this business years ago because she was already helping her mother with her business.  When she received her first loan, Rufina became independent and established her own business.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying flowers, which she acquires from the wholesale vendors.  She then sells her products from her retail space.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income so that she can support her family.  Rufina is married and has four children.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Rufina said that she enjoys working as part of a group.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3675,"image":{"id":1416534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy flowers to sell.

Her husband actively helps with the household. In search of a source of income for her family, Elmira started farming and raising animals in 2008. Having started with 10,000 som (KGS), today she earns a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS). She owns 1 milk cow and it's calf, and a 0.60 hectare parcel of land where she mostly grows peppers, cabbage, beans, and clover. In order to further develop her business, Elmira is asking the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 20,000 som (KGS) loan to buy fertilizer. Elmira plans to use the income from the loan to obtain more livestock, and she also intends to make repairs to her house.

Her husband helps her with the business. Eleonora provides the sole source on income for her family by fattening and selling livestock. She began doing this 20 years ago by spending 2,000 som (KGS) to buy animals. Thanks to her tireless work, Eleonora today owns seven horses, four cows, one heifer, one bull calf, and five sheep, and also has a 0.89 hectare land plot where she plants wheat each year. Her monthly income is 9,500 som (KGS). With the goal of further developing her business Eleonora is asking  the micro finance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a 70,000 som (KGS) loan to buy livestock for fattening and sale. She plants to invest the profit earned into further expanding her herd of livestock, and plans to save for the education of her younger children.

old, widowed, and has four children. She had a hard time after the death of her husband, but she gathered her strength and decided to keep going for her children. Of her children, her oldest daughter provides material help, since she sells groceries at the market. The rest of the children help around the property. Kaiyrkul provides the primary source of income for her family by raising and selling livestock. She started the business in 2008 by spending 25,000 som (KGS) on buying animals. Thanks to her tireless work and the active participation of her children, she now owns 2 bull calves and four sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further developing her business, Kaiyrkul is asking the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 70,000 som (KGS) loan for the purchase of calves for fattening and sale. She plans to invest income from the loan into further expanding her number of livestock, and she also plans to buy a sewing machine for the oldest daughter, who loves to sew.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1414283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":" Zokirjon is 47 years old. He lives in the Shahrituz Region. He is married and has two sons and one daughter. Zokirjon has a college degree. He is a professional accountant. At present Zokirjon intends to launch a retail business. He has built a store, 10x4 meters [about 33\u2019 x13\u2019 ], in his village and plans to sell groceries and household goods there. He has 1,500 USD remaining. This sum is insufficient to stock up merchandise for the shop. This is why Zokrijon turned to the MLO Humo for support. He plans to buy fresh quality groceries wholesale in the city of Dushanbe and bring them to his shop for retailing. He believes that his business will be successful because he will offer a wide selection of first necessity food items and household goods. He is counting on your support to open his store.

Grace is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kyenjojo in the Mubende region of Uganda. For the past two years, Grace has been working hard to manage her retail shop where she sells posho, rice, and sugar. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Grace has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase soap, posho, and rice for the shop to sell and will help Grace to generate greater profits and to boast the business. Grace hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy land and build a home. \r\n\r\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Moreen hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business and buy land. \r\n\r\nMoreen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1413514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups","Youth"],"use":"to purchase matooke, potatoes, and onions for her food stall business.

She is married and the mother of two grown sons. Tamar\u2019s retired sister-in-law lives with them. Tamar graduated from pedagogical college and works as a music teacher at the local music school. Tamar\u2019s young son is a cook at the restaurant and earns a small salary. Unfortunately, their income is too small and hardly enough to cover food and every day expenses for the family of five. \r\n\r\nSo, Tamar decided to start a clothing-trading business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Tamar\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, called the Startup Program that gives vulnerable poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of $600, she will purchase clothing at a wholesale price and sell them in her community door-to-door. Her regular customers will be her coworkers and neighbors.

She lives with her spouse who works as a driver for a private company and gets a monthly salary. Aza co-ordinates newspaper kiosks located in her town and earns a monthly salary as well. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her existing income is not enough to cover everyday costs and also help her children living in the village near the town where Aza lives. So, Aza decided to start a clothing trading business with a loan. But the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Aza\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received credit within the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Startup Program gives vulnerable poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.

In this way she has managed to obtain the resources to maintain her family and to face the monthly expenses that are unexpected.  She is a thriving woman, dedicated to her work and her family, who works arduous hours daily in order to get ahead.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is asking for a loan in order to invest in the purchase of a specialized sewing machine (an overstiching machine) and in this way she will be able to complete her products on time and sell them at a better price, since her pieces will be finished well and will have great quality to satisfy the needs of her customers.  That will then be reflected in her sales and income.

Beka is an assistant of the operator at the local asphalt factory and gets a monthly income. His parents run an agricultural business and grow peaches in their garden. They also graft the plants and sell them in the capital city open market and also sell picked peaches. \r\n\r\nBeka requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up, but had no success. His loan request was rejected because of his low income and lack of experience in the new business. Recently, Beka requested credit from Credo. He was planning to start-up the animal husbandry business. His loan request was approved, through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with soft conditions to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to mainstream credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers,\u201d due to low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Beka will purchase several calves. He will keep the cattle in the shed located in his yard, raise and sell them over five to six months. After selling the calves, he will purchase more of them and go through the same cycle.

She doesn\u2019t take care of additional family members. She has a pub business and has been in this business for four years. She has applied for a loan of 200, 000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy more crates of beer, soda, and jerry-cans of local gin. She generates additional income from selling green bananas.

She also takes care of additional family members. She resides in a rented house, and the family has access to electricity not to piped water. Her monthly expenses include school fees and rent. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the past year Sarah has operated a business selling used clothes, her sole source of income.

The members of this Communal Bank engage in various businesses such as making rugs, selling food, selling clothes, selling wool, making rope, selling meat, selling \u201cap\u00ed\u201d (a beverage made from corn), and selling cosmetics.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Sra. Modesta.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer seven months ago after receiving an invitation from a promoter from the organization who visited her at her house.  Modesta currently has a business of making and selling sweatshirts and stockings.  She started this business on her own after noticing that there was a demand for these products.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying wool, which she will acquire from the wholesale vendors in the city of El Alto.  She will then use this material for making the products she sells from her retail space.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income for supporting her family.  Modesta is married and has two children.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Modesta said that she enjoys working in a group and with the advisors.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":1416531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wool for making stockings and sweatshirts.

for the past three years.  She offers a variety of grocery items at a reasonable price and has retained many customers who regularly shop at her store. She makes enough to provide for her family.

She has been a rice farmer for the past thirty years. With the Kiva loan, she would like to buy more fertilizers for use during rice production.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Her main business now is in mosaic and faux-bijoux handicraft work. \r\nHer husband, a blacksmith, works to earn daily wages and has a fluctuating income.\r\n\r\nHanaa has benefited from financial and non-financial services from Al Majmoua since 2008. She was also chosen by Al Majmoua to attend the \"1st Euromed Forum of Women Micro-entrepreneurship\" which took place in Strasbourg in November 2008 to link women from Arabic Mediterranean countries, build a network and test the European market responsiveness to handicraft products from the Arab countries.\r\n\r\nThe forum helped Hanaa to increase her self confidence as she met people from different cultures, and exchanged experiences and new skills with other micro-entrepreneurs. Hanaa also received a great testimony of appreciation of her mosaic work from customers: they were impressed with the high quality of professionalism in her work. \r\n\r\nHanaa took two loans from Al Majmoua to purchase a ceramic stone-cutting machine and some other work materials. This machine allowed Hana to save 50% on the cost of raw materials and 30% on her time. She previously had to rent one for USD 100 per day.\r\n\r\nShe has also benefited from many training opportunities from Al Majmoua and was able to become a vocational trainer for her peers in the community. She trains other women to acquire new skills and start a new business. \r\n\r\nHanaa is very satisfied with what she has learned and accomplished. She feels more confident as she proves herself by participating more and more in the budget and decision-making of her family. \r\n\r\nUnlike her previous loans, Hanna is acquiring a third loan cycle

The profits from the rice will be used to help to sustain the family's needs.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is a single mother of two children with whom she lives in one of her brother\u2019s rental units in the outskirts of the city. She operates a food business from her home. This has helped her be able to take care of her children and educate them. Besides looking after her children, she has also managed to buy a small piece of land.

She works at the business throughout the week, from morning until night. At present her major problem is the slow purchasing power of customers.\r\n\r\nAbibatu has requested a loan in order to buy more food commodities like palm oil, rice and cooking oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her family's living conditions. In the future, she plans to educate her children up to the university level.

edad, actualemente vive junto a su c\u00f3nyuge, su hijo y su nuera en su casa propia. Gunter, se dedica a la venta de productos regionales, tiene un terreno agr\u00edcola en donde siembra diversos cultivos como coco, naranja, limones y distintas frutas tropicales que cosecha cada dos d\u00edas y que posteriormente pone a la venta de forma ambulatoria en el mercado principal de la ciudad. En \u00e9pocas de baja producci\u00f3n la cosecha es semanal y en ese per\u00edodo realiza otras funciones para asegurar su solvencia econ\u00f3mica. Lleva en esta actividad m\u00e1s de 02 a\u00f1os y le va muy  bien. Trabaja con la ayuda de su esposa quien le apoya en las ventas y en la atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes.  Por las noches trabaja como guardi\u00e1n de una ganader\u00eda que le genera un ingreso econ\u00f3mico adicional.Est\u00e1 muy contento porque ambas actividades le est\u00e1n dando buenos resultados, anteriormente su mayor problema era la dificultad que ten\u00eda para trasladar sus productos a la ciudad debido a las malas condiciones de la carretera, adem\u00e1s la ausencia de mano de obra en su sector no le permit\u00eda realizar la cosecha en el tiempo previsto, sin embargo todas esas condiciones han mejorado y ahora trabaja adecuadamente y con mejores resultados. Este es su sexto pr\u00e9stamo con Kiva y se siente agradecido por el apoyo financiero que recibe para seguir adelante, adem\u00e1s se compromete a pagar sus cuotas de manera puntual. El monto solicitado 800 soles, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de distintos productos regionales como yuca, pl\u00e1tano y carnes de animales silvestres ya que ha visto que tienen gran demanda entre la poblaci\u00f3n y no cuenta con estos productos en su terreno agr\u00edcola.\n","en":"Gunter is 58 years old and married to Maria.  They have eight adult children.  [Gunter] currently lives with his wife, his son, and daughter in law.  He sells regional products, and has farmland where he raises different crops such as coconuts, oranges, lemons, and different tropical fruits that he harvests every two days and then sells in the main city market.\r\n\r\nIn times of low production, he harvests once a week and does other things to ensure financial solvency.  He has been doing this for more than two years and things are going well for him.  His wife helps with sales and serving customers.  In the evenings he works as a security guard for a day care center, which generates additional income.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy because both activities are providing him with good results.

This is why she has asked for funding through COMIXMUL in order to buy 8 bags of nutr\u00ed caf\u00e9, 7 bags of 18-46-0 compost, 6 bags of urea, 7 bags of foliar compost and 3 liters of ALTO 10 SL with which to keep her harvest safe and healthy.\r\n\r\nHer goal in the long run is to expand her coffee crops by buying more land, growing a variety of coffee to be more competitive and improving her growing techniques.\r\n\r\nHer dream is through her income to provide her family with a better quality of life and offer better study opportunities than she had when she was a youth so that she can send her children to university so they can gain advantages."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1417153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies for her coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1250,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25487.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530535570}],"funded_date":"2013-09-04T05:02:24Z","paid_date":"2014-09-19T09:53:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":599724,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a motorcycle.

Later on, she was able to benefit from financial support from Hekima's microloan program. She has been carrying out this business for around 12 years.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Her daughters and sons are married. Khaliskhan's eldest son has a disability. \r\n\r\nKhaliskhan has higher pedagogical education. For a period of 30 years she worked as a teacher at the local school, relentlessly bringing up the younger generation. Khaliskhan is known as a principal, honest and good-hearted person. Her long experience and dedication to her work earned Khaliskhan great respect among the villagers. \r\n\r\nWhen retiring, Khaliskhan decided to not sit back, and since 2003, searching for a source of income for her family, she started her business of livestock breeding on her farm, and also doing field crop cultivation. After having started with 6,000 som (KGS), her business currently brings in a monthly income in the amount of 8,000 som (KGS). Khaliskhan has two dairy cows with offspring on her farm. She also has a plot of land of 0.51 hectares, where she mainly grows potato, onion, peppers and sweet corn. Khaliskhan invested the income from the business in increasing the number of cattle on her farm. \r\n\r\nTo further develop her business, Khaliskhan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cows. Khaliskhan plans to spend the income from the loan on increasing the number of cattle, and in the future she also intends to purchase an apartment for her son.

This way her and her family can prepare food properly, so Techy can continue working and flighting to achieve her big dream of becoming a professional."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1417197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a kitchen.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Techy Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":65.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":74.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":78.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":80.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.81},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":89.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":91.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":95.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":98.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":103.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.56,"local_amount":65.49,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":69.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779474},{"amount":25.58,"local_amount":68.22,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":71.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054722},{"amount":54.88,"local_amount":146.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":154.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472538},{"amount":59.49,"local_amount":158.62,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":167.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450391042},{"amount":31.43,"local_amount":83.81,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":88.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880440},{"amount":33.48,"local_amount":89.28,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":94.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479103999},{"amount":34.14,"local_amount":91.04,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:07:28Z","rounded_local_amount":96.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490799081},{"amount":35.72,"local_amount":95.26,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":100.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504222147},{"amount":37.06,"local_amount":98.83,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":104.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517510053},{"amount":38.66,"local_amount":103.1,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":108.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542485411}],"funded_date":"2013-08-27T20:24:50Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:09:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Clare Hearty","image":null}},{"id":599249,"name":"Manuel Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Manuel, a sus 33 a\u00f1os, vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su pareja y no tiene hijos.

She lives in the Caldwell area in Montserrado County, which is becoming one of the most populated communities in Montserrado because of its good roads, quietness, and lower rents. Bendu is 25 years old. She is married and has an 8-year-old child, who stays at home and attends school. Her husband is a driver. She runs a table at which she sells soft drinks and biscuits. \r\n\r\nBendu is asking for a loan to buy enough soft drinks and biscuits to increase her sales. She reports that lack of funds is the major problem she faces now; she started this business with a little money from her husband. Bendu enjoys her business because she earns her own money, and she is so proud of her business because it makes her independent. Her plan is to one day own a house, and see her child attend university. She appreciates the supporters of BRAC Liberia.

He has a partner who is also a farmer and three children who are all adults. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, he sows corn, sorghum and beans, which he grows in the rainy season. In the dry season he carries out other activities such as for example: rearing pigs, which gives him other sources of income.\r\n\r\nHe has been a farmer since he was 12 years old.

Her husband and her youngest son help her with her business. As the main income for her family, Orozbubu works with fattening calves for further reselling, after having started 20 years ago with purchasing cattle for 6,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Orozbubu's persistent work, her farm currently has three cows, two calves, 40 sheep and also a plot of land of 2.0 hectares. There she plants barley and hay every year. The monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Orozbubu turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partner\" for a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) for purchasing calves for fattening and reselling. Orozbubu plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock, and plans to save up money for her youngest son's marriage."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1414403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves for fattening and reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chekilden village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orozbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":623.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":830.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":830.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":599753,"name":"Zaida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zaida, de 56 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada con Cesar de 57 a\u00f1os y tiene 6 hijos, durante mucho tiempo se esforz\u00f3 arduamente junto a su pareja para brindar una buena educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos, actualmente vive junto a su esposo, dos hijos, su nuera y su nieta en su casa propia.

two sons, who are 11 and 7 years old. She is the woman standing on the far left in the photograph.  \r\n\r\nEunice has been selling frozen chicken, pig feet, and cooking utensils for thirteen years with the help of her husband. She started the business with a low profile, selling just cooking utensils, but gradually she expanded. Eunice needs an amount of GHS 1200 to buy a deep freezer so that she can store her chicken and pig feet. Through her last six loans from ID-Ghana and the support of her husband, she has grown her business year after year. She now earns GHS 400 month from her business, but that is not sufficient for her to manage it. \r\n\r\nEunice dreams of providing better education for her two children. With this loan, she expects to increase her sales, and that income will help ensure their education and welfare. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of her group are Diana, Charllote, Tsotsoo, and Patience, who run businesses in fish, provisions, detergent, maize, and ladies footwear,

Two of her children are currently in school, while one is still young to attend school; they all live at home.\r\n\r\nFor three years Maima has been selling fashion-slippers in the local market, where she enjoys the location of her business since its situated in a very good position not far from the road. She has many customers and the need for her products is very high, although sometimes business is slow. Most of  the time she makes good money.\r\n\r\nMaima is requesting a loan to purchase more fashion-slippers to sell; this will enable her to earn more money since the demand from her customers is very high. \r\n\r\nIn the future she plans to expand her business and build a

She lives in the Caldwell area in Montserrado County, which is becoming one of the most populated communities in Montserrado because of its good roads, quietness, and lower rents. Juah is married with three children, who are between the ages of 2 and 16 years old, and who live at home and attend school. \r\n\r\nFor the past seven years, she has been selling palm oil, pepper, onion, and other items in the local market, where she works ten hours a day from Monday through Saturday. One of her main challenges is that sometimes the prices for her goods drop after she purchases them. Juah is requesting a loan to purchase more palm oil, pepper, onion, and other items for her business. She hopes to one day build a house for her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1413804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is the leader of a group consisting of eight micro-entrepreneurs from Brazzaville, Congo. Patrick is married with a total of eight children! They range in age from 4 to 18 years old. This is Patrick's very first loan cycle with HOPE Congo and he is looking forward to expanding his shop and business, which he has been running since 2003. Patrick says his biggest challenge so far is the increasing prices that he must pay for the inventory for his store and states that this loan will help to reinforce the total capital of his business. Patrick also loves to talk about Jesus with other people in his community and his loan group.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Patrick hopes to continue to grow his activities so that he can increase his current shop and ultimately to become a successful businessman in Brazzaville. He would love for his future business to provide him with the opportunity to travel abroad to other countries."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":1413929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase inventory to sell including soap, milk, corned beef, and candy ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T21:00:08Z","loan_amount":4900,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Garcia Lydwine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cedric","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Augustine Aimelie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flore Sylvie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gery Chrisostome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sidonie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anifride","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick Torendel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":137300},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":139200},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140800},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":142600},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":144000},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":146100},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":147400},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":149000},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150900},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":152300},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":154400},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":156200},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":157800},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159700},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":161800},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":326.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":330.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2036.36,"local_amount":997400,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1001777.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410109335},{"amount":1238.47,"local_amount":606600,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":609262.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874208},{"amount":1297.48,"local_amount":635500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":638289.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429522862},{"amount":327.69,"local_amount":160500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":161204.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439746783}],"funded_date":"2013-08-31T18:42:15Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:34:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":597447,"name":"Oretha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Oretha from Liberia.

This is Cesar's very first loan cycle with HOPE Congo and he is going to use his loan to purchase a used vehicle that he will disassemble for used parts to resell to his customers. One of the challenges that Cesar faces since he started his business in 2004 is that often his customers are looking for unique items to purchase from his store and it is difficult to find the necessary stock when customers ask for parts. The purchase of the vehicle will allow him to offer more parts, especially unique parts, to his clients. In the future, Cesar hopes to continue to grow his activities and diversify into activities other than spare vehicle parts. Additionally, the increased income that he hopes to earn from his business will be put towards constructing a new home for him and his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4800,"image":{"id":1413948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase a previously used car to use as additional spare parts for his store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T21:10:06Z","loan_amount":4800,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"St\u00e8ve Pichastre","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seraphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miakakela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stetieiene Avertie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henriette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":2350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":134600},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":135900},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":139100},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140600},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":142800},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":144200},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":145800},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":147500},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":149000},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150800},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":152400},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":154400},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":156100},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":157900},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":161400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.12},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":301.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":311.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1990.88,"local_amount":974700,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":979403.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410109336},{"amount":1211.43,"local_amount":593100,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":595961.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874209},{"amount":1268.02,"local_amount":620800,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":623795.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429522863},{"amount":329.67,"local_amount":161400,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":162178.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439746784}],"funded_date":"2013-09-04T23:13:59Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:34:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":597452,"name":"Finda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Finda from Liberia.

years old. Four of her children attend school and her husband pays their tuition. She is the woman standing at the far left in the first row of the photograph. Maria has worked as a farmer for the last 15 years, which is her major source of income supporting her family. She also operates a small retail shop at home to add to her earnings.\r\n\r\nMaria has applied for a loan of 600,000 Ugandan shillings for her farming activities, which she will use to buy mulch for her banana plantation and pay workers to plow it.

They have four children between the ages of 18 and 25 years. Four of their children live at home and currently attend school. For more than fourteen years, Sara has sold used clothes in the local market, where she works ten hours per day Monday to Saturday. Her main challenge is that she started the business during the rainy season, but she has earned some profit. Sara learned the business from her friends, and started it with money from her husband. \r\n\r\nSara is requesting a loan to purchase more used clothes for her business.

the meaning of her name implies, is always smiling, kind and friendly.  She works as a seamstress.  She sews beautiful traditional Tajik dresses for women.  She is also a skilled embroiderer and she creates various patterns with beads, making decorative flower patterns to embellish her dresses.  She has a certain number of customers, whom she is always happy to serve.  She mainly sews at home, having transformed a small room into a studio which has become her world of art and where she creates beautiful dresses, giving life to her fabrics.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her talent as a seamstress, Hursand is a loving mother.  Her children are already grown-ups.  Her oldest son left for Russia to make a living and sends money home every month.  Hursand is now responsible not only for her own family, but also for her son's family.  As a caring mother and grandmother, her strongest desire is to see her children happy and she does everything to make this happen.\r\n\r\nHursand wants to repair the house where her large family lives.  However, the money that she makes thanks to her sewing business is not sufficient to perform home repairs.  This is the reason why she has turned to MDO Arvand, requesting a loan to buy building materials for the renovation of her house.  She hopes to receive some support from MDO Arvand and Kiva, and she thanks her lenders in advance for their help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1414442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hursand","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":58},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":60.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":64.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":67.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":72.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.43},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58,"local_amount":58,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136795},{"amount":59.45,"local_amount":59.45,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":59.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900993},{"amount":60.94,"local_amount":60.94,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":60.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550175},{"amount":62.46,"local_amount":62.46,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774397},{"amount":64.02,"local_amount":64.02,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":64.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673530},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":65.62,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":65.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144318},{"amount":67.26,"local_amount":67.26,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":67.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960140},{"amount":362.25,"local_amount":362.25,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":362.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180908}],"funded_date":"2013-09-24T19:49:04Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":599674,"name":"Julio Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio, se le presenta la necesidad de optar por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo porque requiere agregar el rubro de venta de mariscos, ya que se lo administrara su cu\u00f1ado, adem\u00e1s adquirir algunas herramientas para la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda; esta inversi\u00f3n le ayudara a comprar pescado, camar\u00f3n, conchas; tambi\u00e9n una cuchara para trabajar en construcci\u00f3n.\nEl cr\u00e9dito anterior fue positivo, ya que logro completar la comprar de  un veh\u00edculo  y algunos repuestos.

He is married and has three children. \r\n\r\nAs his neighbors say, Tursun is successful, conscientious, honest, and dedicated. Tursun works a lot to provide consistent income for his family. For that reason, he runs his own business. Actually, he runs two businesses simultaneously. At first, he started with a small business fattening and reselling cattle. Now, he has grown his business so much that he raises his own cattle. Income from his business has been good, but he got the idea to grow his own crops to reduce spending by feeding this cattle home-grown feed.\r\n\r\nBy now, Tursun has a large harvest and a large amount of feed for cattle. Because of this, it is now necessary to increase the number of cattle. For this, Tursun applied for a loan from Arvand to buy a few additional cattle. The loan will help him grow his business and increase his family's income. Tursun is grateful to Arvand for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2950,"image":{"id":1397610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She is married and has two children aged 20 and 18. In 2002, she started a business in cow's milk sales. Working seven days a week and four hours a day, she supports her family.\r\n\r\nMuya has already received and successfully repaid six loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy a young dairy cow. Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.\r\nOn average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 litres of milk each day. In the local market, a litre of milk sells for about USD $0.40. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Muya plans to improve the economic conditions of her family.

She has five years of experience in her line of work, which is making and selling tortillas.  She has partially completed her education.  She lives in a common-law relationship, and her partner works in an automotive repair shop.  They have 2 dependant children who are aged 5 and one, and who are not yet in school.  She owns a business that sells tortillas, which is an activity that she learned from her mother.  She decided to start her business out of a need to support and educate her children.  She works out of her home so that she does not pay taxes, and together with her life partner she is thinking about increasing her income.  The loan that she is requesting is to buy corn and have a reserve supply, because it is bought by the pound, and by buying wholesale she can improve her earnings.  In addition to this she will buy firewood and other supplies that she needs to expand her business.  She hopes that this will result in better earnings and an improvement in her quality of life, as she can acquire better housing.
