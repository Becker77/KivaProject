","en":"Ranojon was born and raised in a rural area. She is a very harworking woman, as she helped her parents around the house and in the fields since childhood. Ranojon is 42 years old, married, and has three children. Her husband is a rural doctor. She gets along well with her husband - they understand each other. They try to work together to provide themselves and their children with all their needs. They have a very friendly, hardworking, and joyful family. The parents' actions provide an example for the children. \r\n\r\nTo help her husband earn money, Ranojon began her own small business, which she is gradually expanding. She has a small store near her house, where she sells groceries. In rural areas there is a lot of work to do in the summer: everyone goes out to the fields in the morning and returns in the evening. The location of Ranojon's store is convenient for her neighbors, and they are happy with it. \r\n\r\nRanojon would now like to expand her business to earn a larger income. She wants to expand the types of goods she has on the shelves. To do this she came to Arvand and would like a loan to buy groceries for future sale. Ranojon hopes for good results, and thanks you in advance for the financial support. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1411951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ranojon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":364.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":376.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":387.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":399.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":412.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":424.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":437.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":451.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":465.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":479.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":494.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":509.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":525.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":541.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":558.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":575.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":594.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":597683,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is married with 5 children.

He is married and has two children. He and his wife are happy together - he loves her and their children very much. Hafizullo has a military university education, and he works as an officer in a military unit. He earns a good stable income. Hafizullo is a good and responsible man. His wife does not work, as she stays home to care for their children, and always has a lot to do since they live in a rural area. Since they live a bit far from the city, transportation is often difficult for Hafizullo. He has long wanted to buy his own car, but he hasn't yet been able to accumulate enough money. The salary he earns from his work mostly goes toward feeding the family, so it is hard to save money to buy consumer goods and more expensive items. Hafizullo decided to take out a loan for consumer goods. He came to Arvand and is requesting a loan to buy a car. Having his own car will make transportation much easier. Hafizullo is thankful to Arvand for the financial support. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1410025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T02:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T02:00:07Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hafizullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":115.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":118.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":121.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":127.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":131.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":134.61},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":138.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":141.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":145.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":149.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":152.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":597692,"name":"Emelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emelita is 53 years old and married with 4 children, two of whom are in school.

She is divorced and has two children. She is a very hard-working woman. As a child she always stayed near her mother and learned all the household activities from her. Her mother also taught her to sew. Unfortunately Rukya was not able to go to college because of her family's financial hardship. However, she was able to learn sewing well, and now that is her primary business, and earns her a good income. Rukya is a dressmaker and seamstress. She has many regular clients. This work supports her and feeds her family. She dreams of having a good home so that the family could live better and more comfortably. The house where she lives now is not in good condition, so Rukya would like to do some remodeling. She is planing to do major repairs, but she needs a lot of money, and what she has from her business is only enough for food. Because of that, she decided to apply a loan for the repairs. To do that she came to Arvand and is hoping to receive a loan for building materials. She hopes for and believes that she will have good results, and she thanks Arvand in advance for the support. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1410385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rukiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":489.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":505.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":522.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":540.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":558.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":577.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":597.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":617.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":638.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":660.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":682.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":705.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":729.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":754.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":780.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":806.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":832.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":597690,"name":"Anabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anabel is 42 years old and married with four children, three of whom are in school.

She is divorced from her husband and has one son. Her son is currently in Russia, where he works at a construction site and receives a good income which he sends each month to his mother. Mujibakhon is trying to raise her son to be a \r\nworthy man and does not want him to lack anything he needs. Because of this she herself works to earn money. She works on a farm, which earns her a small income. She has been dreaming for a long time of having a comfortable house where she can live with her son and his wife. Her house needs major repairs, and Mujibakhon would like to do a good remodeling, but she will need a lot of money to do it. The income that she and her son earn cannot cover all expenses and it would take a long time to save the needed sum.

She and her husband are raising four children.  She has a secondary education and works as an orderly at the local hospital.  Her husband is employed by the same hospital and works as a gardener.  Toktokan's oldest son is married and making a living in Moscow.  He helps his parents financially, sending them money every month in Kyrgyzstan.  The couple's other children are still in school.\r\n\r\n(In addition to her hospital job), Toktokan is also involved in animal husbandry, which provides her family with an additional source of income.  She started in this business 20 years ago using an initial capital of 10,000 som (KGS)  to buy livestock.  Thanks to her hard work and to the support of her close-knit family, Toktokan now owns one horse as well as 15 head of small livestock, and she makes a monthly income of 3,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her animal husbandry business, she has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to increase her herd by purchasing one head of cattle.  She plans to invest her earnings from this loan into further increasing her livestock headcount.  She is also planning to save enough money for her son's wedding ceremony."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1415020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulcha village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Toktokan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2832},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2915},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3087},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3177},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3270},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3366},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3464},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3565},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3669},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3776},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3879}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.61},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":122.12,"local_amount":5747,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5920.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014111},{"amount":63.75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3090.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777176},{"amount":65.6,"local_amount":3087,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3180.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427010},{"amount":71.84,"local_amount":3380.59,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3482.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553065},{"amount":133.75,"local_amount":6432.41,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6626.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.94,"payment_id":459019508},{"amount":73.61,"local_amount":3464,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3568.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053270},{"amount":75.76,"local_amount":3565,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3672.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749423},{"amount":77.96,"local_amount":3669,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3779.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178150},{"amount":80.24,"local_amount":3776,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3890.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462779},{"amount":81.5,"local_amount":3879,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3996.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.93,"payment_id":529946779}],"funded_date":"2013-09-13T16:58:13Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":597669,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is 53 years old and lives in Catarman, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental.

Her oldest son sells cell-phones.  Her other two children are still in school.\r\n\r\n(In addition to her teacher's job), Kimsan is also involved in animal husbandry, which provides her family with an additional source of income.  She started in this business 15 years ago, using 16,000 som (KGS) to buy some livestock.  Thanks to her hard work and to the support of her family, she now owns two cows and 20 head of smaller livestock, and she makes a monthly income of 6,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her animal husbandry business, she has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to increase her herd by purchasing some cows.  She plans to invest her earnings from this loan into further increasing her livestock

Engaged in her current business for ten years, Sophy is able to earn about 24,000 KHR per day.  \r\n\r\nSophy is a fifth-time borrower and her fellow group member is a first-cycle client with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

They have been blessed with four sons: Victor, a 30-year-old policeman; Frangky, a 25-year-old entrepreneur; James, a 23-year-old college student; and Mario, a 20-year-old who graduated from high school.\r\n\r\nMarselina initiated a pig-breeding business in 2009. Nowadays, she has three pigs. These pigs bear three times a year, and commonly a pig brings forth 10-12 piglets per birthing. Usually she sells the piglets in the amount of 750,000 IDR (Indonesian rupiah) each. The income from the business enables her to support the needs of her family, as her husband has gone through an early retirement because of sickness. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Marselina desires to raise more piglets, which means that she needs more stock of fodder. Her lack of money has led her to ask for an individual loan from TLM in amount of 10,000,000 IDR. The loan will be spent on the fodder, and to pay her son's school fee. She hopes that the loan will help her to be successful in her business.

She lives with her husband and children in a rented house in Amman. Her husband retired and is currently working as a security guard which is a weak source of income to cover their children's needs. Asefa has 3 sons and 3 daughters. She started her project by visiting her friend in Aqaba which is a city in Jordan. From there she bought clothes and started trading them for the last 6 years. She has been facing an obstacle in her project which is having many competitors in the same area.

Janargul raises livestock, which is the family's main source of income.  She started this business 12 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 16,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to the hard work of Janargul and her family, her farm now has two cows and 15 sheep and goats, which bring in a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Janargul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to increase her head of livestock by purchasing sheep and goats.  She plans to use the income from this loan to increase her head of livestock, and she also plans on saving up money to buy a car."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1415027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Jilga village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T13:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T13:20:04Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janargul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":840}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":205.72,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":10181.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.28,"payment_id":467830876},{"amount":830.53,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":40724.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.47,"payment_id":529946782}],"funded_date":"2013-09-24T20:21:26Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":597777,"name":"Elpedia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elpedia is a 49-year-old married woman and a mother of three children.

","en":"Saadatkan is 51 years old and widowed.  Since the death of her husband, she has been taking care of three children and running the household by herself.  Saadatkan has a high school education and works in the local school as a caretaker.  To earn extra money for her family, she also raises livestock, which she started doing 10 years with the purchase of animals for 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Saadatkan's hard work, her farm now has three horses and 15 head of sheep and goats, which bring in a monthly income of 6,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Saadatkan has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to increase her head of livestock by purchasing sheep and goats.  She plans to use the income from this loan to make her herd even greater, and she also plans to save up money to make repairs on her

Thanks to her hard work, her farm now has three horses and 15 head of sheep. The business earns 6000 som (KGS) per month. With the goal of expanding her business, Ibadat turned to the Microlending bank Bai-Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 1000,000 som (KGS) to increase her livestock herd by purchasing more sheep and horses. Ibadat plans to invest the proceeds from the loan into increasing her livestock herd, and plans to save money to repair her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1415032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is the featured borrower member for Thoibi SHG.  \r\n\r\nShe lives 35 kms away from the heart of the city of Imphal in the northeastern part of India. Her husband is a social worker who earns a meager income that could not meet the basic essential needs of the family. So in order to generate more income, Sundari got engaged in a small-scale weaving business and also sells  food supplements. As a registered agent, she gets the supplies at a subsidized rate. Door to door selling is profitable, says Sundari.  \r\n\r\nShe weaves traditional women's wrap-around skirts and sells them to the women vendors in the capital market. The demand for the finished woven product is high during festive season, which is usually fall to winter. The failure to deliver the woven products on time disappointed a number of buyers in the previous season as she could not afford to get sufficient weaving materials due to a shortage of money. So she wanted to take the help of Kiva to improve her business. She aspires to become the most successful woven product supplier in the town. She thanks Kiva for being the source of help in times of need.  \r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are all engaged in weaving.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1414406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase different types of yarn, thread and silk for weaving.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pishakmacha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sundari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sangbanabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asharani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aruna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-27T21:11:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":598899,"name":"Kayi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Kayi \u00e2g\u00e9e de 38ans est revendeuse.

She is a pensioner and has a high school education.  Three of her children are migrant workers in Russia and they help Kaliya by sending money home, and her youngest son lives with his mother and actively helps her around the house.  As the main source of income for her family, Kaliya raises livestock, which she started doing 20 years ago by purchasing livestock for 15,000 som KGS.  Thanks to the hard work of Kaliya and her youngest son, their farm now has one dairy cow and 20 head of sheep and goats, which bring in a monthly income of 3,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Kaliya has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 20,000 som (KGS) to increase her head of livestock by buying sheep and goats.

She has a high school education.  After she finished school, Burulkan married at a very young age.  Since 1993, she has been farming and raising livestock, a business she started with 20,000 som KGS.  Her husband is a shepherd, driving herds for the other residents in their village.  Thanks to her hard work, Burulkan now has a good farm with two dairy cows, 20 sheep and three horses.  The income from the farm has allowed Burulkan to increase the herd on her farm and to improve her family's well-being.  With the goal of developing her business further, Burulkan has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 110,000 som (KGS) to buy cows.  She plans to use the income from this business to increase her herd even more, and she plans to save up some money for her daughter's college

She and her husband work together to cultivate and farm potatoes and other vegetables. Her husband has taught her many farming techniques, and they presently farm a parcel of land 10 minutes from their home that was passed down to them by her husband's parents. Their family of four lives together, since their two children are very young and not yet in school. Nelda was able to complete three years of her high school education before children and household responsibilities became her top priorities.\r\n\r\nWith the support from this loan, Nelda plans to purchase agricultural input products for her farming operation, including manure, ammonium nitrate, potato seeds and other items. She hopes that this investment will help her to expand her farming operation, increase her customer base and generate more income to support her family. \r\n\r\nHer future plans are to add a room on to her family's home to improve their quality of life and security. Her dream is to send her children to university so they can pursue professional careers and improve their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1415664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase agricultural inputs for tending her potato crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelda Nohemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1.38,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":28.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070303},{"amount":298.62,"local_amount":5972.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6088.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042199}],"funded_date":"2013-08-26T17:55:32Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":597846,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase soft drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T15:20:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.38,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":336.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410549873},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":168.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429486103},{"amount":155.83,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T09:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":336.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.51,"payment_id":440340805},{"amount":8.93,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.59,"payment_id":450236450}],"funded_date":"2013-09-15T21:24:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":597844,"name":"Hamza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamza is an Iraqi client who is 42 years old, married and the father of five children.

He can\u2019t find an appropriate and moneymaking job to generate an income. The family lives below the poverty line and gets a small social assistance from the local government (nearly 33 USD per month). \r\n\r\nAs the family has many expenses and existing funds are not enough to cover them, Lasha decided to start a business. He requested credit to set up a cobbler shop. Lasha used to work as a cobbler and has enough experience in this field. \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lasha will purchase leather materials and all the needed tools for shoe-making. He will also repair shoes and get a profit. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income for the family. Their living conditions will improve, and in the future they will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

She is the leader of the group, comprised of eight micro-entrepreneurs from Brazzaville, Congo. Jeanine is married and has four children, one of whom is currently in school. She also cares for two other children that are members of her household.\r\n\r\nThis is Jeanine's second loan cycle with HOPE Congo. She is going to use her share of this loan to purchase additional stock of used clothing for her store. She also makes fresh doughnuts and cold drinks for her customers who come to purchase clothes.

Her husband passed away when her child was only one and a half years old. Her daughter stays with her husband\u2019s family and Hevei returned to her parents' house. She is the featured borrower member for Dry-Flower group and she is pictured on the extreme left with her hand raised. Most of the members in their group are divorcees, single or widows. They joined the group to support one another financially and technically. All members live closed to one another in the same region which is about 40 kms far from the main capital town of Imphal, which is one of the capital states in North-Eastern India.\r\n\r\nHevei is a talented weaver and her finished products are highly in demand. She usually receives orders from neighbours and neighbouring villagers. Most of the time she fails to deliver them as she weaves with the traditional backstrap loom. Weaving with the help of the traditional back strap loom is time-consuming and tiring. Hevei generally receives a depository amount from those who placed an order and purchases the yarn and thread from the main market in the city. Once the piece is finished, she gets the full amount.  Her sister also helps her in weaving and both of them generate income for the family. \r\n\r\nThe inability to put aside saving has immensely paralyzed her and made it difficult to efficiently work on her weaving activity. There are times when Hevei does not have enough money to purchase the yarn as most of her income is expended on her nieces and nephews educational fees. Her late brother had left his kids in her responsibility and she tries hard in all possible ways to manage. The demand is high during the wedding season; the bride generally takes several traditional wrap-around skirts along with her. The wedding season starts in the month of October and lasts till late April. \r\n\r\nHevei wants a loan from Kiva to purchase different types of yarn and thread and keep them in stock so as to start weaving before the wedding season begins. She aspires to become the most successful weaver and highest supplier in the town. She says she will work hard and ceaselessly continue striving to get a loom and construct a separate chamber for weaving purposes. The joy is heard when she shares her plans and how she will work in future. She thanked Kiva and WSDS for everything and says \u201cGod Bless Kiva!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving, or piggery and vegetable selling businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1406448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more yarn and thread items for weaving different designs so as to earn more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T17:20:37Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T17:20:37Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hevei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoishi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkhochin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneinem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkhotin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-29T13:25:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":597906,"name":"Nagina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nagina is a 48-year-old, married woman.

To feed his family, he practices dairy and tea farming on his one-acre piece of land. Benson has four cows from which he gets income after the sale of milk. He also uses the cow manure to grow his food crops but buys fertilizer for his tea farm.\n\nBecause his home area is very hilly, his wife and girls suffer a great deal walking up and down the hills to the nearest forest to collect wood. This takes the whole of their Saturday when they should be resting or having their family time since they have to collect enough firewood for the whole week. The big load that they have to carry makes them suffer from backaches and pains at their hip joints.\n\nTo empower this family, VEP advanced Benson a loan to construct a biodigester that will be sufficient for the family's fuel needs. With a biodigester the family will have enough energy for cooking and lighting, and this will transform their lives. The women will not suffer from drudgery and smoke-filled kitchens, and they will also have time to rest and share some family time.\n\nBenson will also no longer need to buy fertilizer, as the bio-slurry will be enough for both his crop and tea farming.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1417588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

He runs a wide variety of businesses in the district, including a local grocery shop as well as using his two vehicles to operate a taxi service. He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy an electric maize milling machine and a maize de-huller so that he can provide a milling service to over 2000 members of his community. \n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most families in Jonathan\u2019s community grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled and thickened to make what is locally called Nshima. The addition of a maize de-huller creates a further refined flour that is in high demand throughout the region. Jonathan has operated a maize milling machine in the past, so he is well positioned to succeed in this business.\n\nRent-to-Own has done extensive research in Jonathan\u2019s community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal. The closest competitor is 15km away, and since most clients walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. The addition of a maize de-huller is an extra attraction, as those wanting the more refined maize flour will be able to have the processing done in the same place as they have their maize milled. This will also draw customers from neighboring communities.\n\nThe high costs of equipment such as a maize mill and a de-huller are a major barrier, even for successful entrepreneurs like Jonathan. Once he secures a loan, Jonathan will be able to get both a maize mill and a de-huller from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his community, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. \n\nWith this maize mill and de-huller, Jonathan will be positioned to offer the only one-stop shop for maize milling in the area. He hopes to hire three employees to help with the day-to-day operation of the equipment. With this combination of equipment and his experience, Jonathan feels that he will be supporting his community with the maize milling service for years to come. This loan will help Jonathan build on his successes as an entrepreneur and build up what will surely be a viable business that can provide for his family throughout the year. It is for this reason Jonathan is asking Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure the maize mill and de-huller as soon as possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6625,"image":{"id":1416175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a maize de-huller and a maize milling machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Katete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T18:10:05Z","loan_amount":6625,"lender_count":221,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":35500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":6625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6100},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":11550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1138.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2155.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1138.38,"local_amount":6100,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6112.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419962083},{"amount":475.88,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2555.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439841795},{"amount":373.24,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-11T09:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2004.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468036067},{"amount":102.64,"local_amount":550,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-11T09:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":551.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479254243},{"amount":951.76,"local_amount":5100,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5110.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490950591},{"amount":186.62,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1002.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517890711},{"amount":289.26,"local_amount":1550,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1553.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530168243},{"amount":475.88,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2555.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542647767},{"amount":475.88,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-01T11:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2555.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561782468},{"amount":2155.46,"local_amount":11550,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-24T10:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":11574.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579739816}],"funded_date":"2013-09-05T17:15:50Z","paid_date":"2014-12-24T10:33:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":597930,"name":"Zaitoon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaitoon is 34 years old and a married woman.

He is married with one child who is 5 years old and is attending primary school. This is his third loan cycle with HOPE Congo, and he is going to use his portion of the loan to purchase prepaid phone cards from a wide variety of networks in Brazzaville, including MTN, Airtel, Warid, and Azur. He has been working in prepaid card sales since 2007 and has learned that he must help his customers use the cards properly to reload their phones and recharge their credit.

Her business is located in the city center and her main customers are women.\r\n\r\n Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about SLL 2,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000. Aminata has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to pay for additional laundry tubs, enamel spoons, coolers, and food flasks. She hopes that this loan can increase stock and raise profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n In the future, Aminata plans to expand the business to a town out of the city, and she hopes to be able to raise enough profit to educate her children.

Dora's health has deteriorated in recent years, and she no longer has the strength to work from sunrise to sunset like she has in the past. From a young age she has worked in agriculture and has leveraged her income over the years to buy a house, a tractor, a parcel of land for farming and a small truck for her family. She presently grows potatoes, corn and other crops on a small scale, but she needs more help tending and harvesting her crops these days, as she is weaker than she has been. Despite pain and challenges, Dora affirms that, \"I will work until I die, because I love the countryside and my land.\"\r\n\r\nAs an active woman with lots of energy, Dora also raises guinea pigs for resale and keeps dairy cows that she milks every day. Given her health challenges, she hopes to transition to only raising guinea pigs, as that work is easier on her body. This is her first loan with Kiva, and she promises to make all scheduled repayments on time. Dora is very grateful for the support she has received, and she plans to leverage the funds from this loan to strengthen her business and pay for a mason to build her a small shed for her guinea pigs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1417389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase building materials and build a shed where she can keep her guinea pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T19:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T19:20:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":218.04},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":224.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":235.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":241.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":256.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":263.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":274.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":285.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.04,"local_amount":218.04,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":222.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865302},{"amount":81.33,"local_amount":224.35,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":228.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353688},{"amount":85.45,"local_amount":235.74,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":240.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905449},{"amount":87.57,"local_amount":241.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":246.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091436},{"amount":92.91,"local_amount":256.29,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":261.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778030},{"amount":298.7,"local_amount":824,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":840.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598425}],"funded_date":"2013-08-29T10:11:53Z","paid_date":"2014-02-25T09:46:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":597977,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is a 25-year-old single man from Jenin City.

He is married and has four children, aged seven, fifteen, eighteen and twenty-two. He has two additional dependents, who live with him to help with the housekeeping chores.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Eddie established his business, where he sells t-shirts, button-down shirts, school bags, perfumes and umbrellas. He began his business because he wanted to be self-reliant, after coming from the mines. His business is located in the city center, and his main customers are adults. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 2,774,075 every month from this business.\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Eddie has already received and successfully repaid five loans, and now he requires a new loan in order to buy additional goods to sell, including school bags, exercise books, school shoes, socks and belts.

In order to bring in income for the family she raises livestock, having started out 43 years ago with the purchase of a cow for 2000KGS.   Thanks to her persistent hard work, Sairakan currently has a milk cow and 22 head of small livestock  on her farm.  She also has a 4-hectare plot of land on which she grows safflower and beans every year.  Her monthly income is 8000KGS.  \r\n\r\nIn order to further expand her farm, Sairakan has turned to the Bai Tushum and Partners microfinance bank for a loan of 50,000KGS to buy a cow to increase her herd.  She plans to use income from the loan to continue to grow the herd and to save up to improve her

She sells six days a week, from 8am to 5pm. She enjoys her business because of the flow of her customers and the profit she makes at the time. She started this business with money given to her by her husband. Most of the time, she uses a shared taxi to get her goods to her table.  \r\n\r\nLydia is requesting a loan to purchase door locks, hinges, nails, etc. for her business.

She has lived on the farm all her life, where she learned what she needed to know about farm work, the main activity in her region.  Thanks to this, she sells chickens and eggs and has done so for 12 years, offering her products to relatives, friends, and residents in her area.  In this way she obtained the income she needed to pay her family expenses.\r\n\r\nAmanda says that her age doesn\u2019t impede her from working hard to achieve her objectives.

He was born and raised in the field, where he learned farming, which is a family tradition.\r\n\r\nSince he began his working life, he has made his living working as a day laborer on different farms in the town where he lives. With this, he has obtained experience and a lot of knowledge in crop handling. Thanks to this, today he has crops of yams and corn, activities which alternates with his present employment at a farm.\r\n\r\nThe crops are located in land on his property which was given to him as a family heritage.

This motivates him to ask for the loan to invest in the purchase of agricultural inputs (composts, fertilizers, fungicides, and others) which are necessary to give continuity in the care of his crops. \r\n\r\nThis will allow him to have a harvest with better quality products which will be able to be sold at a good price in the market, which will be reflected in the increase in his production and his income. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it will give him more hope of getting to meet one of his main dreams, which is to increase his crops so that they provide him with economic stability.

Many years ago, she started her own business, an arepa factory in her home.  The idea came due to a difficult financial situation that her family found themselves in.  Taking advantage of the lessons her mother taught her at a young age, she has been able to generate the income to afford her household expenses.  She is hardworking, active, strong and persevering.  She works arduous days to generate a big output that will allow her to satisfy the demand.

Salamat has specialized secondary education. The neighbors speak of her as a diligent and responsible woman. Her husband and children help her with her business. The family is very friendly, and their relationship is very good. \r\n\r\nAs a main income for the family, Salamat has worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 1994, after having started this business with 10,000 som (KGS). She has long experience with breeding and keeping livestock. Thanks to Salamat's persistent work, she currently has two dairy cows, 20 sheep, two heifers and one horse on her farm. She also has a plot of land of 3.72 hectares, on which she grows beans and perennial grasses. Her agricultural business brings in around 10,000 som (KGS) per month, which is the basis for covering the family's food and household expenses. The income from the farm has allowed Salamat to raise and equip the children, and also to improve their living standard.\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Salamat turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cows. Salamat plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, and also, she intends to save up money to, in the future, pay for higher education for her grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1415148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Yintymak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salamat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":830}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":518.75,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":25151.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942579},{"amount":508.22,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":25151.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.53,"payment_id":467830880},{"amount":207.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10060.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178157},{"amount":820.7,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":40241.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.3,"payment_id":529946789}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T16:40:22Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":597965,"name":"Fatmata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 23-year-old Fatmata.

Eight years ago she started up a cafe near the local bus and taxi terminal because she needed to generate income to help support her family. As a farmer, Mar\u00eda's husband has an unstable income and is at the mercy of market forces and potentially destructive weather patterns. Mar\u00eda works seven days a week from 6:00 in the morning until 9:00 in the evening at her cafe, since she needs to take advantage of hours when the greatest number of travelers are passing through the terminal. Mar\u00eda is a hardworking and kind woman who is devoted to her family and her business.\r\n\r\nWith the support from this loan, Mar\u00eda plans to purchase merchandise to stock her cafe, including soft drinks, candy, empanadas, stuffed potatoes and other food items. She also hopes to make some improvements to her actual store to make it more appealing to travelers and potential clients. She hopes that this investment will allow her to offer a wider variety of food items to her customers and will strengthen her business so that she can improve her family's quality of life.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

together with her husband.  She has been involved in sewing national clothing for residents since 1987 and also sews dowry to-order for brides-to-be.  The business is very good, and the main thing is that Bakhtygul does her sewing work, that yields her a monthly income in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS), with satisfaction.  Despite the business losses during the instability in 2010, Bakhtygul was able to withstand and further develop her business.  In order to continue developing her business, Bakhtygul requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy materials, such as fabrics, sewing accessories, buttons, etc.  She plans to use the earnings from the loan to increase the number of dowry orders and open her own sewing

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She is a mother of six children and is motivated to provide her family with good quality food, clothing, and health expenses.\r\n\r\nNazia wants to grow the business of her husband, so she requested a loan from Kiva's field partner's BRAC Pakistan so that her husband could buy more stock of rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap and biscuits. She is an honest and regular client of BRAC Pakistan. She is in her third loan cycle with good repayment history. She is expecting a boost in her earnings and dreams of expanding the business further in the future.

Murod has decided to work on his own family business so that he can earn more money, as his current salary does not cover his family's needs. He is preparing to start a business fattening and selling big-horned cattle, and will be dividing his time between this business and his main job with the help of his wife and children. Murod's starting capital amounts to 670 Tajik somoni, and he is requesting a loan to buy four steers and calves. Murod plans to buy about four head of cattle every month, and after 30 days of feeding will sell them at the local cattle market for a profitable price.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"My first carving was done with a tree root. I loved discovering images in the natural shape of the wood. I think what I like best about my work is how you can make any kind of figure from an ordinary piece of wood. Images from Maya art are the most difficult to do but they're prettier. It's interesting to work in an area that helps keep our culture alive, the culture of our Maya ancestors and all the animals of our land. Almost all of my carvings are puzzles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear friends, thank you so much for supporting individual artisans like me, because it's not easy to complete production.

Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore.  The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.  As a result, many people on business pass through the area bringing lots of trade.  It is also the second more populous area in Liberia.\r\n \r\nMargaret has a shop which has been selling tea and cold water for the past two years.  She works at her business spending 9 hours.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is too little merchandise in her shop.  \r\n\r\nMargaret went to school and finished grade 12.  Her fiancee is working with youth and sports.  She has five children between 8 and 27 years old. Only two live at home and attend school. \r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from the loan she wants to buy more Lipton's tea and water by the sack.  She describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  She is proud of her business because she gets money every day for her expenses.\r\n  \r\nMargaret wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

Her children both work in Russia and financially support her and her husband, sending them money every month.  Urumkan's husband also actively helps her run her business.\r\n\r\nUrumkan has been involved in agriculture, crop farming and animal husbandry, since 1993, providing her family with its main source of income.  Having started in this business with an initial capital of 1,500 som (KGS), she now makes a monthly income of 8,000 som (KGS) from farming.  Thanks to her tireless work, she now owns two dairy cows and a horse and she also uses 0.9 hectares of irrigated land on which she sows sainfoin and barley every year.\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her farming business, Urumkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 135,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy one cow and one horse.  She plans to invest the earnings from this loan into further increasing her livestock headcount.  In the future, she would also like to buy some furniture."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1415202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy one cow and one horse.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Taldy-Suu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urumkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33750},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33750},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33750},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":33939.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427019},{"amount":685.01,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":33939.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.99,"payment_id":459019517},{"amount":700,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":33939,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749432},{"amount":692.15,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":33939.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.85,"payment_id":529946792}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T18:27:42Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":598079,"name":"Maame","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Although she has received no formal education, Maame is an entrepreneur.
